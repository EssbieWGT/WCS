This large-scale agency reorganization threatens DOE’s ability to sustain scientific leadership, advance clean energy deployment, and address the nation’s energy affordability crisis.","Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) unveiled a sweeping reorganization aimed at “strengthening efficiency and unleashing American energy dominance.” While these ambitions sound bold — accelerating technology, expanding energy production, and cutting bureaucracy — the structural changes inspire more questions than confidence. The new alignment signals a clear shift in priorities: offices dedicated to clean energy and energy efficiency have been renamed, consolidated, or eliminated, while new divisions elevate hydrocarbons, fusion, and a combined Office of AI & Quantum. In total, eight offices with mission-critical responsibilities have been dismantled as part of the restructuring, implementing much of the restructuring proposal outlined in Project 2025 and fundamentally reshaping the agency’s role in advancing clean energy and innovation.

This realignment comes on the heels of nearly a year of capacity cuts that have already strained the agency. Several thousand members of the DOE workforce have departed amid this administration’s DOGE-driven efforts, leaving critical functions understaffed, institutional knowledge depleted, and staff morale undermined. The erosion of large-scale demonstration and deployment capacity, and the structures that supported it, raises serious concerns about DOE’s ability to drive energy innovation at scale and implement real-world infrastructure upgrades. At the same time, sectors that rely on DOE’s support are witnessing a general loss of capacity at the agency, eroding trust in government and its ability to deliver on its stated mission.

The financial and operational costs of restructuring a large federal agency can be staggering. Lost productivity alone often runs into the millions, as staff and leadership divert time and focus from mission-critical work toward the reorganization. In this context, DOE’s restructuring risks weakening — rather than strengthening — the American innovation engine responsible for advancing both basic science and demonstration and deployment at scale. Gutting DOE’s deployment, infrastructure, and clean energy programs also undermines the agency’s ability to carry out the critical functions needed to address today’s most pressing energy challenges, as electricity demand continues to outpace supply and utility bills rise rapidly.

Looking ahead, this reorganization poses important long-term questions: how would one rebuild the structures necessary for large-scale demonstration and deployment? How can DOE rapidly respond to growing domestic energy challenges amid reduced capacity? And how can the agency restore staff morale, retain institutional knowledge, and rebuild trust with the sectors that rely on its leadership? Far from delivering efficiency or strength, this reorganization risks institutionalizing the losses and instability at DOE that have already been set in motion.

Exacerbating Staff Losses and Project Cancellations

The reorganization has been marked by limited communication with DOE staff, leaving many employees uncertain about how their roles and teams will be affected. Concerns about potential reductions in force have heightened anxiety among DOE staff, and a poor transition to the new organizational structure could drive additional staff to depart of their own accord. Either or both would compound the effects of previous layoffs, the Deferred Resignation Program, and other aggressive staffing actions already undertaken by the administration on DOE’s workforce capacity.

While some turnover in staff is to be expected at the start of a new administration, this administration has pursued an unprecedented and aggressive series of actions to reduce the federal workforce. Early on, DOE leadership laid off probationary employees en masse—sources range between 555 to up to 2,000—and placed 25 staffers from the Office of Energy Justice and Equity on leave.

The biggest impact on career staff has been the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), which incentivized employees to voluntarily resign with pay and benefits through the end of FY25, or risk losing their jobs in future reductions in force. DOE staff data obtained by FAS show that 3,051 federal employees took the DOGE-sponsored DRP offer. (FAS will soon release a report with more analysis of this data.) Given this significant attrition, it is imperative that DOE leaders determine how to best transition staff into their new roles, to maintain as much certainty as possible as the agency navigates ongoing capacity challenges within a new structure.

Lost capacity will also impact DOE’s awards. Nearly 350 projects across multiple DOE offices have received cancellation notices, issued either in May or October. Awardees — many tied to offices now eliminated under the reorganization — have reported slow or nonexistent communication from DOE even before the restructuring took effect. As DOE’s political leadership moves forward with mass termination actions, recipients are left attempting to navigate informal dispute processes or pursue mutually acceptable resolutions with limited guidance or transparency. Reversing independently vetted, merit-based technical awards at this scale is highly unusual and has already brought about significant dysfunction, raising serious concerns as the reorganization proceeds.

The broader instability created by this upheaval will likely make it harder for the hundreds of businesses and state and local governments that are seeking to contest their grant terminations, as well as the thousands of other organizations that administer DOE-funded projects in service of the American people.

Clean Energy Innovation & Deployment Impacts

The reorganization also dramatically reshapes offices responsible for clean energy innovation and deployment. At a time when electricity prices are rising, demand growth is outpacing new supply, and grid infrastructure is aging, stepping away from applied innovation and deployment programs is a costly mistake that threatens affordability and reliability.

Most notably, the reorganization creates a new Office of Critical Minerals & Energy Innovation, with significant breadth and responsibility and a direct line of report to the Secretary. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which among other things manages DOE’s work to make it easier to build new renewable energy projects and improve U.S. industry, will now mostly be consolidated under this office. The new office’s name signals a potential deprioritization of energy innovation behind critical minerals priorities. It also raises questions: how will renewable energy, manufacturing, industrial, and built environment programs — all essential to energy affordability — be integrated and staffed? How will existing programs under EERE and other offices be reorganized within this sprawling new structure? Will applied innovation and deployment functions, like supporting states with improved siting and permitting of new power plants, continue to exist?

For critical minerals, consolidating work previously scattered across FE, EERE, and MESC may improve program coordination and definitely elevates this important issue. The office reports directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, reflecting a top-down, highly centralized approach to managing critical minerals programs. However, there is no dedicated funding line for critical minerals, raising questions about how funding will be pieced together for this office and long-term program sustainability.

This new restructure also eliminates the offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), Fossil Energy (FE), and State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP). While elements of these offices and their programs may wind up in the large new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, shuttering these offices emphasizes a de-prioritization of their functions and missions by DOE leadership.

Additionally, to meet our urgent energy infrastructure challenges and ensure that innovations translate into real world impact, the US needs to be building large-scale demonstrations of the newest energy technologies domestically. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) did just that. It supported first-of-a-kind or next-generation projects to de-risk technologies to enable quicker commercialization. This new organizational structure nearly fully guts any remaining demonstration and deployment apparatuses at DOE.

For critical minerals, consolidating work previously scattered across FE, EERE, and MESC may improve efficiency and elevate this important issue. The office reports directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, reflecting a top-down, highly centralized approach to managing critical minerals programs. However, several details remain unclear: there is no dedicated funding line for critical minerals, raising questions about long-term program sustainability.

On another technology front, consolidation of geothermal and fossil programs could be a good outcome for geothermal innovation. The reorg creates a new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Office, which merges the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) with the Fossil Energy Office (FE). Previously, both GTO and FE were housed under the Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Innovation (S4); the new combined office will now report to the Office of the new Under Secretary for Energy (S3). One way to conceptualize this merger is as an “Office of Underground Resources,” which could be a logical alignment given the technical and operational overlap between geothermal and fossil energy programs. The restructuring may also provide an opportunity for geothermal to access additional funding streams that were previously less available.

Impacts on Basic Science

The DOE reorganization introduces major shifts with significant implications for the agency’s basic science mission, particularly in fusion and quantum research.

One notable change is the creation of a dedicated Fusion office under S4, a move long advocated by industry. Pulling fusion out of the Office of Science (SC) may make sense at this stage: the field is transitioning into applied programs that require outcome-oriented management. Still, critical basic research needs remain — particularly around plasma-facing components like the blanket — which demand the scientific rigor and oversight traditionally provided by a science-focused office. Separating fusion from the broader SC could help reconcile the tension between applied and basic work, but execution will be key, particularly in light of DOE’s ongoing workforce reductions. Industry perspectives have been overwhelmingly positive, and former Fusion Energy Science staff reportedly also view the change favorably. Under the Office of Science, fusion increasingly had to compete with more fundamental research projects that push the boundaries of human knowledge, as opposed to energy technology.

By contrast, the creation of a combined Office of AI & Quantum raises deep concerns about both scientific coherence and organizational capacity. Quantum information science (QIS) is still largely in a foundational research phase, relying on robust support from the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR), Basic Energy Sciences (BES), High Energy Physics (HEP), and other programs in the Office of Science to build knowledge to eventually transfer technology into industry. If quantum information science and technology programs are pulled out of the Office of Science, it could risk destabilizing established programs that benefit from their close interaction with fundamental research activities while prematurely advancing commercial quantum solutions.

Grouping quantum with AI — a technology already widely deployed and primarily application-driven — conflates fundamentally different stages of development, obscuring programmatic priorities and scientific needs. These structural choices are particularly risky given DOE’s (and particularly the Office of Science’s) massively depleted workforce, not to mention the enormous costs and operational challenges associated with large-scale federal reorganizations. Lost productivity and gaps in institutional knowledge could delay critical research, compromise collaboration across DOE-operated laboratories, and weaken the nation’s basic science enterprise at a moment when long-term investment in emerging technologies is most urgent.

Additional structural alignment concerns extend to offices like the Office of Technology Commercialization (OTC, formerly OTT), which spans both applied and basic domains but is more appropriately aligned with applied energy offices rather than SC. Conversely, the creation of OSTR is an interesting development: previously, functions such as liftoff reports and AI/data center analyses were handled in-house by specific program offices, and centralizing these functions could improve coordination if implemented effectively, but they could also limit the expertise and detail that made these reports valuable in the past. Similar challenges exist as a result of the Department’s reorganization of its scientific advisory committees into a single entity earlier this year.

Questions Remain

The DOE reorganization leaves several critical questions unanswered, raising concerns about the agency’s ability to deliver on its stated mission:

Budgeting and appropriations: How does this new structure align with existing appropriations accounts, and will it make budgeting even more complicated for Congress, DOE leadership, and program offices?

Workforce capacity: With DOE’s workforce already reduced by nearly a third over the past year, can the agency realistically execute such sweeping changes without undermining mission-critical programs, basic research, and demonstration and deployment efforts?

Mission alignment: How does the reorganization of energy innovation and deployment offices advance the administration’s goal of “delivering affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people” – or does it risk leaving a critical gap in execution? Also, what are the actual missions of these new offices and where have programs under previous offices been moved?

Product value: Does the consolidation of responsibilities into coordinating functions improve efficiency, or does it water down the products produced and released by the Department? The volume of earlier products produced by the Department may have been difficult to track, but the domain-sensitive expertise built into recommendations generally represented a gold standard of policy analysis and mission-orientation.

These remaining questions highlight the tension between ambitious structural change and the practical limits of an understaffed, under-resourced agency. This large-scale agency reorganization threatens DOE’s ability to sustain scientific leadership, advance clean energy deployment, and address the nation’s energy affordability crisis.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1124-doe-reorg-2.png,N,,2025-11-26 04:59:12.769649

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable.","At the dawning of the British Empire in 1818, the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned a memorable sonnet freighted with foreboding about the inevitable decline of all empires, whether in ancient Egypt or then-modern Britain.

In Shelly’s stanzas, a traveler in Egypt comes across the ruins of a once-monumental statue, with “a shattered visage lying half sunk” in desert sands bearing the “sneer of cold command.” Only its “trunkless legs of stone” remain standing. Yet the inscription carved on those stones still proclaims: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” And in a silent mockery of such imperial hubris, all the trappings of that awesome power, all the palaces and fortresses, have been utterly erased, leaving only a desolation “boundless and bare” as “the lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Taken too literally, those verses might lead us to anticipate some future traveler finding fragments of St. Paul’s Cathedral scattered on the banks of the Thames River in London or stones from the Washington Monument strewn in a kudzu-covered field near the Potomac. Shelley is, however, offering us a more profound lesson that every empire teaches and every imperialist then forgets: Imperial ascent begets an inevitable decline.

Imperial Washington

Indeed, these days Donald Trump’s Washington abounds with monuments to overblown imperial grandeur and plans for more, all of which add up to an unconvincing denial that America’s global imperium is facing an Ozymandias-like fate. With his future Gilded Age ballroom meant to rise from the rubble of the White House’s East Wing, his plans for a massive triumphal arch at the city’s entrance, and a military parade of tanks and troops clanking down Constitution Avenue on his birthday, who could ever imagine such a thing? Not Donald Trump, that’s for sure.

In a celebration of his “works” that are supposedly making the “mighty despair” in foreign capitals around the world, his former national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has recently argued in Foreign Affairs that the president’s “policy of peace through strength” is reversing a Democrat-induced decline of U.S. global power. According to O’Brien, instead of crippling NATO (as his critics claim), President Trump is “leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era”; unleashing military innovation “to counter China”; and proving himself the “indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to… long-standing disputes” in Gaza, the Congo, and, quite soon, Ukraine as well. Even in North America, according to O’Brien, Trump’s attempt to acquire Greenland has forced Denmark to expand its military presence, putting Russia on notice that the West will compete for control of the Arctic.

As it happens, whatever the truth of any of that may be, the policy elements that O’Brien cites are certain to prove largely irrelevant to the ceaseless struggle for geopolitical power among the globe’s great empires. Or, to borrow a favorite Trumpian epithet from the president’s “cornucopia of crudeness,” in the relentless, often ruthless world of grand strategy, none of those factors amounts to a hill of “shit.”

Indeed, O’Brien’s epic catalogue of Trump’s supposed foreign policy successes cleverly avoids any mention of the central factor in the rise and fall of every dominant world power for the past 500 years: energy. While the United States made genuine strides toward a green energy revolution under President Joe Biden, his successor, the “drill, baby, drill” president, has seemed determined not just to destroy those gains, but to revert to dependence on fossil fuels “bigly,” as Trump would say. In a perplexing paradox, President Trump’s systematic attack on alternative energy at home will almost certainly subvert America’s geopolitical power abroad. How and why? Let me explain by dipping my toes in a bit of history.

For the past five centuries, the rise of every global empire has rested on an underlying transformation (or perhaps revolution would be a more accurate word for it) in the form of energy that drove its version of the world economy. Innovation in the basic force behind its rising global presence gave each successive hegemonic power — Portugal, Spain, England, the United States, and possibly now China — a critical competitive advantage, cutting costs and increasing profits. That energy innovation and the lucrative commerce it created infused each successive imperium with intangible but substantial power, impelling its armed forces relentlessly forward and crushing resistance to its rule, whether by local groups or would-be imperial rivals. Although scholars of imperial history often ignore it, energy should be considered, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, the determinative factor in the rise and fall of every global hegemon for the past five centuries.

Iberia’s Mastery of Muscle

In the fifteenth century, the Iberian powers — Portugal and Spain — manipulated the ocean winds and maximized the energy output of the human body, giving them new forms of energy that allowed their arid lands and limited populations to conquer much of the globe. By replacing the square sail of lumbering Mediterranean ships with a triangular sail, agile Portuguese vessels like the famed caravela de armada doubled their capacity to tack close to the wind, allowing them to master the world’s oceans.

By 1500, Portuguese warships had navigation instruments that allowed them to cross the widest bodies of water, sails to beat into the strongest headwinds, a sturdy hull for guns and cargo, and lethal cannons that could destroy enemy fleets or breach the walls of port cities. As a result, a small flotilla of Portuguese caravels soon conquered colonies on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean and seized control of Asian sea lanes from the Red Sea to the Java Sea.

For the next three centuries, such sailing ships would transport 11 million African captives across the Atlantic to work as slaves in a new form of agriculture that was both exceptionally cruel and extraordinarily profitable: the sugar plantation. The output of Europe’s free yeoman farmers was then constrained by the limits of the individual body and the temperate climate’s short six-month growing season. By contrast, enslaved laborers, massed into efficient teams in tropical latitudes, were driven year-round to the brink of death and beyond to extract unprecedented productivity and profits from those plantations. Indeed, even as late as the nineteenth century, the U.S. southern slave plantation was, according to an econometric analysis, 35% more efficient than a northern family farm.

After developing the sugar plantation, or fazenda, as a new form of agribusiness on small islands off the coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese brought that system to Brazil in the sixteenth century. From there, it migrated to European colonies in the Caribbean, making that cruel commerce synonymous with the slave trade for nearly four centuries. So profitable was the slave plantation for its owners that, unlike almost every other form of production, it did not die from natural economic causes but would instead require the full force of the British navy to do it in.

The Dutch Harness the Winds

But the true masters of wind power would prove to be the Dutch, whose technological prowess would allow their small land, devoid of natural resources, to conquer a colonial empire that spanned three continents. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch drive for scientific innovation led them to harness the winds as never before, building sailing ships 10 times the size of a Portuguese caravel and windmills that, among other things, replaced the tedious hand sawing of logs to produce lumber for shipbuilding. With giant sails spanning over 90 feet, a five-ton shaft generating up to 50 horsepower, and several sawing frames with six steel blades each, a windmill’s four-man crew could turn 60 tree trunks a day into uniform planks to maintain the massive Dutch merchant fleet of 4,000 ocean-going ships.

By 1650, the Zaan district near Amsterdam, arguably Europe’s first major industrial area, had more than 50 wind-driven sawmills and was the world’s largest shipyard, launching 150 hulls annually (at half the cost of English-built vessels). Many of these were the Dutch-designed fluitschip, an agile three-masted cargo vessel that cut crew size, doubled sailing speed, and could carry 500 tons of cargo with exceptional efficiency.

Through its commercial acumen and mastery of wind power, tiny Holland defeated the mighty Spanish empire in the Thirty Years War (1618-48), then fought the British to a standstill in three massive naval wars, while building an empire that reached around the world — from the Spice Islands of Indonesia to the city of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan.

When Coal Was King

As Holland’s commercial empire began to fade, however, Great Britain was already launching an energy transition to coal-fired steam energy that would leave the wind and muscle power of the Iberian age in the dust of history. And the industrial revolution that went with it would build the world’s first truly global empire.

The Scottish inventor James Watt perfected the steam engine by 1784. Such machines began driving railways in 1825 and the Royal Navy’s warships in the 1840s. By then, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide — driving sawmills, pulling gang plows, and sculpting the earth’s surface with steam shovels, steam dredges, and steam rollers. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States would triple from 56,000 units to 156,000, accounting for 77% of all American industrial power. To fuel that age of steam and steel, Britain’s coal production climbed to a peak of 290 million tons in 1913, while worldwide production reached 1.3 billion tons.

Coal was the catalyst for an industrial revolution that fused steam technology with steel production to make Britain the master of the world’s oceans. From the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tiny Britain with just 40 million people would preside over a global empire that controlled a quarter of all humanity directly through colonies and another quarter indirectly through client states. In addition to its vast territorial empire, Britannia ruled the world’s waves, while its pound sterling became the global reserve currency, and London the financial center of the planet.

America’s Petrol-Powered Hegemony

Just as Britain’s imperial age had coincided with its coal-driven industrial revolution, so Washington’s brand-new world order focused on crude oil to feed the voracious energy needs of its global economy. By 1950, in the wake of World War II, the U.S. petrol-powered economy was producing half the world’s economic output and using that raw economic power for commercial and military dominion over most of the planet (outside the Sino-Soviet communist bloc).

By 1960, the Pentagon had built a nuclear triad that gave it a formidable strategic deterrent, as five nuclear-powered submarines armed with atomic warheads trolled the ocean depths, while 14 nuclear-armed aircraft carriers patrolled the world’s oceans. Flying from 500 U.S. overseas military bases, the Strategic Air Command had 1,700 bombers ready for nuclear strikes.

As American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 200 million in 2000, the country’s oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million. During those same decades, the federal government spent $370 billion to cover the country with 46,000 miles of interstate highways, allowing cars and trucks to replace railroads as the ribs of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.

To drive the carbon-fueled economy of Washington’s world order, there would be a dramatic, five-fold increase in the global consumption of liquid fossil fuels during the last half of the twentieth century. As the number of motor vehicles worldwide kept climbing, crude oil rose from 27% of global fossil-fuel consumption in 1950 to 44% by 2003, surpassing coal to become the world’s main source of energy.

To meet this relentlessly rising demand, the Middle East’s share of global oil production climbed from just 7% in 1945 to 35% in 2003. As the self-appointed guardian of the Persian Gulf whose vast oil reserves represented some 60% of the world’s total, Washington would become embroiled in endless wars in that tumultuous region, from the Gulf War of 1990-91 to its present-day interventions in Israel and Iran.

Whether thanks to Britain’s coal-fired factories or America’s auto traffic, all those carbon emissions were already producing signs of global warming that, by the 1990s, would set alarm bells ringing among scientists worldwide. From the “pre-industrial” baseline of 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1880, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere kept climbing to 410 ppm by 2018, resulting in the rising seas, devastating fires, raging storms, and protracted droughts that came to be known as global warming.

As evidence of the climate crisis became undeniable, the world’s nations responded with striking unanimity by signing the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to cut carbon emissions and surge investments into alternative energy that soon yielded significant breakthroughs in both cost and efficiency. Within four years, the International Energy Agency predicted that dramatic drops in the cost of solar panels meant that solar energy would soon be “the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Indeed, as technology slashed the cost of battery storage and solar panels, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2024 that the solar generation of electricity had become 41% cheaper than fossil fuels, while offshore wind was 53% cheaper — a truly significant disparity that will, as technology continues to slash the cost of solar energy, render the use of coal and natural gas for electricity an economic irrationality, if not an utter absurdity.

In the game of empires, seemingly small margins can have large consequences, often marking the difference between dominance and subordination, success and failure — whether the 35% advantage of enslaved over free labor, the 50% cost advantage for Dutch sailing craft over British ones, and now a 41% savings for solar over fossil fuels. Moreover, the day is fast coming when fossil-fuel electricity will cost more than twice as much as alternative energy from solar and wind power.

To assure America’s economic future, the administration of President Joe Biden began investing trillions of dollars in alternative energy by building battery plants, encouraging massive wind and solar projects, and continuing a consumer subsidy to sustain Detroit’s transition to electric vehicles. In January 2025, however, Donald Trump entered the White House (again) determined to roll back the global green revolution. After quitting the Paris climate accord and labeling climate change a “hoax” or “the green new scam,” President Trump has halted construction of major offshore wind projects, ended the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, and opened yet more federal lands for coal and oil leases. Armed with extraordinary executive powers and a single-minded determination, he will predictably delay, if not derail, America’s transition to alternative energy, missing market opportunities and undercutting the country’s economic competitiveness by chaining it to overpriced fossil fuels.

China’s Green-Energy Ride to Global Power

While Washington was demolishing America’s green energy infrastructure, Beijing has been working to make China a global powerhouse for alternative energy. Ten years ago, its leaders launched a “Made in China 2025” program to storm the heights of the global economy by becoming the world leader in 10 strategic industries, eight of which involved some aspect of the green-energy transformation, including “new materials,” “high-tech ships,” “advanced railways,” “energy-saving and new energy vehicles,” and “energy equipment.” Those “new materials” include China’s virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, which are absolutely critical to the manufacturing of the key components for renewable energy — specifically, wind turbines, solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and hydrogen extraction. In sum, Beijing is already riding the green energy revolution in a serious bid to become the world’s “leading manufacturing superpower” by 2049, while erasing America’s economic edge and its global hegemony in the bargain.

So, you might ask, have any of those seemingly pie-in-the-sky plans already become an economic reality? Given China’s recent progress in key energy sectors, the answer is a resounding yes.

Under its economic plan, China has already come to dominate the world’s solar power industry. In 2024, it cut the wholesale price of its solar panel exports in half and nearly doubled its exports of panel components. To replace its old export “trio” of clothing, furniture, and appliances, Beijing has mandated a “new trio” of solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric cars. And to put what’s happening in perspective, imagine that, in just the month of May, China installed enough wind and solar energy to power a country as big as Poland, reaching an impressive figure that represents half the world’s “total installed solar capacity.” By 2024, China was already producing at least 80% of the world’s solar panel components, dominating the global market, and undercutting would-be competitors in Europe and the U.S. Driving all that explosive growth, China’s investment in clean energy has reached nearly $2 trillion, representing 10% of its gross domestic product, and has been growing at three times the rate of its overall economy, meaning it would soon account for a full 20% of its entire economy.

With similar determination, its electric vehicles (EVs) are now beginning to capture the global car market. By 2024, 17.3 million electric cars were made worldwide, and China produced 70% of them. Not only are Chinese companies opening massive robotic assembly plants worldwide to crank out such cars by the millions, but they are also making the world’s cheapest and best cars — with the YangWang U9-X hitting a world speed record of 308 miles per hour; BYD’s latest plug-in hybrid models, priced at only $13,700 and capable of traveling a record 1,200 miles on a single charge and single tank of gas; the YangWang U8 with a capacity to literally drive across water; and the Xiaomi SU-7 displaying a high-tech driver interface that makes a Tesla look like a Ford Pinto.

Since an EV is just a steel box with a battery, technology will soon allow low-cost electric vehicles to completely eradicate gas guzzlers, enabling China to conquer the global car market — with full electric cars like the self-driving BYD Seagull sedan already priced at $8,000, models like BYD’s Han with a 5-minute charge time that’s faster than pumping a tank of gas, and sedans like the Nio ET7 with a standard range on a single charge of 620 miles. And most of that extraordinary technological progress has happened in less than four years, essentially the time remaining in Donald Trump’s second term in office.

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future

By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable. Amid an historic transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure (comparable in scope and scale to the coal-fired industrial revolution), the United States will spend the next three years under his watch digging coal and burning oil and natural gas, while the rest of the industrial world follows China as it pursues technological innovation to the furthest frontiers of the human imagination. Indeed, the latest annual report from the world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, states bluntly that the transition away from fossil fuels is “inevitable” as the world, “led by a surge in cheap solar power in… the Middle East and Asia,” installs more green energy capacity in the next five years than it has in the last 40 combined.

By the time Donald Trump leaves office in 2029, this country will be distinctly on the imperial decline amid fast-paced changes that will make electric vehicles universal and solar-powered electricity an economic imperative. And just as the Dutch used energy technology to capture their imperial moment in the seventeenth century, so the Chinese will undoubtedly do the same in this century.

After all, how can the United States produce competitive products, even for domestic consumption (much less export), if our costs for energy, the basic component of every economic activity, become double those of our competitors? Simply put, it won’t be possible.

If, however, when Donald Trump’s term in office is done, this country moves quickly to recover its capacity for economic rationality, it should be able to regain some version of its place in the world economy. For once, the United States rejoins the green energy revolution, it can use its formidable engineering ingenuity to accelerate the development of this transformative technology — simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions that are choking the planet and securing the livelihoods of average American workers in the bargain.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/matthew-henry-yETqkLnhsUI-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 02:58:11.660473

The resulting decision secured some important wins, both inside and outside the negotiations. But it omitted some of the big-ticket items many hoped to see.

With efforts to halt temperature rise severely off track and climate disasters becoming ever-more destructive, the summit (COP30) aimed to establish clear pathways to deliver past pledges and put the world on a safer track. A key question was how countries would address lagging ambition in their new climate commitments (NDCs). Hopes that countries would commit to roadmaps to end fossil fuel use and halt deforestation were ultimately dashed after opposition from petrostates. The final decision only included new voluntary initiatives to accelerate national climate action, though the Brazilian Presidency intends to move forward with fossil fuel and deforestation roadmaps outside of the formal COP talks.

Other areas were brighter.

Building resilience to climate impacts took center stage, with COP30 securing a new target to triple finance for climate adaptation. The COP also laid out practical solutions to increase finance for the low-carbon transition. In an era of trade wars and tariffs, negotiators also agreed for the first time to hold discussions on how trade policies can help — or hinder — climate action.

Against the backdrop of the Amazon, nature also saw advances, including a new fund for tropical forest conservation. Indigenous Peoples and other local communities were recognized like never before. And outside the formal negotiations, the summit saw a raft of new pledges and action plans from cities, states, countries and the private sector. It is clear that we are moving from negotiations to implementation, and from wrangling over what to do to how to do it.

These victories matter. It shows that international cooperation can still deliver, despite deepening divides on climate action and a difficult geopolitical context.

Here, we take a closer look at the outcomes from COP30 and what’s needed next:

National Climate Plans

Adaptation

Finance

Nature

People-Centered Action

Trade

Sectoral Action

Responding to the NDC Shortfall

By the end of COP30, 119 countries representing 74% of global emissions had submitted new national commitments in NDCs. These commitments showed some progress on reducing emissions and mobilizing sectoral action, but they collectively deliver less than 15% of the emissions reductions required by 2035 to hold global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. UN analysis finds that even with the latest NDCs and current policies, the world remains on course for 2.3-2.8 degrees C of warming, a dangerous prospect that’s well above the Paris Agreement’s temperature benchmarks.

This emissions gap shaped expectations heading into COP30, with countries seeking a credible response to the NDC shortfall. A central and politically charged issue was how the world would address the continued use of fossil fuels, the root cause of the climate crisis. More than 80 countries advocated for a global roadmap to guide this transition, but negotiators ultimately failed to include it in the final decision, stymied by opposition from several countries — in particular, major petrostates.

Instead, COP30 launched two new initiatives, under the guidance of the COP Presidencies: a Global Implementation Accelerator and the “Belem Mission to 1.5” to enhance and speed the implementation of countries’ NDCs and national adaptation plans (NAPs) and keep 1.5 degrees C within reach. Neither of these voluntary initiatives directly mention fossil fuels, disappointing countries seeking clearer direction. However, the language for the Accelerator does include a thin thread linking it to the Global Stocktake commitments made at COP28 in Dubai, thus implicitly referring to the language adopted there on a just, orderly transition away from fossil fuels.

The Brazilian COP30 president also announced that it will develop roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and tackle deforestation in its own capacity. It’s ultimately up to Brazil President Lula da Silva and the COP presidency to advance these global plans in a robust and inclusive way.

For the first time in a COP decision, negotiators also acknowledged the likelihood of overshooting 1.5 degrees C and the need to limit both its magnitude and duration. Finally, although many countries now have 2030, 2035 and net-zero emissions targets, COP30 gave little attention to updating long-term emissions strategies — essential complements to near-term emissions targets.

Looking ahead to next year, the Global Implementation Accelerator will hold open information sessions in June and November before delivering a report and high-level meeting at COP31 in November 2026. The Belém Mission to 1.5 will follow a similar timeline and likewise report its conclusions at COP31. In parallel, the COP30 Presidency’s roadmap development will be informed by external consultations, including an April meeting on transitioning away from fossil fuels, co-hosted by the Colombian and Dutch governments.

Adapting to Climate Impacts

A key task for negotiators was finalizing how the Paris Agreement’s Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) will be put into action, including establishing indicators to track progress.

In the end, negotiators adopted a set of 59 indicators across seven sectors, such as water, agriculture and health, and the adaptation policy planning process, including on finance, capacity building and technology transfer. The list also takes into account cross-cutting considerations such as gender and human rights. But it was a bumpy process and an ultimately mixed outcome.

In the final days of COP, many negotiators were surprised to see most of the indicators — developed by 78 independent experts over the course of the last two years — were altered. The final set includes some indicators that are unmeasurable and thematically incomplete, creating technical issues to work through. In the final plenary, some countries raised objections to the GGA outcome, which, after some controversy over process, the COP Presidency promised to address at the Bonn climate talks in June 2026.

The GGA indicators will need further refinement, part of which will be addressed through a two-year “Belém-Addis vision” process. However, it’s unclear if countries will be willing to start using the indicators agreed at COP30 if they may change in the next two years.

Meanwhile, loss and damage, which addresses the most severe impacts of climate change, received relatively little attention compared to previous COPs. Negotiators did review the Warsaw International Mechanism and made some progress, including kickstarting a new State of Loss and Damage Report, developing guidance to integrate Loss and Damage into national plans, and enhancing coherence within the Paris Agreement’s loss and damage architecture. Parties also agreed on new guidance for the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), linking it to the new climate-finance goal agreed at COP29. The FRLD launched the call for funding requests for its start-up phase, the Barbados Implementation Modalities (BIM).

Finance for Developing Countries

Expectations were high for countries to determine what’s next for adaptation finance, given that the 2021 Glasgow COP pledge to double adaptation finance from 2019 levels expires this year. Parties were divided on whether to establish a new adaptation finance target, how big it should be and over what timeframe, with many developing countries calling for a tripling by 2030. The COP concluded with a call to at least triple finance for adaptation by 2035, a welcome development, albeit on a longer timeline than many had hoped. This means that of the $300 billion+ in climate finance that should flow to developing countries by 2035, $120 billion or so should go toward adapting and building resilience to climate change impacts.

COP30 also brought further dialogue on how to scale up finance from all sources to reach the broader target of $1.3 trillion for developing countries by 2035. The COP29 and COP30 presidencies presented the Baku to Belem Roadmap to 1.3T, laying out key actions governments, financial institutions and others can take to finance climate mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. This is an important step-change in the approach to finance. It recognizes the importance of all sources playing their part and the value of finance working better together as a system, including through ‘country platforms.’ Negotiators took note of the roadmap and decided to urgently advance actions listed within it. However, they did not discuss its recommendations in detail, which, for example, include actions to reduce debt and improve incentives for private sector investments in developing nations.

Some negotiators threatened to hold up the negotiations unless Article 9.1 of the Paris Agreement was discussed. This article spells out the responsibility of developed countries to provide finance for developing nations. Countries eventually agreed to a two-year work programme to continue discussions. They also created a dialogue for continued conversation on Article 2.1(c), which calls for alignment of all global financial flows with mitigation and adaptation goals.

Ultimately, financial decisions are made in many venues and institutions across the globe, from multilateral development banks to the G20, which met last weekend. Decision-makers must work together to direct finance toward solutions for global people, nature and climate goals, and away from activities that undermine them. The Baku to Belem Roadmap and the Circle of Ministers Reports provide a useful guide for this.

Protecting and Restoring Nature

Despite COP30’s location in Belem, the gateway to the Amazon rainforest, negotiators ultimately failed to launch a global roadmap for ending deforestation. Still, COP30 brought other important wins for nature conservation.

Brazil officially launched its Tropical Forests Forever Facility to provide long-term, predictable finance to countries that protect their tropical forests. The innovative approach aims to shift the economics of deforestation so that maintaining standing forests is more profitable than clearing them. A handful of countries — including Brazil, Indonesia, France, Germany and Norway — pledged a total of $6.7 billion for the fund. That’s a start toward Brazil’s initial target of $25 billion, but more momentum is needed. For example, China and the U.K. signaled that they may come through with funding pledges next year.

Countries also renewed the Forest and Land Tenure pledge, committing $1.8 billion in funding through 2030 and expanding coverage beyond forests to savannas, mangroves and other ecosystems. Fifteen governments launched the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment, which aims to secure and formally recognize 160 million hectares of land held and used by Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Brazil announced new protections for Indigenous territories, and Indonesia pledged to do so. These outcomes demonstrate a major shift in recognizing the role that Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants, and local communities play in protecting the ecosystems that sustain us all.

Countries also announced new efforts to tackle the major challenges facing nature. Over 40 countries endorsed a call to action to fight wildfires, the leading cause of forest loss last year. Brazil launched the Bioeconomy Challenge, a global platform to increase investment in sustainable forest economy markets. And 10 countries announced their support for a Brazil-led accelerator to restore the world’s degraded and underproductive farmland.

Ocean conservation also advanced. Brazil joined the Ocean Panel, committing to sustainably manage all of its national waters by 2030 — the world’s 10th largest ocean area. And six more countries joined the Blue NDC Challenge to deliver ocean-climate actions: Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal and Singapore.

Putting People at the Heart of Climate Action

COP30 brought a refreshingly new focus “to connect the climate regime to people’s real lives.” This theme ran through the People’s March, where over 70,000 people took to the streets calling for climate justice and action. The first Global Ethical Stocktake, launched by President Lula and Minister Marina Silva along with UN Secretary-General António Guterres, with participation from WRI's Wanjira Mathai, reinforced that fairness, inclusion and shared responsibility must guide climate decisions and prioritize those most affected by climate change’s impacts.

The adoption of a process to develop a “just transition mechanism” marked the furthest a COP has gone to address workers’ and communities’ rights. It aims to strengthen international cooperation, provide technical assistance and capacity-building, share knowledge, and support equitable, inclusive transitions to low-carbon economies. While some noted disappointment that it does not include specific references to critical minerals or fossil fuels, the decision to develop the mechanism remains a significant step forward. Negotiators and other stakeholders will share their views on the process for developing the mechanism by March 2026, with a recommended process for its operationalization to be considered in November 2026.

The summit also marked an unprecedented effort to include Indigenous voices. Over 2,500 Indigenous Peoples participated in COP30, supported by initiatives like the Peoples’ Circle, an advisory body highlighting their perspectives to the COP Presidency. At least three COP documents explicitly recognize Indigenous rights: the Global Mutirão affirms their land rights and traditional knowledge; the mitigation work program highlights their vital role in sustainable forest management and calls for long-term recognition of their land rights; and the just transition mechanism refers to rights and protections for Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact.

Countries also developed a new Gender Action Plan, setting the stage for gender-responsive climate policy. The initiative supports gender-responsive finance and promotes the leadership of Indigenous, Afro-descendant and rural women.

Jobs and economic opportunity were also prominent themes, with a clear takeaway that embracing the low-carbon transition can deliver growth, investment, security, competitiveness and good-paying jobs. Developed in collaboration with the COP30 Presidency and a broad coalition of international partners, the Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy was launched to prepare workforces for a rapidly evolving economy and build a movement for green, inclusive jobs. Countries also launched the Belém Declaration on Global Green Industrialization, providing a framework for scaling new industrial systems and creating employment opportunities in emerging green sectors.

Health also featured prominently. The World Health Organization launched the Belém Health Action Plan, citing 60 actions necessary to both adapt to climate change and address climate-related health risks affecting 3.3 billion people. Over 30 countries endorsed the plan and agreed to report their progress during the next Global Stocktake at COP33 in 2028.

Trade Policies Linked to Climate Action

COP30 marked an important shift in the recognition of trade policies as being closely interlinked with climate action. This reflects the degree to which climate action is increasingly seen as integral to broader economic transformation, and how economic systems can either act as barriers or catalysts to the pace, scale and distributional impacts of the transition. At the beginning of the COP, some developing countries pressed for the formal agenda to include discussion of “unilateral trade measures” related to climate policies. While the adopted agenda never reflected that call, the outcome in the Global Mutirão decision, the centerpiece of COP30 outcomes, included dialogues on trade and climate.

The outcome reaffirmed that countries should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that enhances efforts to combat climate change. To enable better communication and discussion among countries on those issues, dialogues will be held over the next three years during the UNFCCC intersessional meetings in June each year. Those dialogues will include participation from the WTO and other international economic organizations and will look at opportunities and challenges at the nexus of trade and climate, culminating in a report in 2028.

Trade also featured in the new Integrated Forum on Climate Change and Trade, introduced by President Lula during the World Leaders’ Summit held just before COP30. By positioning itself outside the international climate and trade regimes, the Forum will help develop mutually reinforcing solutions at the intersection of climate and trade policies, in areas such as the energy transition, deforestation and carbon accounting.

Advancing Action Across Sectors

The COP30 Presidency and High-Level Climate Champions released the COP30 Action Agenda, which unites hundreds of climate initiatives across sectors and actors into a common framework tied to negotiated outcomes, including the Global Stocktake. By establishing channels for coordination and collaboration, the Action Agenda can reinforce connections between government and non-state actors to drive greater climate action.

In addition to those mentioned above, a few highlights are particularly significant:

Cities, states and regions: COP30 saw tremendous momentum for the urban agenda. Over 14,000 cities, states and regions committed to advance climate solutions at the Local Leaders Forum in Rio ahead of COP30. 77 countries and the European Union have now committed to local-national climate collaboration through the CHAMP initiative. And185 cities joined the Beat the Heat initiative to tackle extreme heat.

Carbon accounting: Underpinning all sectors’ and companies’ climate progress is rigorous and transparent carbon accounting. The Action Agenda reaffirms that the partnership between Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the foundation of the global carbon-accounting system.

Bioeconomy challenge: Launched by Brazil and several partners, the initiative aims to scale sustainable nature-based investment by 2028 through a focus on five priority areas: forests, regenerative agriculture and restoration, sociobioeconomy, financing innovation, and bio-industrialization.

Energy: South Korea, the seventh-largest coal producer, committed to phase out coal by 2040. Alongside Bahrain, it also joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance. Utilities stepped up, too: members of the Utilities for Net Zero Alliance (UNEZA) announced they will increase annual investments in the energy transition to nearly $150 billion, with a major focus on grids and storage. And the global coalition Mission Efficiency launched a ""Plan to Accelerate Doubling Energy Efficiency (PAS),"" a much-needed roadmap aimed at achieving the COP28 goal to double energy efficiency by 2030.

By unifying more than 480 initiatives into 117 concrete “Plans to Accelerate Solutions,” the Action Agenda can help turn pledges into reality. It can also serve as critical support for the new Global Implementation Accelerator.

Picking Up the Pace of Change

It’s easy to be discouraged by the negative news coming out of COP30 and the climate space writ large. But beneath the headlines, progress is happening. Clean energy and electrified transport are growing at rates that were unimaginable a decade ago. Countries investing in a green transition are reaping the benefits, from new jobs and growing economies to better energy access and cleaner air.

A big question remains whether the Brazilian Presidency’s promise to deliver fossil fuel and deforestation roadmaps in the next year can bear fruit and have real impact. It is in the interest of those who want to see a just transition for it to do so. Meanwhile, countries must prove they can deliver their new climate plans, leveraging economy-wide policy shifts and finance mobilization to turn ambition into real action.

Whatever the twists and turns of climate negotiations, the economic transition is underway. The question is, how fast it will be and who will benefit? Now is the time for all actors to pick up the pace and drive towards a just transition.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-11/cop30-entrance_0.jpg?VersionId=b28gKb0.UWASNHxO24xErewA8QQaxOmC&h=4f71ec2a&itok=2dUldQ1g,N,,2025-11-26 01:58:57.472814

The rollback of Advanced Clean Fleets and less stringent but still ambitious federal programs have made the development of suitable zero-emission vehicles murkier, she said.","Recology is seeing increased uncertainty in the zero-emission vehicle market in the wake of regulatory rollbacks affecting heavy-duty fleets. But the hauler, among California’s largest, is still plotting a full transition.

Last month, Recology completed a fleet transition plan with the nonprofit Center for Transportation and the Environment after winning a competitive grant process backed by the C.H. Robinson Foundation, a philanthropic fund tied to the logistics and supply chain company of the same name.

The partners took a close look at Recology’s San Francisco fleet, which includes a mix of nearly 600 light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. It’s the largest fleet out of Recology’s total operations, which constitutes about 2,600 vehicles.

The plan is vehicle manufacturer agnostic and anticipates the incorporation of both battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. Julia Mangin, Recology’s director of sustainability and government affairs, said it helped clarify what opportunities and challenges the company should expect as it embarks on its transition.

“It demonstrated it’s certainly possible, but it’s going to take a lot of coordination and it’s not going to be inexpensive to do it,” Mangin said. “We’re hoping that further innovation helps with a lot of those challenges.”

Recology has historically been on the front line of companies looking to move away from more carbon-intensive fleets. The company achieved its goal to power 90% of its entire fleet with renewable or alternative fuels in 2022, and now has a goal to up that percentage to 95% by 2028.

That progress largely came through the use of renewable diesel and renewable natural gas. While Recology has piloted multiple battery-electric vehicles and today operates a few models, their deployment has been limited to date.

That’s in part due to pared back regulatory efforts to require a transition. California’s Advanced Clean Fleets regulation, which initially set hard deadlines by which many fleet operators in the state would have needed to transition to zero-emission vehicles, was curtailed by California’s Air Resources Board after the election of President Donald Trump in 2024. Trump’s administration has also worked to roll back requirements for vehicle manufacturers to produce zero-emission trucks this year.

Against the backdrop of those changes, CTE helped Recology better understand the availability of battery-electric and fuel cell vehicles to replace the range of models in its existing fleet, Mangin said. The center also provided a look at fueling infrastructure and other market developments.

The partners modeled what it would take to fully transition the fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2042, a deadline initially set by the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation. The transition plan calls for Recology to replace its smaller, lighter duty vehicles with battery electric models first before mixing in battery electric and fuel cell models for the hauler’s heavier vehicles over time.

Mangin said Recology would replace vehicles on a rolling basis as they reached the end of their useful life, which is usually about 10 years.

The plan estimates Recology would need three megawatts of charging power alone for its San Francisco fleet, a significant amount of power at a time when other electrification needs are also on the rise. Mangin said the company has begun engaging with utilities about adding capacity, but noted they can sometimes adopt a “get in line” mentality.

“A lot of it is dependent on how tapped the grid already is in that area,” Mangin said. “We’re trying to get ahead of it.”

Waste haulers and vehicle manufacturers alike have been reluctant to support strict regulations requiring zero emission vehicle adoption. But Mangin said those parties will have to work together alongside utilities in order to facilitate a complete transition.

The rollback of Advanced Clean Fleets and less stringent but still ambitious federal programs have made the development of suitable zero-emission vehicles murkier, she said.

“If manufacturers aren’t pushing to meet those requirements, there is concern that market availability isn’t going to progress as quickly as we’d like and as we’d hope,” Mangin said.

She said Recology wanted to remain aligned with “the spirit of and intent of those regulations,” even if they are no longer in effect. Removing their mandate may also give Recology more flexibility to align with manufacturers. Instead of scrambling to meet a deadline, the hauler could be driven more by market development, vehicle replacement schedules and utility and infrastructure deployment, Mangin said.

Prospects for fuel cell vehicles also remain uncertain. Recology was the first waste company to pilot a hydrogen fuel cell refuse vehicle developed by Hyzon in partnership with New Way Trucks. But Hyzon announced it would shutter months after the pilot, and received shareholder approval to liquidate earlier this year.

Mangin said she remains hopeful that another company can step into the void left by Hyzon’s collapse. But the manufacturer’s troubles are emblematic of the central issue with a transition — the heavy-duty vehicles that can offer a 1-to-1 replacement for Recology’s existing fleet have not arrived, and may not for another five years or more, Recology and CTE found.

“At the end of the day, we can only make a transition happen if there are vehicles out there that meet our needs,” Mangin said. “It just shows that a lot of things have to fall into place for a transition of this size to be successful.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nqKQ6x7D-ZXBVuuz_lfZZqGASnDXUR7VlRxXhwZsnUg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9SRUNfSENfODUzNV9GX3Jzel8xNi05LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-26 03:58:32.582656

Citizens Energy outlines plan to supply Lebanon from Indianapolis water sources

Eagle Creek Reservoir, known for its beauty and natural resources, contains about 8 billion gallons of water, Citizens said. The utility currently withdraws about 10 million gallons a day; the program could raise that to 11 to 13 million gallons per day.

""The program as a whole includes a couple of different expansions to different intakes on sources, but it's also about being able to move the water around,” Ben Easley, a spokesperson for Citizens Energy Group, said.

Members of the Eagle Creek Park Advisory Committee said they first learned about a proposed pipe and plant expansion from people who live near Eagle Creek. It came after they got letters in the mail letting them know that their land would have pipelines going through it. While the additional volume Citizens says it will take is not a huge increase, council members worry it could still have major impacts on the ecosystem and the overall water supply.

""One of the biggest concerns that we have is clearly there is a plan that they are acting on, and decisions have been made, we don't know what that plan is,” Lou Ann Baker with the Eagle Creek Park Advisory Committee said.

""We fear that dramatic changes to the withdraw or influx of water here will have an impact on the ecosystem,” Martin Risch, a member of the Eagle Creek Park Advisory Committee and a retired hydrologist, said.

One unanswered question is where the 25 million gallons of water will go each day. State Sen. J.D. Ford, who represents the area at the Statehouse, said he hopes Citizens Energy or Lebanon Utilities will be more transparent.

""We can generate electricity, but we can't really generate water, right?” Sen. Ford said. “This is a precious commodity. It's a valuable resource, and we need to be strategic about that. ""

Residents said they hope Citizens Energy Group will hold a town hall to discuss how the expansion will affect the community and the regional water supply. Sen.

By SBE Council at 25 November, 2025, 1:25 pm

by Raymond J. Keating –

Even while facing challenges and uncertainties, the resiliency of U.S. entrepreneurs, businesses and workers is something that all Americans should be grateful for this Thanksgiving, and throughout the rest of the year.

Consider energy production. During the first 25 years of this century, few industries have experienced such wild risks and uncertainties when it comes to public policies – such as swinging between formidable regulatory hostility to more friendly regulatory measures; between tax increases and tax relief; and between free trade and increased costs from protectionism. Nonetheless, the industry has been resilient and pushed forward with innovation, investment and production.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently served up data making clear the ongoing strength of U.S. energy production.

For example, it recently reported that Alaska crude oil production is expected to increase notably: “After decades of decline, we expect a 13% (55,000 b/d) increase in Alaska oil production, the largest annual increase since the 1980s.” Investments in two major projects on Alaska’s North Slope – the Nuna project and the Pikka Phase 1 project – were identified as the sources for this turnaround.

In addition, the U.S. lead in natural gas production was highlighted, with the EIA pointing out that the U.S. “has been the world’s largest producer of natural gas since 2009.” In fact, the U.S. produced “75% more than the world’s second-largest natural gas producer, Russia, in 2023.” And three U.S. regions rank “among the top 10 natural gas-producing areas in the world when ranked independently against other natural gas-producing countries” – the Appalachia region, in the northeastern United States; the Permian region, in Texas and New Mexico; and the Haynesville region, in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. (See the following chart from the EIA.)

As SBE Council has noted before, it’s critical to keep in mind that the U.S. energy sector is all about small business. America’s energy sectors are overwhelmingly populated by small businesses – often the drivers of innovation – as noted in the following breakdowns of employer firms by firm size in various sectors:

It’s essential for all Americans, including our elected officials, to understand the importance of U.S. energy production. After all, energy production is foundational to all other industries, from heating and cooling homes to personal and commercial transportation to investments and expansion of our high-tech economy, including AI, and beyond.

Thankfully, policies have moved in a direction that is supportive of America’s energy sector, which will help make our energy supply more abundant and affordable.

It would make sense for elected officials to come together in a bipartisan manner in support of an agenda that’s foundational to energy investment and innovation, especially low taxes; light, consistent regulation; and free trade.",https://sbecouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/American-energy-e1564575158953.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 22:58:49.886925

Saline Township residents speak out over proposed data center

He and his wife, Tammi, said they moved to the countryside for peace and quiet. But they say that way of life is under threat by the proposed data center.

A developer wants to build the structure on nearby farmland. In a perfect world, the Bruneaus said the idea would just go away.

Their concerns range from a drop in property values, to noise and ground pollution. Another concern is the potential impact on their energy bill.

“At the very least, we need to have guarantees from DTE that this is not going to affect our bills five, 10 years down the line,” Tammi Bruneau said.

DTE is asking the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast track the approval process to provide power to the proposed data center.

But Tuesday morning, environmental experts and state officials including Michigan's attorney general came together to demand more transparency.

“We can regulate these entities responsibly and therefore, we have an obligation to do so, but we can’t claim responsibility and fair regulation if we’re starting out with all these shortcuts,” Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, said.

As Nessel explained, DTE filed what’s known as an ex parte application with the MPSC. Basically, an ex parte application means no one can challenge what DTE is seeking to do.

Nessel said DTE claims the application should be granted because no one will be impacted by rate hikes. It’s a notion some residents 7 News Detroit talked to don’t believe.

“My concern is that it appears as though the commission is under extraordinary political and industry pressure to ram through these special contracts for DTE without any public discovery, despite the fact that all our other organizations have been sounding the alarm for nearly a month that these massive contracts have the potential to shape energy policy for decades to come,” Nessel said.

7 News Detroit reached out to the MPSC. The commission, which is now going to host a virtual public hearing next Wednesday, Dec. 3, declined to comment.

DTE released the following statement:",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39d8498/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1269x666+0+22/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F96%2Fcc7623964461ab28bf6a8d369901%2Fscreenshot-2025-11-25-at-8-56-00-pm.png,N,,2025-11-25 23:57:52.630631

Those delays flow directly into freight transportation costs, which ultimately show up in household budgets.
Today, long-distance rail shipments must often pass across multiple carriers, adding interchange delays, extra handling and fragmented visibility.
A unified rail network, if properly regulated and responsibly executed, can help get us there.","The U.S. transportation system is being pushed beyond the limits of what it was built to handle. Freight volumes continue climbing, supply chains are more time-sensitive, and our roads — long the backbone of domestic commerce—are increasingly defined by congestion and delay.

Anyone who driving the New Jersey Turnpike, the D.C. Beltway, I-40 across Tennessee, or California’s I-405 has experienced it: Occupying every lane are heavy 18-wheelers and delivery trucks, slow-motion rolling blockades as two tractor-trailers crawl side-by-side for miles. It’s a daily reminder that the highway network is saturated, and clever policies such as limiting truck traffic during peak hours, while helpful on the margins, cannot resolve a structural capacity problem.

The economic consequences are real. According to the 2025 Urban Mobility Report from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, Americans lost an average of 63 hours to traffic delays in 2024, with a national cost exceeding $269 billion. Those delays flow directly into freight transportation costs, which ultimately show up in household budgets. Whether it appears in the prices of groceries, medicine, building materials or manufactured goods, congestion is a hidden tax on consumers.

The core funding mechanism for our highways has also eroded. The Congressional Research Service reports that federal gasoline and diesel taxes have lost roughly 73% of their purchasing power since 1993. That loss has compounded deferred maintenance and contributed to growing pressure on the Highway Trust Fund. Public dollars are stretched thin at the same moment that system demands are rising.

I have seen these pressures from multiple vantage points: as a federal regulator, as someone who has run a motor carrier, and as an adviser on infrastructure strategy. Fragmented freight networks, unpredictable travel times and siloed infrastructure investment all translate into higher costs and reduced national competitiveness. Meeting today’s challenges requires more than simply widening roads. It demands smarter traffic management, targeted new capacity, expanded P3 delivery models, improved freight logistic, and more efficient ways to move long-haul freight.

One option now before regulators could help address part of this equation: the proposed combination of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. If approved, the deal would create the nation’s first single-system, truly coast-to-coast freight railroad, spanning more than 50,000 route-miles across 43 states and reaching roughly 100 ports, according to independent reporting from Reuters.

Today, long-distance rail shipments must often pass across multiple carriers, adding interchange delays, extra handling and fragmented visibility. A unified network could eliminate many of those friction points, cutting days off cross-country runs, improving reliability and offering shippers a seamless experience more comparable to trucking—without drawing on taxpayer funds. Shifting even a portion of the heaviest freight back to rail would also reduce highway wear, ease the driver-shortage burden and lower emissions and crash exposure per ton-mile.

Nevertheless, this is not an argument for rail at the expense of trucking. Trucks remain indispensable for first- and last-mile delivery and for much of America’s freight. A healthier, more balanced system benefits both modes. And I understand the concerns of those who lived through past mergers that produced service slowdowns, job losse, or consolidation of local rail facilities. Those concerns are not hypothetical.

Critics also raise real competitive issues: the risk of reduced choice for captive shippers, potential rate pressure and the possibility that a single mega-network could amplify service disruptions. Short line railroads worry about fair access. Communities worry about job impacts. Labor wants assurance that service improvements are not achieved through workforce cuts that compromise safety.

These issues deserve a direct response. The Surface Transportation Board should condition any approval on enforceable service quality metrics, strong gateway protections, guaranteed short line interchange access, transparent pricing and clear penalties for service failures. These guardrails are essential, not optional, to ensure competition is preserved and shippers benefit from the efficiencies promised.

If those protections are in place, the merger represents a rare opportunity: a substantial infusion of private capital into the backbone of the U.S. freight system at a moment when public resources cannot fully keep pace. Railroads have privately owned infrastructure, and strategic private investment relieves pressure on taxpayer-funded roads while strengthening national supply chain resilience.

Ultimately, the goal is not to pick winners. It is to let the market move freight on the mode best suited to the job, freeing highways for the trips that truly require them, improving safety and ensuring U.S. goods can move at the speed demanded by a competitive global economy. A unified rail network, if properly regulated and responsibly executed, can help get us there.",https://www.hudson.org/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/2025-11/GettyImages-2227594838.jpg?h=de1f980b&itok=4mzLPC4T,N,,2025-11-26 04:59:27.441860

“Even if the EPA wants to allow coal power plants to further delay cleaning up their coal ash ponds, that is a clear violation of the law,” said Mychal Ozaeta, Earthjustice senior attorney.
“The courts have ruled that they cannot continue to put toxic coal ash into holding ponds that are leaking toxic contaminants into groundwater.
The longer industry fails to take action to control its toxic coal ash, the more toxic waste enters our water, and the more difficult cleanup becomes.
“Coal power companies have been letting unlined coal ash ponds leak toxic pollutants into nearby water in violation of the law for more than a decade,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel at Earthjustice.","—

Today the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposal to further delay closure deadlines for coal ash ponds at 11coal power plants for three years and allow these power plants to apply to continue operating past their planned retirement dates. All of these unlined coal ash ponds are known to be leaking toxic pollutants such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and radium into surrounding groundwater.

The EPA’s proposed revisions would allow these 11 coal power plants to burn coal until October 2031 and continue to dump toxic coal ash into unlined ponds, most of which contain more than a million cubic yards of toxic waste held back by decades-old earthen or ash berms.

“Even if the EPA wants to allow coal power plants to further delay cleaning up their coal ash ponds, that is a clear violation of the law,” said Mychal Ozaeta, Earthjustice senior attorney. “The courts have ruled that they cannot continue to put toxic coal ash into holding ponds that are leaking toxic contaminants into groundwater. None of these power plants are able to qualify for these extensions, regardless of what the EPA says.”

Federal safeguards in place since 2015 (the Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule) required all unlined coal ash ponds to cease receiving waste by April 11, 2021 and begin closure and cleanup of the toxic pollution. Five years ago, these 11 power plants applied for exemptions to closure requirements under a rule established during the first Trump Administration for coal power plants that were set to retire by October 2028 (Part A extensions 40 CFR 257.103(f)(1) and (2)). To qualify, they had to demonstrate, among other things, that no alternative ash disposal capacity was available; potential risks to human health and the environment from the coal ash pond are mitigated; and the facility is in compliance with all other CCR Rule safeguards, including the requirement to clean up contaminated groundwater.

The EPA has never approved any power plant’s application for this extension, but the filing of these applications allows the plants to continue dumping until the extension date is reached or an EPA determination is issued. If approved, the proposal issued today by the EPA would allow the continued operation of unlined coal ash ponds for at least an additional 13 years after a D.C. Circuit decision in 2018 requiring their closure.

The longer industry fails to take action to control its toxic coal ash, the more toxic waste enters our water, and the more difficult cleanup becomes.

“Coal power companies have been letting unlined coal ash ponds leak toxic pollutants into nearby water in violation of the law for more than a decade,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel at Earthjustice. “In 2023, the EPA designated coal ash a national enforcement priority, but now this EPA is asking coal power companies how long they would like to continue dumping toxic coal ash into dangerous unlined ponds.”

Background

Earthjustice represents communities across the U.S. that have fought for years to hold coal-fired power plant operators responsible for their reckless disposal and storage of coal ash.

An Earthjustice lawsuit compelled the EPA to adopt its first-ever safeguards to protect people from toxic coal ash in 2015, but the rule excluded landfills and waste piles that stopped receiving coal ash before the rule went into effect. As a result of our litigation, the Legacy Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Surface Impoundment Rule extended federal monitoring and cleanup requirements to hundreds of older coal ash landfills and ponds across the country. In July of 2025, Trump’s EPA announced that it intends to extend compliance deadlines for monitoring and cleaning up coal ash, effectively allowing coal plant owners to stall clean up beyond 2030, and will issue a new Legacy Coal Ash Rule in January of 2026.

Coal ash is a toxic mix of hazardous pollutants, metals, carcinogens, and neurotoxins, including arsenic, boron, cobalt, chromium, lead, lithium, mercury, molybdenum, radium, selenium, and other heavy metals. These have been linked to cancer, heart and thyroid disease, reproductive failure, and neurological harm.

This Clean Economy Works (CEW) analysis is part of E2’s ongoing monthly tracking of large-scale clean energy project announcements, cancellations, closures, and downsizes across the United States. This analysis monitors private-sector investment in clean energy manufacturing, generation, and grid infrastructure projects since federal energy tax credits were passed in August 2022. The tracking excludes projects that began, were proposed, sited, or in anyway began development prior to the IRA, as well as those funded entirely by federal sources or lacking specific geographic data. CEW measures key indicators including investment value, job creation or losses, project types (manufacturing, generation, research and development), and distribution by sector, state, and congressional district.

Since 2025, this analysis began to include all project cancellations, closures, and downsizings going back to August 2022 due to rising business uncertainty about the future of U.S. clean energy policy, culiminating in the rollback and restriction of energy tax credits included in the federal tax and spending bill passed in July 2025. E2’s methodology excludes temporary delays or ownership transfers that do not impact production capacity. E2’s tracking of cancelled and closed projects includes developments that may not have been counted as an announcement because they had been proposed, announced, broken ground, or opened prior to August 2022.

This dataset provides a comprehensive look at the evolving U.S. clean energy economy—highlighting the impact of federal policy changes, supply chain dynamics, and market shifts on America’s clean energy workforce and investment pipeline.

Overview

E2’s latest analysis finds that that companies canceled, closed or downsized nine major clean energy projects in October (including one disclosed on Sept. 30) that would have otherwise resulted in more than $4.4 billion in economic investments and an estimated 8,700 new jobs. During the same month, only one new project was announced, a battery storage operation in Pennsylvania.

Year-to-date through October 2025, companies have canceled, closed, or scaled back 51 large-scale clean energy projects, according to analysis by E2 of projects tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker. The cancelation of these projects represent the loss of nearly $28.8 billion in private investment in new factories and projects nationwide, nearly 30,000 new jobsthat were previously announced.

The findings emphasize the rising risk and uncertainty to the U.S. economy – and future energy supplies – as the overall trajectory of clean energy projects continues to slow sharply amid policy challenges and new federal roadblocks to clean energy development.

Cancellation Findings

Project cancellations and downsizing accelerated significantly through October, reflecting growing uncertainty in the clean energy sector and a sharp pullback from manufacturers that had previously committed major capital investments. The abandoned projects—including high-impact electric vehicle, battery, and solar factories and other projects—represent substantial economic losses to states, workers, and communities that had been preparing for long-term industrial growth.

Nine recent project abandonments and downsizes in October include the loss of more than $4.4 billionin investments and at least 8,700 previously announced jobs at major EV, battery and other clean energy related facotires in Mississippi, Tennessee, Michigan, and Ohio and elsewhere.

Nissan (MS)– 2,000 jobs lost; $500M abandoned (9/30)

Enchem (TN)– 190 jobs lost; $152.5M abandoned (10/1)

General Motors (OH)– 1,520 jobs lost; $760M abandoned (10/2)

GAF Energy (CA)– 138 jobs lost; R&D facility closed (10/15)

Gotion (MI)– 2,350 jobs lost; $2.36B abandoned (10/24)

GM (MI)downsizing – 1,200 jobs impacted; investment reduction not disclosed (10/29)

GM/LG Energy Solution (OH)downsizing – 550 jobs impacted; investment reduction not disclosed (10/29)

Xalt Energy (MI)– 550 jobs lost; $600M abandoned (10/31)

Dana (MI)– 200 jobs lost; $54.2M abandoned (10/21)

Fifty-one large-scale clean energy projectshave been canceled, closed, or downsized in 2025—more than any previous year since the IRA passed. These projects were expected to create 29,944 new jobs and included $28.77 billion in planned investments that are now lost.

Manufacturing facilitiesaccount for nearly all losses—accounting for 45 of the 51 projects abandoned in 2025 and over 29,000 jobs and $24.2 billion in investment lost.

EV and battery/storage projects continue to drive the majority of cancellations:24 EV projects and 25 battery/storage projects have been abandoned since 2025

Republican congressional districtshave experienced the greatest economic fallout: 37 canceled projects, 21,916 lost jobs, and $16.9 billion in abandoned investments compared with 24 projects, 13,248 jobs, and $9.9 billion in lost investment in Democratic-held districts, and 13 projects, 4,378 jobs, and $4.6 billion in lost investment where the specific district is yet to be the determined.

Announcement Findings

Just a single new clean energy project announcement was made in October, the lowest number since E2 began tracking announcements in August 2022:

Eos Energy Storage (PA)– Battery/storage manufacturing plant expected to create 1,000 jobs and result in $352.9 million in investments.

Since E2 began tracking projects in August 2022, companies have announced a total of 417 major clean energy manufacturing, generation, and grid projectsacross 42 states and Puerto Rico. These announced projects represent 124,241 planned jobs and about $132.33 billion in total investment.

Context and Implications

The latest CEW data shows that the U.S. clean energy economy is entering a period of instability driven largely by shifting federal policies, new federal roadblocks to clean energy development and the rollback of clean energy tax incentives. The acceleration of cancellations in October and throughout 2025 signals that this momentum is increasingly fragile.

The implications extend beyond the clean energy sector: these projects represent some of the largest new manufacturing investments in decades, often located in rural or historically industrial communities. As policy instability increases, so does the risk that these regions will not only lose out on once-in-a-generation opportunities, but be able ever to regain the ground lost.

The stakes are high. The trajectory of cancellations this year is an early warning indicator: Without durable policy commitment, the U.S. could forfeit both the economic and strategic benefits of global leadership in the energy sector.

About this Analysis

Announcements

Projects that began development, were proposed, or applied for local and state approval before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are not included. This analysis also does not include investments in which the federal government has provided financial resources for the complete project, lease sales, projects in which an announcement was made but lacked specific geographic information, etc. Details on projects came from news reports on new and related projects; press releases from companies announcing new developments; and government announcements.

Cancellations, Closures, Downsizes

This tracking includes all projects, plants, operations, or expansions that were cancelled or closed since passage of the IRA in August 2022. This does not include announced layoffs that are not associated with a project downsizing unless there is a stated decease in production output. This list also does not include the transfer of project ownership, if production will continue under the new ownership, power purchasing agreements, or other similar type of announcements. Project delays or idling of facilities are not included unless there in an announced decrease in production or investment or unless the project will need to be restarted to proceed in the future.

Once published in the Federal Register, the proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days.","Key Points

The U.S. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a joint proposal updating the definition of “Waters of the United States,” which will be open for public comment after its official publishing in the Federal Register.

The proposed rule would narrow the definition of Waters of the United States and include exclusions for determining whether waters and wetlands are subject to permitting under the federal Clean Water Act.

While viewed as a significant deregulation that could impact sensitive environments throughout the United States, the proposed rule’s deregulatory impact in California would be more limited, given California’s broader regulation of Waters of the State under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.

On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers together announced a proposed rule updating the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS), in another effort to align with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision.

As we previously discussed, the WOTUS rule was revised twice under the Biden administration, once in March 2023 to update the definition prior to the Sackett decision, and again in August 2023 to conform to Sackett by eliminating the “significant nexus” test that the decision invalidated.

This most recent revision defines key terms for determining which waters are subject to the Clean Water Act, such as “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary.” It also addresses key exclusions by adding an exclusion for groundwater and clarifying pre-existing exclusions for ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems. The EPA published a fact sheet on its website that covers the most notable of these proposed changes.

This proposed rule’s effect, if finalized, will have less of a deregulatory effect in California than in other states, however, given California’s expanded regulation of “Waters of the State” through the Porter-Cologne Act. The Porter-Cologne Act leaves few, if any, California waters unregulated. If anything, this narrowing of the scope of WOTUS may increase regulatory complexity in California by requiring, in some instances, that regulated entities obtain a Waste Discharge Requirements permit under the Porter-Cologne Act rather than a general permit available under the Clean Water Act. Individual permits under the Porter-Cologne Act may lead to a more burdensome review process compared to permitting under sections 404 & 401 of the federal Clean Water Act. Under those provisions of the Clean Water Act, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards’ review and permitting process is more streamlined.

Once published in the Federal Register, the proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days. The EPA’s pre-publication notice advises that the rule will appear on the Government Printing Office’s govinfo website and on Regulations.gov in Docket No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

The EPA is accepting public comments on its more limited federal water protections through Jan. 5th.","A large portion of wetlands in the Mountain West could lose federal protections under a new proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But a couple of states in the region are working to build their own safeguards.

On Nov. 17, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and the Army Corps of Engineers announced a proposal for a narrowed definition of “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS), the designation that determines which rivers, streams and wetlands qualify for protection under the Clean Water Act.

Under the proposal, wetlands would be excluded unless they are connected to other protected waters and hold surface water for part of the year. The definition also removes protections for interstate waters “to make clear that such waters no longer gain jurisdiction by simply crossing state lines.”

Industry groups praised the proposal for cutting red tape.

“Today's WOTUS announcement finally acknowledges that the federal government should work to protect lakes, rivers and oceans, rather than regulating ditches and ponds on family farms and ranches,” said Mary-Thomas Hart, chief counsel for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, in a statement.

The EPA said the changes align with a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In Sackett v. EPA, an Idaho couple who built a house near a lake prevailed when the Court ruled that the agency had improperly labeled their property a protected wetland.

But Stu Gillespie, a staff attorney for Earthjustice in Denver, said the current proposal would go beyond what the Sackett ruling required.

“It would essentially limit jurisdiction to just the main navigable rivers, their tributaries and a couple wetlands, if that,” he said. “It would be a massive rollback of Clean Water Act protections that no one has even contemplated until now.”

Gillespie said the impacts would be severe for critical wetlands and streams in the arid West, many of which are seasonal or fed by groundwater.

“A lot of our water bodies are intermittent, or even ephemeral, and you don't always have that continuous [surface] connection,” he said.

According to an EPA analysis, only an estimated 3% of wetlands in Colorado have surface water part of the year. The agency has not responded to clarify the impacts of the proposal.

States create their own backstops

Two Mountain West states—New Mexico and Colorado—are developing their own systems to protect waters that have lost federal oversight.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the “first-in-the-nation” bipartisan law last year to protect the state’s surface waters, saying it would fill the regulatory gap left by the Sackett decision. New Mexico passed a similar bill this year.

Colorado’s law established a new permitting program within the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. It will regulate the removal of sediment from, or filling in, streams, rivers and wetlands, including waters no longer protected under the Clean Water Act.

A state commission is now hammering out the details through rulemaking. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 8-10, and a committee has until the end of the year to finalize the rules.

Gillespie, who is representing environmental and community groups in the rulemaking process, said the Water Quality Control Commission’s current proposal is promising but leaves some areas vulnerable.

“There are a lot of interests out there, particularly industry groups, that are trying to weaken the regulation,” he said. “Some of them are trying to take a sledgehammer to it to really undermine the program.”

Environmental groups are particularly concerned that wetlands near ditches or canals won’t be covered. That exclusion, they estimate in prehearing documents, would leave roughly 500,000 acres of the state’s wetlands unprotected.

On the other hand, some industry groups worry the commission may expand the program beyond what they believe the legislature intended.

“We want to see a program that adheres as closely as possible to the statutory framework agreed upon, which really represents the compromise of the vast range of water users,” said Adam Eckman, the President and CEO of the Colorado Mining Association.

He disagrees with environmental groups who want projects to undergo a “public interest” review, weighing the benefits and harms of a project, before receiving permits. Such reviews would be nebulous and beyond the scope of the program, he said.which he said would be nebulous and open-ended.

“Since 2021, the United States has experienced an unprecedented clean energy manufacturing boom, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to communities across the country,” according to the report.","It’s been doom and gloom galore for the EV sector of late.

Amid slower demand and federal policy changes deprioritizing electrification, the industry is shedding jobs and delaying or canceling projects. In fact, 2025 has seen more clean energy manufacturing investments canceled than announced—a stark change from just a few years ago, when the US was on the cusp of an EV and battery manufacturing boom.

But some industry analysts say that despite some very real pain in the short term, the future remains bright for zero-emissions vehicles. In the meantime, buckle up for a bumpy ride.

Loren McDonald, CEO and chief analyst at Chargeonomics, compared today’s EV market to the early days of cellular technology.

“What history has told us now is we were actually in the BlackBerry phase, and still are. The product is good, but it’s not compelling enough for average consumers,” he said. “We haven’t actually reached the phase with the product that’s more like the iPhone, where everybody goes, ‘Oh my God, I need to have an EV, it’s so much better than my gas car.’”

Pump the brakes

In October, General Motors said it planned to indefinitely lay off 1,750 workers and temporarily lay off another 1,670 as it trims EV and battery production at plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. Part of the plan includes temporarily idling GM’s Factory Zero plant in Detroit, which produces multiple EVs, and then resuming production with only one shift, according to InsideEVs. The production pause at two EV battery plants is slated to last until mid-2026.

“In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said. “Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our US manufacturing footprint.”

EV maker Rivian also recently announced 600 job cuts, with CEO RJ Scaringe reportedly telling employees: “With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”

And as The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, Ford is considering cutting its electric F-150 Lightning amid weak sales and mounting losses in its EV business. The WSJ also noted Stellantis’s canceled plans for an electric version of its full-size Ram pickup truck earlier this year and sluggish sales of Tesla’s Cybertruck.

Freudenberg e-Power Systems recently announced the closure of two EV battery plants in Michigan, resulting in 324 layoffs, The Hill reported; company leaders cited “the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America.”

Rest of World published an analysis in September reporting that more than 30,000 workers had lost their jobs at EV manufacturers “and related industries worldwide over the past year” amid trade policy changes, weaker growth, geopolitical tensions, higher interest rates, and a more competitive market.

Research firm Atlas Public Policy, in partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund, recently tallied total cancellations representing nearly $21 billion in investments in clean energy manufacturing in the first three quarters of 2025. Battery projects have taken the biggest hit: 11% of announced projects were scrapped, mostly this year.

One bright spot: The authors noted that about four-fifths of active investments were under construction or operational, and Q3 had net positive investments. Since 2000, the clean energy manufacturing sector has drawn nearly $250 billion in investments, most announced since mid-2021, during Joe Biden’s presidency.

“Since 2021, the United States has experienced an unprecedented clean energy manufacturing boom, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to communities across the country,” according to the report. “However, the first nine months of 2025 have seen a stark change. Trump administration policies and cuts to clean energy tax credits have slowed growth considerably and threatened progress.”

The pullback comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill, which set Sept. 30 as the expiration date for federal tax credits on certain EV purchases. Atlas analysts pointed to “funding cuts and policy shifts” as the driving forces behind “cancellations of $20.8 billion and nearly 27,300 anticipated manufacturing jobs in 2025 alone.”

“When we think about the cancellations, it’s numbers for sure, but also this has a negative impact on communities that were anticipating preparing for economic opportunities from these clean energy projects, whether it was through the anticipated jobs themselves, maybe workforce development programs that the company and the community had agreed to establish,” Matthew Vining, a policy analyst at Atlas, told us.

Idling

If this all sounds bleak for the prospect of carbon-free transportation, some industry analysts view it as a short-term correction. What’s really happening, McDonald contended, is more complicated than just the fallout of tax credits going away. He sees the recent pullback as a result of how legacy automakers approached the launch of their first-generation EVs.

“[The end of the tax credits is] a real thing, but the automakers are using it as an excuse to pull back,” he said. “It allows them to take a deep breath and go, ‘Phew, now we can focus on selling those $80,000 fully loaded gas Chevy Tahoes and things like that,’ while they actually work on building their generation two, generation three EV models that are truly compelling.”

In some cases, legacy automakers converted existing internal combustion engine vehicles to electric rather than developing new platforms from the ground up. Many are now working on next-gen EVs built on new platforms. Ford, for example, is introducing an entirely new manufacturing process to support production of a smaller, more affordable electric truck.

GM, meantime, is preparing to relaunch the mass market-oriented Chevy Bolt, and Rivian is slated to debut its more-affordable R2 lineup next year, among other upcoming launches.

As McDonald sees it, the US’s first EV phase was defined by products that didn’t match what mainstream consumers were looking for. Automakers found some success, to be sure—Rivian’s R1S in the luxury segment, for example. And half of the Cadillac brand’s sales are now electric.

But the next EV era, McDonald said, must feature mass-market EVs with lower price tags and better software experiences.

“If you get the car right, and it’s a fit with the market, and you price it correctly, there’s solid demand and market for it,” McDonald said. “We just don’t have enough of those vehicles yet. And that’s the problem—not EVs.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-26 01:59:22.536362

A partisan battle is shaping up as part of the massive highway-policy bill that is rewritten every few years. The last cycle started in 2021 with the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law under former President Joe Biden, which dedicated billions of dollars for EVs and their charging networks. That cycle is ending with the Trump administration trying (but not quite succeeding) to prevent those dollars from being spent.

Now, lawmakers are starting to write a new surface transportation reauthorization bill they hope to enact by next October. And congressional Democrats are signaling they won’t play ball if EVs aren’t a priority — even if it’s hard to imagine the Trump White House suddenly embracing battery-powered cars.

In a letter to committee heads, the signers said the bill won’t move without “critical investments in zero-emission vehicles and associated charging and fueling infrastructure.”

They have some leverage. The transportation bill requires 60 votes in the Senate, meaning that it won’t move without some Democratic support.

Leading the effort are Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.). Both sit on the committees that produce major portions of the bill — Padilla on the Senate’s Environment and Public Works and Davids on the House’s Transportation and Infrastructure.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has spent years railing against Biden-era EV policies, and this year, he stripped away the industry’s consumer tax credits. Then again, he bought a Tesla.

Running out of road?

A lot of the debate comes down to infrastructure: who defines it, and who pays for it.

EV advocates argue that chargers have become basic transportation infrastructure, like concrete and steel. They point out that the last transportation bill was part of the bipartisan infrastructure law and that many EV-related dollars flowed through traditional funding channels.

“It’s clear that this is infrastructure,” said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group for EV-related companies.

Republicans have a counterargument. House Transportation and Infrastructure Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.)’s proposal is not to fund EVs but to assess fees on people who drive them.

An annual fee of $250 on EVs and $100 on hybrids, he argued earlier this month, is necessary to replenish the perpetually underfunded Highway Trust Fund. That fund pays for highway and transit improvements and is sourced from excise taxes on every gallon of gasoline and diesel sold.

“If you’re using that infrastructure, then you should be paying for it,” Graves said.

EV lobbyists say that fee is too high, citing estimates that the average traditional-car driver pays only $82 per year into the fund. Pegging the EV fee so high would be unfair and discourage EV adoption that is needed to reduce climate-warming emissions, said Bridget Sanderson, the head of the Coalition Helping America Rebuild and Go Electric, an umbrella group for EV advocates.

This infrastructure standoff raises the prospect of a horse trade: a fee on electric vehicle drivers in exchange for federal help to boost the EV ecosystem in its weak spots.

That is not outside of the realm of possibility,” Sanderson said.

Rural Michiganders face big bills after disaster-aid denial

Electric utility customers in rural northern Michigan could be on the hook for tens of millions of dollars after the Trump administration denied disaster aid following an ice storm in March, Thomas Frank writes.

The president so far has twice refused to reimburse two utilities for rebuilding the grid after the storms. They documented over $90 million in damage, nearly five times the threshold for federal aid.

“This is something nobody asked for. Our members did not want this ice storm,” said Allan Berg, the CEO of Presque Isle Electric & Gas, known as PIE&G, in northeastern Michigan. “FEMA is a federal program designed to ensure when large natural disasters occur, they can come and make the playing field level.”

No NEPA for offshore plans, Interior says

The Interior Department won’t conduct an environmental analysis it has used for decades in its five-year plan for offshore drilling, Ian M. Stevenson writes.

Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited two court cases last week when it called review under the National Environmental Policy Act “discretionary” in its leasing proposal released last week. The proposal for drilling from 2026 to 2031 called for including new areas off California, in the High Arctic and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Per BLM, the court rulings mean approval of a five-year plan “does not constitute an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources and that, in the context of BOEM’s multiple stage leasing program, the obligation to fully comply with NEPA does not mature until the lease sale stage.”

An analysis by the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality shows that levels of criteria air pollutants from vehicles would also significantly increase in Mecklenburg County.
Even marginal upticks in criteria pollution could harm the county and its residents because it has little leeway in complying with air quality standards.
“These challenges could hinder the state’s ability to maintain compliance with health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards while supporting economic development,” Abraczinskas said.
The EPA asserted in its proposal that repealing greenhouse gas emission regulations would not change existing standards for criteria pollutants.","There was a time when the air pollution in Charlotte, North Carolina, was so bad that the 871-foot Bank of America Corporate Center, the city’s tallest building, topped by an ornate metal crown, wore a veil of smog.

It took years, but after North Carolina enacted more stringent regulations, the air in Charlotte, although far from pristine, has finally improved.

That hard-won accomplishment is now threatened by the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to repeal regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, the primary drivers of global climate change.

In July, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the agency’s intention to rescind the 2009 determination, known as the endangerment finding, that greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide and methane, harm human health and the environment. Although the EPA’s repeal would be limited to greenhouse gas regulations, it would have the effect of automatically eliminating many other emissions standards for cars and trucks.

An analysis by the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality shows that levels of criteria air pollutants from vehicles would also significantly increase in Mecklenburg County. The EPA defines criteria pollutants as ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and very fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, which is smaller than the width of a human hair and can enter not just the lungs but also the bloodstream.

Even marginal upticks in criteria pollution could harm the county and its residents because it has little leeway in complying with air quality standards.

Mike Abraczinskas, director of the N.C. Division of Air Quality, told the Environmental Management Commission earlier this month that a state analysis showed if greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks are eliminated, on-road emissions of four pollutants—nitrogen oxide, PM 2.5, sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds—in Mecklenburg County would increase by a total of 470 tons by 2035.

By 2050, annual emissions would increase by 940 tons.

The division chose Mecklenburg County for its analysis because the area is close to exceeding federal standards on ozone and PM 2.5, the latter of which is scientifically linked to heart and respiratory illness, premature birth and dementia.

“These challenges could hinder the state’s ability to maintain compliance with health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards while supporting economic development,” Abraczinskas said.

The EPA asserted in its proposal that repealing greenhouse gas emission regulations would not change existing standards for criteria pollutants. However, the EPA acknowledged in its proposal that the repeal “could marginally impact emissions of criteria pollutants and air toxics,” but it would not have a “material adverse impact on the health of individuals with respect to non-GHG air pollutants, including on children.

Asked for further detail on the impacts of repealing the endangerment finding, an EPA spokesperson said: “Clearly you have not looked at our website. We refer you to our website where you can find the proposed rule, the draft regulatory impact analysis, and many more resources on the proposed rule.”

DEQ sent a 28-page letter to the EPA during the public comment period in September on repeal of the endangerment finding, urging the agency to withdraw the repeal. DEQ cited the state’s vulnerability to hurricanes and wildfires, which are becoming more intense because of climate change. The rollbacks would also undermine some of North Carolina’s work to achieve cleaner air.

“We are very concerned that the EPA’s proposed action will have serious impacts on North Carolina’s plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining compliance with national ambient air quality standards,” Abraczinskas wrote.

The EPA’s timing is particularly egregious, said Jeffrey Robbins, executive director of the nonprofit group CleanAIRE NC, based in Charlotte.

Mecklenburg County plans to widen Interstate 77, the primary north-south artery through Charlotte. This would “funnel more heavy vehicle traffic directly through historically Black neighborhoods,” Robbins said. “Families in these communities will breathe this exhaust every day—in their homes, in their schools, in their places of work. Removing emissions safeguards precisely when traffic volume is increasing is an unacceptable act of environmental injustice.”

Aided by a rainy June and July, Mecklenburg County recorded zero days of exceeding the federal ozone standard this year, according to a presentation on Monday by the county’s Air Quality Commission.

But with an average of 68 parts per billion, the county remained just under the wire to comply with health-based standards for ozone of 70 parts per billion, as measured over the last three years.

Megan Green, the county’s program manager for mobile sources—cars and trucks—told the Air Quality Commission that if the EPA successfully repeals the standards, local and state governments would have to “look for other emission reduction strategies that would bring us into compliance.”

Individuals, too, could reduce their exposure to pollutants, according to Robbins of CleanAIRE NC, by combining separate errands into a single trip, using public transit, and walking or biking for short trips. Turn off the car, for example, while idling in a drive-thru or in a school pickup line.

“We cannot afford to gamble with the health and well-being of our families and communities by ending standards that have so effectively reduced dangerous pollution,” Robbins said.

The EPA has not set a date for the repeal, and first must review all 27,000 public comments it received on the proposal.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Charlotte-1024x663.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:59:30.789831

Duke’s other subsidiary, Duke Energy Progress, covers much of eastern North Carolina and has a separate rate proposal.
How Duke’s profit is regulated Duke Energy does not set its own profit margin.
The company says this rate request helps recover past investments and pay for the next round of grid improvements.","GREENSBORO, N.C. — Duke Energy, the utility serving most of the Triad, has filed a proposal that could raise customer power bills beginning in 2027. The request is the first step in a lengthy regulatory process, and nothing changes for customers right now.

The company’s filing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission outlines a two-year rate increase totaling about 15%. For most households in the Triad, the proposal would increase monthly bills in two phases: roughly 10% to 11% in 2027, followed by another 3% to 4% in 2028.

Why this is only the beginning

When Duke files a rate case, the Utilities Commission reviews the request, holds hearings, takes public comment, and evaluates each project tied to the increase. That process typically takes seven to ten months. In past cases, regulators have often reduced parts of the utility’s original request before approving a final amount.

Who this affects in the Triad

Duke Energy Carolinas serves nearly all of the Piedmont Triad, including Guilford, Forsyth, Alamance, Davidson, Randolph, Rockingham, and Stokes counties. Duke’s other subsidiary, Duke Energy Progress, covers much of eastern North Carolina and has a separate rate proposal.

Why Duke says it needs the increase

According to Duke, the money would go toward replacing aging power lines, strengthening the grid during storms, installing more battery storage, and keeping up with North Carolina’s rapid population growth. The company also emphasized that data centers are not driving the increase. Duke says those large facilities pay the full cost of connecting to the grid and, because they use so much power consistently, they can actually help spread out system costs.

How Duke’s profit is regulated

Duke Energy does not set its own profit margin. As a regulated monopoly, the company’s earnings are capped by the state. The Utilities Commission sets an overall allowed rate of return, usually around 9% to 10%, on the equipment and infrastructure Duke Energy has already built. Duke only earns that return if customer rates cover the cost of those projects.

The company says this rate request helps recover past investments and pay for the next round of grid improvements.

What happens next

Public hearings on the proposal are expected to begin in the spring. Regulators will spend several months reviewing the filing before making a decision.

If the rate increase is approved, the earliest Triad customers would see a change on their bills is January 2027.",https://media.wfmynews2.com/assets/WFMY/images/e3d71521-eb0d-4a39-a79a-689b6e25397e/20251125T222445/e3d71521-eb0d-4a39-a79a-689b6e25397e_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:03:00.363797

""Data centers, they require their own distribution networks, and in many cases require upgrades to the transmission networks.""","Energy experts say Michigan's electrical grid can handle current demand, but as more data centers set up shop, the state may need more power and updated transmission to keep the lights on.

""It's an issue that's likely to be debated by our residents and decision makers for many years and even decades to come,"" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said.

Data centers are often used to store the servers that hold large amounts of data and information. They can utilize large amounts of electrical power, too.

Saline Township is debating a major data center project, just like Livingston County.

""I can tell you there is tremendous concern from the community. There is tremendous concern about water use, there is tremendous concern about energy use, there's concern about wells going dry,"" Michigan Sen. Jeff Irwin said.

In Livingston County, many of those same concerns exist as well. Earlier this month, CBS News Detroit reported on the Howell Township Board approving a six-month pause on consideration of what could be one of Michigan's largest data centers on about 1,000 acres of land.

A report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) finds that, across the country, areas with a high number of data centers experience an increased risk of outages, especially during extreme weather.

""It's not just about building new power plants' generation. It's also about building enough transmission and distribution as well,"" Matthew Bandyk, an energy consultant with Citizens Utility Board, said.

Right now, the report finds that Michigan is not in one of the regions at an increased risk for outages, but Bandyk said that as more data center projects move forward, the grid will need improvements.

However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.","Fitch Ratings-Toronto-25 November 2025:

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Xcel Energy Inc.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term IDRs for subsidiaries Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), Northern States Power Company-Minnesota (NSP-Minnesota), Northern States Power Company-Wisconsin (NSP-Wisconsin) at 'A-', and Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) at 'BBB'.

The Stable Rating Outlook on Xcel and its subsidiaries reflects credit supportive capital allocation for elevated capex plan, robust wildfire risk management, and generally stable regulatory environment within its service territories.

A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.

Key Rating Drivers

Xcel Energy Inc.

Credit Supportive Marshall Settlement: Xcel reached a settlement in principle with all claimants related to the 2021 Marshall fire in Colorado ahead of impending trials. Under the settlement terms, Xcel's subsidiary, PSCo will pay settlement claims of $640 million, of which $350 million will be covered by insurance and $290 million absorbed by the company. This is substantially lower than prior estimates.

The Colorado insurance commissioner had estimated property damages could exceed $2 billion, with additional potential for noneconomic and punitive damages. Fitch views the settlement as a prudent risk management measure that significantly reduces uncertainty regarding wildfire liabilities and improves the company's financial risk profile.

Pressured but Improving Financial Metrics: Following the Marshall settlement in 2025, Fitch expects Xcel's financial metrics to improve starting in 2026 and stabilize around 4.8x, at the downgrade threshold, leaving virtually no headroom in its credit metrics. Fitch expects Xcel's credit metrics to improve with the regular rate case cadence, lower deferred fuel balances, credit-supportive capital allocation, and tax credits transferability.

FFO leverage was modestly elevated in the past two years, driven primarily by rate case deferrals and a large, deferred fuel balances from Winter Storm Uri. Fitch's projections reflect recovery of deferred fuel balances, currently under way, and are expected to be mostly recovered by YE 2025. Fitch projects holding company debt to remain at roughly 23% of total consolidated debt and expects equity issuances of roughly $4.5 billion from 2025-2029 to support large capex programs.

Constructive Regulatory Environment: Xcel benefits from stable earnings and operating cash flows across its key regulated utility subsidiaries. Its Minnesota and Wisconsin subsidiaries recover costs timely under multiyear rate plans and earn returns near allowed levels. While PSCo uses cost-recovery riders, its earned return-on-equity lags due to a historical test year and delayed rate case filing. Returns have improved for Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) from constructive rate case decisions, supportive riders, and strong customer growth. Fitch expects the overall regulatory framework to remain mostly constructive, with pending rate cases assumed to achieve favorable outcomes.

Wildfire Exposure: More frequent and larger, more destructive wildfires, especially in the Western U.S., have exposed utilities in those areas to wildfire risk and increased business risk. Although Xcel has been proactive in managing wildfire risk in its service territory, including through a recently approved Colorado wildfire risk mitigation plan and Texas resiliency filing, future catastrophic wildfire activity cannot be ruled out. Xcel plans to invest about $5 billion for wildfire mitigation including $1.9 billion by PSCo in Colorado and $490 million by SPS for system resiliency plan in Texas. PSCo has reached a settlement with intervenors, and Fitch expects a final decision in 2025.

Large Capex Plan: Fitch expects consolidated capex to remain elevated over the forecast period. Fitch projects the base capex plan to total approximately $60 billion over 2026-2030, significantly higher than $27.8 billion spent in the previous five years (2020-2024). The base capex plan focuses on management's steel-for-fuel renewable energy investment strategy, with significant investments in electric transmission to connect renewable resources to the grid and distribution. Xcel's capex plan supports exiting coal generation by YE 2030. The capex also supports projected 5% demand growth over the next five years.

IRA Supports Investment Plan: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allows Xcel to monetize tax credits from existing and new renewable projections more efficiently. Historically, Xcel generated more tax credits than it could utilize. With the IRA, Xcel can realize full cash flow benefits from the production tax credits in a timely manner, a credit positive. Fitch assumes that any tax code changes affecting the ability to monetize tax credits at projected levels would lead to Xcel adjusting its financial plan to support credit ratings.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: here is a parent and subsidiary linkage for Xcel. Legal ring-fencing is considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Access and control are also evaluated as porous. Xcel centrally manages the treasury function for its utilities and is the sole source of equity. There is also a shared RCF for Xcel and its utility subsidiaries; however, each subsidiary issues its own long-term debt. Under Fitch's PSL criteria, the maximum separation between Xcel and its operating utilities' Long-Term IDRs is two notches.

Northern States Power-Minnesota

Constructive Regulation: NSP-Minnesota operates in a relatively constructive and stable regulatory environment across three states, but mainly in Minnesota. Supportive regulatory mechanisms include fuel cost and purchased power adjustments, and capital investment riders for environmental improvements, renewable generation and electric transmission.

Minnesota Electric Rate Case: In early November 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed an electric rate case in Minnesota, seeking a total revenue increase of $491 million (13.2%) over two years, based on a return on equity (ROE) of 10.3%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a rate base of $13.2 billion in 2025 and $14 billion in 2026. NSP-Minnesota also requested interim rates of $224 million, of which $192 million was approved and went into effect in January 2025. A final decision is expected in 2026. Fitch expects a rate case outcome in line with the last rate decision.

The last Minnesota-approved electric rate increase was moderately lower than expected. In June 2023, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) approved a three-year rate increase of $311 million, based on a 9.25% ROE and 52.5% equity ratio. The approved ROE was below the national average, and below the 9.87% ROE and $386 million rate increase that the administrative law judge supported. NSP-Minnesota filed a request for reconsideration, which was subsequently denied by the MPUC in September 2023.

Capex Plan Supports Load Growth: NSP-Minnesota has a large capex plan that includes significant capex associated with management's steel-for-fuel renewable energy investment strategy and electric transmission, and strong expected demand growth. Fitch projects total capex of $20.1 billion over 2026-2030, compared with actual spending of $10.7 billion in 2020-2024. Total projected rate base growth is 10% CAGR over the forecast, above industry averages. Riders for certain capital investments mitigate credit pressures associated with high capex. NSP-Minnesota projects 4% annual load growth over the next five years, driven by data centers ramping up toward the end of the five-year plan.

Strong Financial Metrics: Fitch expects NSP-Minnesota's financial metrics to remain supportive of existing ratings. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage to average 3.8x through 2029. Credit metrics are supported by an assumed realization of tax benefits resulting from the IRA, as NSP-Minnesota is expected to monetize production tax credits generated by its regulated wind generation.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is a parent/subsidiary relationship between Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel) and NSP-Minnesota. Under Fitch's Parent/Subsidiary Linkage criteria, Fitch applies a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach. Fitch views NSP-Minnesota as stronger than Xcel due to its low-risk utility operations and solid credit metrics. Legal ring-fencing, and access and control are considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Thus, the maximum separation between NSP-Minnesota's and Xcel's Long-Term IDRs is up to two notches.

Northern States Power-Wisconsin

Constructive Regulatory Environment: NSP-Wisconsin operates within a constructive regulatory environment overseen by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW). Supportive regulatory measures include an above average authorized ROE, a forward-looking test year, a purchased gas adjustment clause, and annual filings for fuel and purchased energy adjustments.

Rate Case Stayout: In June 2024, NSP-Wisconsin filed a 2025 stay-out proposal with the PSCW. The filing proposes to offset 2025 revenue deficiencies by amortizing IRA deferrals, stopping a deferral related to IRA benefits ordered in a previous rate case, and deferring revenue requirement impacts of two natural gas capital projects. PSCW approved the filing in early 2025.

Large Capex Plan: Fitch's main rating concern is the relatively large capex plan over the forecast. NSP-Wisconsin plans to spend $4 billion over 2026-2030, compared with $1.9 billion of capex spent over 2020-2024. A large share of that capex will be on electric transmission projects, which receive timely recovery of capital costs that mitigates high capex concerns. Total projected rate base growth is 13% CAGR over the forecast, which is above the industry average.

Adequate Financial Metrics: Fitch expects NSP-Wisconsin's financial metrics to remain supportive of existing ratings, despite a large capital investment plan over the forecast. Fitch forecasts funds from operations (FFO) leverage to average 4x-4.4x through 2029.

2025 Rate Case: In November 2025, the PSCW approved a ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, as well as a rate increase of approximately $68 million in 2026 and $57 million in 2027 for the electric utility, which was in line with Fitch's expectations. The PSCW also approved a $18 million rate increase in 2026 and $4.3 million in 2027 for the natural gas utility. These rate increases are based on commission's staff estimates. The new rates will be implemented on Jan. 1, 2026.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is a parent/subsidiary relationship between Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel) and NSP-Wisconsin. Under Fitch's Parent/Subsidiary Linkage criteria, Fitch applies a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach. Fitch views NSP-Wisconsin as stronger than Xcel due to its low-risk utility operations and solid credit metrics. Legal ring-fencing, and access and control are considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Thus, the maximum separation between NSP-Wisonsin's and Xcel's Long-Term IDRs is up to two notches.

Public Service Company of Colorado

Credit Supportive Marshall Settlement: PSCo's holding company, Xcel reached a settlement in principle with all claimants related to the 2021 Marshall fire in Colorado ahead of impending trials. Under the settlement terms, PSCo will pay settlement claims of $640 million, of which $350 million will be covered by insurance and $290 million absorbed by the company. This is substantially lower than prior estimates.

The Colorado insurance commissioner had estimated property damages could exceed $2 billion, with additional potential for noneconomic and punitive damages. Fitch views the settlement as a prudent risk management measure that significantly reduces uncertainty regarding wildfire liabilities and improves the company's financial risk profile.

Wildfire Risk Management: Management has implemented strategies to mitigate wildfire risk, including regular filings of a Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP), a credit positive. PSCo was the first utility in Colorado to develop and file a WMP. The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved its initial five-year WMP in 2020. However, more frequent and destructive wildfires in recent years, especially in western U.S., including Colorado, increase wildfire risk for utilities. Fitch's current rating thresholds for PSCo account for these risks, but catastrophic wildfires could lead to negative rating actions.

In June 2024, PSCo filed an updated WMP with the CPUC, requesting cost recovery for 2025-2027. The estimated plan cost is $1.9 billion, covering Public Safety Power Shutoffs, expanded covered conductors, enhanced powerline safety settings, increased drone use, and undergrounding 50 miles of overhead lines. In April 2025, PSCo filed a unanimous settlement, including WMP approval (with modifications), cost recovery through rider mechanisms, and a commitment to seek securitization of $1.2 billion by January 2029. The CPUC approved the settlement in June 2025.

Relatively Constructive Regulatory Environment: PSCo operates within a relatively constructive and stable regulatory environment overseen by the CPUC, featuring supportive regulatory mechanisms like adjustment clauses for fuel costs and purchased power, trackers for pension expenses and property taxes, riders for transmission investments, and a recently passed distribution rider that helps reduce some regulatory lag. CPUC uses historical test years, resulting in lower-than-allowed earned return on equity (ROE). A supportive regulatory environment is critical as PSCo has a large capital spending program.

Recent Electric Rate Case: In November 2025, PSCo filed a request to increase the revenue by $356 million based on a ROE of 9.8% and equity ratio of 55%. The increase in revenue is primarily driven by recovery of previously incurred infrastructure investments, enhance system reliability and replace ageing infrastructure. A decision is expected by Q3 2026.

Recent Gas Rate Case: In January 2024, PSCo requested a natural gas rate increase of around $170 million, with a ROE of 10.10% and an equity ratio of 55%. CPUC's decision authorizes and maintains the company's existing ROE in the 9.2%-9.5% range, with a midpoint of 9.35%, and its equity ratio in the 53%-55% range, with a midpoint of 54%. The total rate increase approved was $125 million. Colorado regulators rejected PSCO's proposal for the revenue stability mechanism and decoupling tariff. PSCo expects to file another gas rate case application by YE 2025.

Large Capex Plan: PSCo has a large capex plan focused on management's ""steel for fuel"" renewable energy investment strategy and supporting strong demand growth. It also includes spending on gas pipeline integrity and distribution system enhancement. Fitch projects approximately $17.5 billion in capex over 2026-2030, significantly higher than $10.9 billion spent in 2020-2024. This increase is expected to modestly strain credit metrics in the near term.

Financial Metrics: Fitch expects PSCo's financial metrics to support the existing ratings. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage to remain in the 4.2x range through 2029, driven by a lower-than-expected Marshall wildfire settlement, which will result in a one-time charge of $290 million to earnings in 2025 compared with our previous expectation of $2 billion of wildfire liability that was anticipated to be financed with debt and equity.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is a parent/subsidiary relationship between Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel) and PSCo. Under Fitch's Parent/Subsidiary Linkage criteria, Fitch applies a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach. Fitch views PSCo as stronger than Xcel due to its low-risk utility operations and solid credit metrics. Legal ring-fencing, and access and control are considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Thus, the maximum separation between PSCo's and Xcel's Long-Term IDRs is up to two notches.

Southwestern Public Service Company

Improving Regulatory Environment: Fitch views the regulatory environment overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) as more challenging compared with other Xcel Energy Inc. (BBB+/Stable) jurisdictions but has improved in recent years. Authorized ROEs for electric utilities in Texas and New Mexico are historically slightly lower than the national average. Riders for renewable investments and strong sales growth have enabled SPS to earn ROEs closer to the allowed level in the past few years, despite the regulatory lag from the use of a historical test year in Texas.

Supportive rate design mechanisms in Texas and New Mexico include fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and generation riders for energy-efficiency program costs. SPS also has riders for distribution costs, generation investment and transmission infrastructure improvement costs in Texas and for renewable energy program costs in New Mexico. New Mexico now allows for the forward test year filing, which was reflected in the most recent rate case filing. Earnings and cash flows are supported by strong sales growth primarily driven by the oil and gas industry in the service territory.

Rate Cases Settled: Fitch believes the latest rate case settlements/decisions in both jurisdictions reflect an improving regulatory environment. In December 2023, SPS, PUCT staff and intervenors filed a black box settlement, reflecting a base rate increase of $65 million retroactively effective to July 13, 2023, compared with the original ask of $158 million. SPS expects a PUCT decision in 1Q24.

In October 2023, the NMPRC approved SPS's settlement, reflecting a $33 million rate increase, compared with $75 million initially requested, a forward test year, a 9.5% ROE and a 54.7% equity ratio. The settlement also includes the acceleration of the Tolk generating station retirement to 2028. The rates became effective in October 2023.

Continued Capex Spend: Significant spending is associated with management's steel-for-fuel renewable energy investment strategy, with a focus on wind generation and electric transmission investments in New Mexico. Fitch projects capex of approximately $4 billion over 2024-2028, similar to $3.9 billion spent between 2019 and 2023. SPS plans to fully exit coal by 2030. The plan does not include $750 million in potential projects that would help alleviate congestion and enable future load growth and renewables.

Stable Financial Metrics: Fitch forecasts FFO leverage to average roughly 4.5x from 2025 through 2029, which is supportive for the rating. We expect leverage to remain below the negative sensitivity threshold over the forecast period. This is supported by the company's efficient use of tax benefits from the IRA and more constructive rate outcomes. Fitch current base case does not assume any change in the tax policy. Removal of transferability of tax credits would have negative impact on SPS's financial metrics.

Large Capex Supports Load Growth: Significant spending is driven by oil and gas sector electrification, expanding data centers, and economic growth in Texas and New Mexico. Fitch projects capex of approximately $19 billion over 2026-2030, primarily driven by transmission and generation investments. SPS projects strong load growth over next five years at 8% annually, driven by a combination of electrification of oil and gas industry in New Mexico and data center load growth toward the end of the five-year plan.

Recent Rate Cases: Fitch believes the latest rate case settlements/decisions in both jurisdictions reflect an improving regulatory environment. In November 2025, SPS filed a rate case requesting an increase in revenue by $175 million based on a ROE of 10.5% and equity ratio of 56%. A decision in expected by 4Q26. In December 2023, SPS, PUCT staff and intervenors filed a black box settlement, reflecting a base rate increase of $65 million retroactively effective to July 13, 2023, compared with the original ask of $158 million. In April 2024, PUCT approved the settlement as filed.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is parent and subsidiary linkage for Xcel and its subsidiaries. For SPS, the linkage follows strong parent/weak subsidiary path. Fitch considers the legal incentive weak because Xcel does not guarantee SPS's debt. Strategic and operational incentives are also considered weak due to SPS's relatively low contribution to Xcel's consolidated business, resulting in a standalone rating for SPS.

Peer Analysis

Xcel

Xcel's credit profile is weaker than that of WEC Energy Group, Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and stronger than DTE Energy Company (BBB/Stable) and CMS Energy Corporation (BBB/Stable). Xcel, CMS, and WEC are utility parent holding companies that mostly comprise regulated integrated electric and natural gas distribution utilities.

Xcel, WEC, DTE, and CMS all own utilities that operate primarily within constructive regulatory jurisdictions, with Xcel and WEC also benefiting from multistate operations that add geographic and regulatory diversification. Xcel's business risk has increased in recent years due to wildfire activity across its utilities. CMS, DTE, and WEC operate in service territories with limited exposure to wildfire risk.

Fitch forecasts Xcel's FFO leverage to be around 4.9x through 2028. This is stronger than CMS's 5.6x and DTE's 5.4x, and comparable to WEC, where Fitch expects FFO leverage to average 5.1x over the forecast period.

NSP-M

The credit profiles of NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and NSP-Wisconsin are similar and well-positioned at an 'A-' Long-Term IDR. PSCo, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin all operate within relatively constructive regulatory environments with reasonably good rates of return. However, PSCo's earned returns have lagged allowed due to historical test year filings. In addition, PSCo's business risk is higher as it operates in a state with elevated wildfire risk exposure and faces potential wildfire liabilities, unlike its sister utilities.

All three entities have large capex plans, but timely cost recovery in their respective regulatory jurisdictions mitigates high capex issues. PSCo and NSP-Minnesota benefit from a larger scale and scope of operations than NSP-Wisconsin.

The three entities' financial metrics are well-positioned within their rating category. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage in the 4.1x-4.4x range through 2029 for PSCo, 4.0x-4.4x for NSP-Wisconsin and 3.5x-4.0x for NSP-Minnesota.

NSP-W

Northern States Power Company - Minnesota (NSP-Minnesota; A-/Stable) and NSP-Wisconsin have similar credit profiles, both well positioned at an 'A-' Long-Term IDR. In contrast, the credit profile of Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo; A-/Stable) is modestly weaker positioned compared to its sister utilities. PSCo, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin all operate within relatively constructive regulatory environments with reasonably good rates of return. However, PSCo's earned returns lagged allowed due to historical test year filings. PSCo's business risk is higher, as it operates in a state with elevated wildfire risk exposure and faces potential wildfire liabilities, unlike its sister utilities.

PSCo

PSCo's credit profile is modestly weaker than those of Northern States Power Company-Minnesota (NSP Minnesota; A-/Stable) and Northern States Power Company-Wisconsin (NSP-Wisconsin; A-/Stable). All three utilities operate within relatively constructive regulatory environments with reasonably good rates of return. However, PSCo's earned returns have lagged allowed returns due to historical test year filings. In addition, PSCo's higher business risk than its sister utilities as it operates in a state with elevated wildfire risk and potential wildfire liabilities.

All three entities have large capex plans, but timely cost recovery in their respective regulatory jurisdictions mitigates high capex issues. PSCo and NSP-Minnesota benefit from a larger scale and scope of operations than NSP Wisconsin. The three entity's financial metrics are well positioned within their rating category, although PSCo's leverage is expected to remain modestly higher than the other two utilities, due to the large capex program and assumed $2 billion wildfire liability.

The three entities' financial metrics are well-positioned within their rating category. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage in the 4.1x-4.4x range through 2029 for PSCo, 4.0x-4.4x for NSP-Wisconsin and 3.5x-4.0x for NSP-Minnesota.

SPS

The relatively challenging regulatory environment in New Mexico and Texas results in a weaker credit profile for SPS relative to its sister utilities, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo; A-/Stable), Northern States Power Company-Minnesota (NSP-Minnesota; A-/Stable) and Northern States Power Company-Wisconsin (NSP-Wisconsin; A-/Stable).

SPS's credit profile is comparable to its peers Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO; BBB/Stable) and Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO; BBB+/Stable). All have large capex plans but benefit from supportive parent companies. PSO operates in a relatively more constructive regulatory environment than SPS and SWEPCO, both of which operate in Texas and other more challenging jurisdictions. However, SPS's regulatory outcomes and earned ROEs improved in recent years. At the same time, SPS's business risk has increased due to elevated wildfire risk exposure and potential wildfire liabilities.

Fitch forecasts SPS's FFO leverage to average roughly 4.5x through 2029, which compares favorably to both SWEPCO and PSO. PSO's elevated leverage is projected to fall below the downgrade threshold of 4.8x over the forecast period. Fitch expects SWEPCO FFO leverage will stay around 5.0x over the forecast.

ESG Considerations

Xcel Energy Inc. has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Customer Welfare - Fair Messaging, Privacy & Data Security due to the uncertainty on involvement of utility's equipment in sparking the wildfires and the devastation caused to its customers, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Xcel Energy Inc. has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Environmental Impacts due to heightened risk from wildfires and the uncertainty about utility-sparked wildfires, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Xcel Energy Inc. has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Social Impacts due to adverse customer and other constituent impacts associated with unusual wildfire activity, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Southwestern Public Service Company has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Customer Welfare - Fair Messaging, Privacy & Data Security due to the involvement of SPS's equipment in sparking the largest wildfire in Texas history and the devastation caused to its customers, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Southwestern Public Service Company has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Environmental Impacts due to heightened risk from wildfires and the uncertainty about utility-sparked wildfires, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Southwestern Public Service Company has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Social Impacts due to unusual wildfire activity in SPS service territory that is causing material adverse customer impacts, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

ESG Relevance Scores for Exposure to Environmental Impacts, Social Impacts and Customer Welfare of '4' has been revised from '5' for both Xcel and SPS. The score was set at '5' following the wildfires in SPS service territory in 2024, which resulted in tightening of FFO leverage sensitivities due to the increases wildfire risk and change in the Outlook to Negative from Stable. Subsequently, Xcel has been taking measures to improve grid reliability, including wildfire risk, in the face of the extreme weather, but exposure to wildfire risk at its two subsidiaries remains.

The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

NRG Energy Investment Narrative Recap

NRG Energy shareholders are typically betting on sustained grid demand growth and the company’s ability to capture higher-margin opportunities as electrification accelerates, especially in major Texas markets. The newly announced US$370 million Texas Energy Fund loan increases NRG’s capacity for reliable power delivery but does not materially shift the key short-term catalyst: strong load growth and premium contract wins; nor does it resolve the business’s largest risk, which remains long-term exposure to fossil fuel regulation and debt-related financial pressure.

Among recent company developments, NRG’s expanded buyback authorization, up to US$3,000 million through 2028, is especially relevant, underscoring confidence in future cash flows supported by growth investments like the Greens Bayou plant, yet it also heightens leverage at a time of increased capital demands and sector uncertainty.

But in contrast to optimism about new capacity and share repurchases, investors should be aware of the persistent risks from rising regulatory scrutiny and the implications for NRG’s gas-heavy...

CHENNAI: This calendar year has turned out to be an impressive one for battery-powered electric vehicles in the country. For the first time, total EV registrations across all segments have crossed the milestone of 2 million units - and the year is still not over, with more than a month to go. The surge highlights rising consumer interest, better product availability and continued policy support for EV adoption. As of Tuesday, for this calendar year, EV registrations (excluding hybrids) stood at 2.02 million units as against 1.95 million units in 2024. Despite EV policy changes, demand has remained strong, driven by falling battery costs, a gradually expanding charging network, and new longer-range models. As sales of electric vehicles (EV) gain momentum, the growth is mainly powered by electric two-wheelers. According to Vahan data, electric two-wheeler segment continues to be the major driver of total EV registrations, accounting for 57% of the total volumes during this calendar year. ""We expect mid-teen growth in 2025, softer than last year's 27% surge but still healthy, supported by firm two-wheeler demand, steady three-wheeler fleet electrification and a competitive four-wheeler launch pipeline, indicating a sustainable growth cycle,"" said Poonam Upadhyay, director, Crisil Ratings. It is gathered that magnet shortages are manageable for now, with softer battery costs and rising localisation helping cushion the impact. The launch of higher-range, faster-charging models is also supporting demand. Total electric two-wheeler sales have grown to 1.2 million units year-to-date, slightly higher than the full-year number of 1.15 million achieved in 2024. ""Established OEMs have driven electric two-wheeler growth this year, leveraging extensive dealer networks, competitive pricing, and higher-range models to expand customer base and boost retail confidence despite policy changes,"" Upadhyay added. Among all categories, the electric passenger vehicle segment which include electric cars and SUVs) recorded a growth of 57% at 156,455 units year-to-date, compared with 99,429 units in 2024. Electric cars and SUVs are gaining traction, driven by a wider range of mid-range models and improved total cost of ownership. ""While charging infrastructure remains a consideration for long-distance travel, it's no longer a major concern for urban buyers who can rely on home and workplace charging. Expanding networks and increasing ranges are easing earlier infrastructure concerns,"" she said. Electric three-wheeler sales stood at 6.9 lakh units year-to-date as against 6.91 lakh units in 2024.

The two-day summit, held Nov. 19-20 at the Old Eucalyptus Schoolhouse in El Centro, brought hundreds together to confront the region’s most pressing environmental and public health challenges that ranged from air-quality inequities to workforce training gaps tied to Imperial Valley’s rapidly expanding clean-energy sector. Through plenaries, workshops and collaborative discussions, speakers emphasized that meaningful progress begins with transparent decision-making and solutions informed by those who live with the consequences of environmental burdens daily.

CCV Executive Director Luis Olmedo underscored that point from the very start, describing the summit as a space designed to counter misinformation and fear with data, dignity and collective problem-solving.

“Each year, this summit reminds us that the people most affected by environmental and health burdens are also the people who lead the solutions,” he said, noting that community voices must remain at the center of decisions around air quality, public health protections and local economic opportunity.

This year’s event also placed a heightened focus on youth leadership and workforce development, bringing students and young advocates into discussions on air pollution, climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, and the emerging opportunities tied to Lithium Valley and zero-emission transportation.

A Region Rallying for Environmental Justice

Over the past 14 years, CCV has built a model recognized statewide: pairing community knowledge with scientific research and regulatory partnerships to address long-standing inequities. This year’s summit reflected that legacy in sessions that spanned energy transition, Salton Sea health impacts, community benefits agreements, and climate-adaptation planning.

Speakers like Luz Gallegos, executive director of Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC), reminded attendees that the fight for environmental justice is inseparable from the fight for representation. “People in power are accountable for the residents,” she said. “They represent all residents — regardless of background or immigrant status.”

The call to hold institutions accountable was echoed by participants who highlighted the pressure on farmworker communities, the need for expanded bilingual outreach, and the importance of long-term investments in public health infrastructure.

Workshops Spotlight Data, Clean Energy, and Local Impacts

One of the most attended workshops — “The Devil Is in the Details” — centered on CCV and Earthworks’ environmental review of the Hell’s Kitchen Lithium and Power Project.

Presenters walked attendees through the project’s potential health and ecological impacts, noting threats to already overburdened communities, fragile ecosystems, and culturally significant tribal lands if strong safeguards are not implemented. The workshop drew widespread conversation as policymakers, nonprofit leaders, and residents questioned how to protect local communities while participating in the clean-energy boom.

Another session, led by GoFundMe.org Weather Resilience Program representative Rich Kotchmar, detailed how philanthropic partnerships are helping communities build air purifiers and heat-resilience programs from the ground up. “Very quickly we found that the solutions were there,” Kotchmar said. “They just needed to be resourced and have a full program behind them.”

Youth Leadership Takes Center Stage

A standout feature of the summit was the visible presence of youth, many of whom attended as part of environmental clubs, school programs, or CCV’s own youth engagement initiatives. Students participated in discussions on air pollution, climate science, worker protection, and renewable-energy careers.

Their participation aligns with CCV’s long-term goal of preparing the next-generation clean-energy workforce — especially as projects like Lithium Valley reshape the region’s economic landscape. Adriana Buelna, a participant in The Becoming Project, emphasized how agricultural modernization and green-technology innovation directly tie into job growth and worker health.

“Forever Green Farms is a project that not only will add jobs in the Imperial Valley,” she said, “its goal is to make us more efficient and sustainable.”

Advancing Workforce, Health, and Community Resilience

Community health workers and advocates from across the Valley also highlighted the urgency of investing in specialized field training and safety protections for agricultural and service workers.

Ma Oliva Gonzalez, of the Sure Helpline Center, said she is hopeful about new projects emerging across the region. “It is very enthusiastic to see that farm workers are becoming more specialized in their profession,” she said, noting that many more projects are needed to build a safer and more sustainable workforce.

Across panels, community members reiterated the importance of pairing economic growth with meaningful protections, especially as drought, extreme heat, and air-quality challenges increase.

A Summit Rooted in Collaboration and Shared Purpose

With support from major statewide foundations, including The California Endowment, Waverley Street Foundation, Latino Community Foundation, and The California Wellness Foundation, this year’s summit amplified CCV’s vision: that environmental justice is built through partnership, transparency, and sustained community power.

Throughout the sessions, Olmedo urged attendees to remain united, especially in polarized times. “In times of uncertainty, when we are experiencing community challenges, there is also room for opportunity,” he said. “The opportunity of resilience, the opportunity of coming together and working together.” And in closing, he offered a final reminder of the summit’s purpose:

The most recent WRDA, the Water Resources Development Act of 2024, was signed into law by President Biden on January 4, 2025. Congress has enacted a bipartisan WRDA every two years since 2014, making the upcoming bill the seventh consecutive bipartisan WRDA.

WRDAs provide Members of Congress the opportunity to authorize U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works projects to improve the nation’s ports and harbors, the inland waterway navigation network, flood and storm protection, and other water resources infrastructure. WRDA projects have national, regional, and local significance and help strengthen the nation’s global competitiveness, grow the economy, move goods throughout the country and abroad, protect communities, and create jobs.

These projects originate at the local level and go through a rigorous vetting process before they may be considered for inclusion in a WRDA. WRDAs allow Congress to have direct involvement in what projects the Corps studies and, ultimately, constructs. This legislation also provides Congress the opportunity to address program and policy reforms within the civil works program to help projects get built safely and efficiently, and in a more cost-effective way.

WRDA projects typically require two separate authorizations from Congress: (1) the authority to study the feasibility of a project, followed by (2) the authority to construct, operate, and/or maintain the project. Completed feasibility studies are submitted to Congress in the form of a Chief’s Report from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Chief of Engineers. If the results and recommendations contained in the Chief’s Report are favorable, a construction authorization for the project can be included in a future WRDA. The costs for feasibility studies and construction are generally split between a non-federal sponsor and the Corps.

After nearly a decade of flat growth, the US Energy Information Administration projects that annual demand across the United States will grow 2.4 percent in 2025 and 2.6 percent in 2026. Meeting that demand affordably poses a formidable challenge. Oil and gas markets are volatile, while renewables have intermittency challenges and vulnerable supply chains. In this environment, accelerating the development of geothermal energy could help reduce exposure to these risks.

Compared to solar, wind, or battery storage, geothermal power relies relatively less on critical minerals like cobalt and lithium. And, unlike oil and gas generation, geothermal requires no fuel. As a result, geothermal can provide round-the-clock baseload power with lower exposure to disruptions in global supply chains.

As the cost of enhanced geothermal technologies continues to decrease and their geographic reach expands, now is the time for policymakers, especially in the United States, to take a serious look at geothermal as a key part of their energy security strategy.

The value of geothermal

Geothermal energy taps the earth’s internal heat for electricity and heating. A traditional geothermal well accesses natural steam and hot water, while an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) fractures hot rock and circulates fluid to absorb subsurface heat. This heat produces steam, which returns to the surface to spin turbines that generate electricity. Traditionally, geothermal energy production was limited to tectonic boundaries or hotspots where the earth’s crust is thin and subterranean heat is at its highest. However, technological advances, including drilling techniques borrowed from the oil and gas sector, have now made geothermal commercially viable in a broader range of locations.

In terms of energy security, geothermal offers two major advantages compared to other sources.

First, it can provide 24/7 baseload power without the need for fuel. Insulated from volatile global commodity markets, geothermal can offer the energy resilience necessary to achieve US energy policy priorities, like independently powering domestic and overseas US military bases and the fast-growing US data center industry. In fact, a growing number of tech giants are signing offtake agreements with geothermal companies to power artificial intelligence (AI) operations, including Meta’s agreements for 150 megawatts (MW) each from Sage Geosystems and XGS Energy, and Google’s agreements with Fervo Energy and NV Energy for 115 MW.

Second, geothermal is not as reliant on vulnerable supply chains as wind and solar are. China controls a high percentage of the global supplies of many minerals that are essential to the manufacture of wind and solar components and systems, especially in midstream refining. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals, China is the leading refiner, with an average market share of 70 percent. China refines 91 percent of rare earths, 77 percent of cobalt, 70 percent of lithium, 44 percent of copper, and 42 percent of chromium. According to International Aluminum data, it also consistently accounts for around 60 percent of aluminum production.

While geothermal technology uses more chromium than wind and solar, it uses less of other critical minerals, especially when battery storage is added to a system. Geothermal requires less copper and aluminum than solar photovoltaics, and less copper, rare earth minerals, and zinc compared to wind. Adding battery storage to intermittent wind and solar dramatically increases the need for chromium, cobalt, lithium, and rare earths even further for these technologies.

Downstream, the IEA estimates that China’s share in key solar panel manufacturing stages exceeds 80 percent. In terms of wind development, the IEA in its Energy Technology Perspectives 2023 also estimated China accounts for 70 to 80 percent of global blade manufacturing, 45 to 50 percent of tower production, and around 70 percent [SJ8] [PS9] of nacelle (turbine covers) assembly capacity. While geothermal still relies on global markets for standard components like turbines, steel, and piping, its ability to leverage the existing assets and technologies of the US oil and gas sector—primarily for drilling—significantly reduces its exposure to risks in the supply chain.

Geothermal also offers another major advantage: Multiple projects for lithium extraction from geothermal brine in California’s Salton Sea, as well in the Smackover Formation in Arkansas and the Upper Rhine Graben in Europe, show how geothermal could even become a net producer of critical minerals.

Renewed US interest in geothermal

Recent support from President Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright places geothermal firmly among the administration’s pillars for securing US energy dominance. In a speech in March 2025, Wright suggested that although geothermal “hasn’t achieved liftoff yet, it should and it can,” adding it “could help enable AI, manufacturing, reshoring, and stop the rise of our electricity prices.” Meanwhile, Trump’s executive orders, as recently as July, have consistently identified geothermal as a key resource to be developed and allowed expedited permitting.

This renewed enthusiasm has highlighted key areas for White House and Congressional cooperation:

Permitting reform: Establishing more streamlined permitting processes, including ensuring better interagency coordination and adequate resources would reduce uncertainty and project timelines, directly increasing their bankability.

Categorical exclusions (CXs): The Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) could expand on its April 2024 and January 2025 adoption of CXs that exempt certain low-impact, early-stage activities from separate environmental reviews. The US Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that the January 2025 CX alone could shorten the geothermal permitting process by up to a year. Expanding CXs for other early-stage, low-impact activities and allowing concurrent environmental reviews for different phases of the same project would further shorten project timelines, boosting investor appeal.

Interagency cooperation: Designating one agency to conduct a single, unified review could further accelerate project timelines. Currently, developers must often complete a full environmental review with the BLM and then a second, separate review with the US Forest Service.

Sufficient staffing: Expeditious permitting also requires adequate staff to process requests, a factor for policymakers to consider amid proposed reductions to the workforce, including in key state offices responsible for federal licensing.

Continued tax credits and research and development (R&D) support:

Tax credits: The Trump administration’s maintenance of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) tax credits for geothermal is a win for the sector. Based on National Renewable Energy Laboratory data, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that the IRA’s tax credits could lead to the levelized cost of electricity from EGS to drop by nearly 85 percent, to $60 to $70 per megawatt-hour, making it competitive with other firm and intermittent energy sources.

Federal R&D support: The DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office has helped advance drilling and reservoir techniques at the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) demonstration laboratory in Utah, but more research is needed. Challenges for EGS include drilling into hot rock, which represents over half the project’s budget and destroys standard equipment. This is compounded by the uncertainty of whether a viable underground fracture network can be successfully engineered to circulate water and extract heat without causing issues like induced seismic disturbances. Sustained federal support for testbeds like FORGE will help overcome these challenges, catalyze advances, reduce costs, and enable the scaling of traditional geothermal and EGS across the United States.

By prioritizing the rapid development of geothermal, policymakers could help the United States build a unique path to energy security—one that delivers reliable power 24/7, insulated from global hydrocarbon markets and vulnerable supply chains.

The state’s second wind farm opened last year, which was the newest addition providing power to 28,000 homes while providing an economic boost to Chowan County.

On Tuesday, Timbermill Wind’s developers, Apex Clean Energy, presented local leaders with its first property tax payment, nearly $750,000.

“We’re paying as much in property taxes this year as the top nine taxpayers combined in 2024,” said spokesman Brian O’Shea.

The project includes 45 wind turbines operating on land shared with a soybean, corn and cotton farm as well as forested property for timber harvest. O’Shea explains the turbines are tall enough most of the land can still be used for agricultural purposes while it’s leased out to Apex.

“You know, with commodity prices and trade policy has really, you know, made life difficult for for American farmers, and wind energy is just one other lifeline for those farmers to be able to have some income they can depend on regardless of what’s going on in the global economy.”

Last year, Channel 9 was at the event as a bipartisan group of state leaders celebrated the construction of North Carolina’s second wind farm, Timbermill Wind.

It took nearly 11 years to permit and build Timbermill Wind. The only previous wind development, Amazon Wind in Edenton, was built nearly 10 years earlier.

O’Shea said new permitting rules allowed Timbermill to get off the ground and set the stage for further projects, hopefully with a quicker timeline.

“We were the first project ever to go through that new state process and navigate it,” he said then. “So, now there’s at least a roadmap for a future developer.”

However, the winds shifted a year later.

Federal policy has made it harder to get the permits necessary to build new wind power and expiring tax credits mean new projects would be more expensive.

In its 2024 iteration of its long term plan, Duke Energy planned to have wind generation on its grid by 2033. In the edition of the plan released this year, the utility is not expecting to add any wind projects to the grid for the next 15 years.

“It’s not economically viable to at least the 2040s,” said Bill Norton, a Duke Energy spokesman.

Karly Brownfield with the Southeastern Wind Coalition said this plan misses out on the potential the state has on and offshore to develop clean power while relying too heavily on coal and gas power.

“We see natural gas prices go up and down. We see utilities become more dependent on natural gas,” she said. “There’s a really great opportunity for wind to provide kind of a natural hedge against those prices.”

As evidence, Brownfield points to other southeastern utilities still moving forward on wind development, including neighboring Dominion Energy, which recently released a request for proposals for wind in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.

“It’s kind of a very sharp contrast between how different utilities are are kind of digesting all this uncertainty,” she said.

As the Carolinas face steep increases in energy demand over the next decade, Brownfield believes it’s not time to rule out a home-grown source of power.

“Whether you’re approaching that from an energy security perspective, if you’re thinking about the economic benefit for rural landowners or communities just meeting energy demand and load growth,” Brownfield said. “there are a lot of ways that wind is still applicable.”

The House Natural Resources Committee just greenlit the SPEED Act, a bill that can help make life more affordable by cutting red tape and making sure America is once again able to build energy projects quickly and efficiently.

As the AI revolution picks up pace, America’s energy demand is soaring. However, our supply simply hasn’t kept up; as a result, our utility bills are higher than ever before.

To get prices down, we need to rapidly expand our energy infrastructure.

We have the resources and the people ready to get to work. But our slow and convoluted permitting system is keeping hundreds of energy projects stuck in limbo as they try (and many times fail) to navigate our bureaucratic maze.

But there’s a solution.

The SPEED Act, a bipartisan bill that recently advanced out of committee, will get rid of many of the hurdles that are holding our energy industry back and are working together to keep your utility bill high.

Watch AFP Managing Director Kent Strang break down what this would mean for you:

No more delays: Let’s get up to SPEED

Building in America can be a slow, bureaucratic, and sometimes impossible task.

Many energy and construction projects are stalled before the first shovel touches the ground, tangled up in layers of complex regulations.

One of the chief culprits behind this “death by delay” is the expansion of the National Environmental Policy Act from a relatively straightforward analysis of proposed projects into an intractable regulatory nightmare that takes years to complete.

Signed into law on January 1, 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of any major federal action that might have an effect on the environment.

This review has turned into a lengthy process that takes around 3.5 years to finish and produces 450-page-long reports, on average.

The SPEED Act will bring American construction forward by:

Setting clear NEPA review timelines

Defining which major federal actions need a NEPA review

Limiting judicial reviews

Streamlining bureaucracy

The SPEED Act will help cut through red tape, making it faster and cheaper to build. That means builders will see lower costs that can contribute to more affordable living for all of us.

AFP is on the ground

Permitting reform might sound like a wonky debate, but everyday Americans are feeling the real-life consequences of years of bureaucracy and red tape when they see their utility bills rise and good construction jobs dry up.

That’s why we kicked off the “Road to Prosperity” tour. We’ve been on the move across more than six states, engaging with communities about energy reform and visiting sites ranging from oil rigs and coal mines to facilities in places such as Louisiana and Wyoming.

We’ve talked to workers whose jobs depend on new projects, families who can’t afford higher energy prices, and business leaders who are tired of seeing new opportunities blocked by Washington red tape.

Everywhere we go, we hear the same thing: America wants to build. Washington just won’t let us.

Policies like the SPEED Act can change the game and get America ready for a future where we can build fast and get our economy back on track.

Each year, American households throw away about 26 million tons of food, while food processors, grocers, and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.
While prevention remains the best strategy to reduce wasted food, biogas systems help ensure the food that still gets discarded is used productively.
As of this month, 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19% increase over the past five years.
In addition, 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.","As Americans prepare to enjoy their Thanksgiving feasts, the American Biogas Council released new data today highlighting the growth of biogas systems that convert food waste into energy. On Thanksgiving Day alone, Americans will throw away about 160,000 tons of food scraps, representing $550 million worth of food tossed in a single day, according to the non-profit ReFED. Each year, American households throw away about 26 million tons of food, while food processors, grocers, and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.

While prevention remains the best strategy to reduce wasted food, biogas systems help ensure the food that still gets discarded is used productively. These systems capture the energy from surplus food and other organic material (like manure and wastewater solids) as they break down. Biogas facilities use anaerobic digestion to recycle waste into energy that can be used to power and heat homes, fuel vehicles, or generate electricity through engines and fuel cells.

As of this month, 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19% increase over the past five years. The ABC reports that 118 of these facilities recycle food waste only, handling over 10 million tons of pre- and post-consumer inedible scraps each year.

Wastewater treatment plants and farm-based biogas systems also recycle some discarded food. The ABC counts 124 wastewater plants in the U.S. that combine food waste with wastewater solids to generate energy, recycling an additional 1.1 million tons of wasted food each year. In addition, 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.

In total, every year, these facilities recycle 12.8 million tons of food scraps and other organic waste into over 35 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of biogas a year, enough to cover the year-long energy use of 283,000 U.S. households.

“The U.S. still overlooks the enormous value in food processing scraps and inedible food,” said ABC Executive Director Patrick Serfass. “Biogas facilities can convert this waste into enough home-grown energy to supply the needs of millions of Americans, while creating jobs and catalyzing new, local investments. We hope more municipalities and industrial food processors will choose to invest in biogas systems to recycle their resources locally.”

Looking into the future, if three-quarters of the discarded food from homes, grocers, restaurants, and food processors were recycled in biogas systems, we could turn that wasted material into 115 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of biogas per year, equivalent to the energy needs of nearly one million U.S households.

While considerable potential remains, the biogas sector is expected to continue to expand to transform discarded food into valuable energy, showing a practical way to reduce waste and support home-grown renewable power.

Divert will accept unsold, non-donatable food from General Produce’s distribution center to Divert’s Integrated Diversion & Energy Facility in Turlock, California. There, it will undergo Divert’s depackaging and anaerobic digestion processes, which destroy branded packaging and transform organics into carbon-negative renewable energy and nutrient-rich soil amendment. The energy and soil amendment are returned to the community to power homes and enrich local soils.

Divert will also conduct data collection and analysis to support waste mandate compliance, produce sustainability reporting, and identify additional opportunities to reduce waste. Divert services over 1,900 locations across California for customers, including Blue Diamond Growers, Raley’s, United States Cold Storage, and more.

“Together with Divert, we’re keeping organic waste out of landfills, transforming what can’t be donated into renewable energy, and continuing to drive meaningful change across our industry,” said Brian Hamilton, General Produce’s Director of Operations. “As a leading produce distributor, we know firsthand how important it is to make the most of every food item that comes through our warehouse, and this partnership allows us to do just that. Combining Divert’s innovative technology with our long-standing commitment to sustainability and core values of continuous improvement and concern for people creates a smarter, cleaner, and more responsible supply chain.”

This program will help General Produce meet the compliance requirements of California’s Senate Bill 1383 (SB 1383), a statewide organic waste policy that mandates diversion of organic waste from landfills. California produces nearly half of the country’s vegetables and over three-quarters of its fruits and nuts, so it’s critical that the nutrients and value in any unsold produce are repurposed into beneficial products, like renewable energy and soil amendment.

“Our partnership with General Produce builds on the work we are doing across California to eliminate wasted food in the state and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the food value chain,” said Andrew Johnston, VP and GM, Industrials at Divert. “Divert’s work with food and beverage manufacturers, distributors, and other commercial operators across the country helps these businesses simplify their operations and drive supply chain efficiencies, all while reducing their carbon footprints in an immediately tangible way. This collaboration not only exemplifies General Produce’s commitment to sustainability but also their inspiring stewardship of their customers’ products in ensuring no food – including packaged and recalled material – goes to waste.”

In 2024, the company opened its Integrated Diversion & Energy Facility in Turlock, California, to support rapidly growing demand from its customer base. The Turlock facility complements Divert’s existing in-state infrastructure that helps provide edible food to communities in need.

In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.
NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.
Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all.
""When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,"" Wolfe told CBS News.","Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.

As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.

In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.

More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.

""When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,"" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.

Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing share are using electricity.

A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.

The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.

More Americans at risk of shutoffs

When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.

Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.

Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.

While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.

""Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,"" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.

Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.

Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.

Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.

""When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,"" Wolfe told CBS News. ""That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/25/ed49d359-0131-4870-8b9e-04feaa5717b9/thumbnail/1200x630/32e465d2856bcddfe04fb46d113cd641/gettyimages-2157928317.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 17:04:17.282199

Autonomous, connected and intelligent systems

Mobility drives the pace of everyday life, and today, the transportation landscape is undergoing a profound transformation driven by rapid advances in autonomous systems — from connected vehicles to commercial drones. These technologies promise greater operational efficiency and the emergence of entirely new modes of travel. WSU researchers are at the forefront of this transition, working to make intelligent machines safer, more effective and more responsive. In the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, Associate Professor of Computer Science Dr. Zheng Dong leads efforts to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, ensuring they can interact seamlessly with human drivers and navigate the complexities of modern urban environments.

“We are in a new era of artificial intelligence, where deep neural networks are transforming the perception pipeline, path-planning and control algorithms of autonomous vehicles. These advances are opening new frontiers in real-time embedded systems research and demanding novel solutions to ensure that such systems remain safe and effective,” said Dong. “By leveraging these powerful AI technologies, human innovation and creativity can be further amplified in this field. We hope our research lays a solid foundation for the development of safe and effective autonomous vehicle and machine systems.”

Work in this area is taking Wayne State to new heights in other ways, as well. Dr. Yanchao Liu, assistant professor of industrial and systems engineering, is advancing next-generation commercial drone technologies with applications in logistics, agriculture, public safety, and national defense. Building on his high-density aerial traffic management framework, Liu’s research has helped position Wayne State University as a leader in autonomous mobility systems. This expertise recently contributed to a major achievement: Airspace Experience Technologies (ASX), a long-standing industry partner of Liu’s lab, secured a contract from the U.S. Department of the Air Force to demonstrate a joint command system that could manage automated air and ground vehicles at multiple Air National Guard installations.

“This partnership represents an exciting opportunity to translate years of theoretical research into real-world impact,” said Liu. “Our work in high-density aerial traffic management has always been driven by a vision of safer, more efficient, and more equitable mobility.”

Almost all modern technologies are dependent on the semiconductor industry, and Dr. Charles Winter, professor of chemistry in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, has led research that dramatically improved the speed, power and efficiency of next-generation computer chips that power the artificial intelligence behind self-driving cars and other advanced machines.

Sustainable energy, next-generation batteries and electric mobility

Wayne State is also at the forefront of the clean transportation transition — the shift away from fossil fuels. The Center for Electric, Connected and Autonomous Technologies (eCAT), led by Dr. Caishang Wang, professor of electrical and computer engineering in the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, is advancing research in sustainable energy systems, electric vehicle infrastructure and smart grid integration. ECAT is a National Science Foundation Industry-University Cooperative Research Center, tasked with developing sustainable mobility technologies such as V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communications and real-time edge computing.

WSU is also at the forefront of research on cleaner, more efficient energy storage for electric vehicles. Dr. Leela Arava, professor of mechanical engineering and associate dean for research and graduate studies, leads research focused on high-energy, rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li/S) batteries, which can store five times more energy than their lithium-ion counterparts and are set to be the next generation of batteries. Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Dr. Mahbub Islam’s research focuses on magnesium-carbon dioxide batteries, which use abundant, low-cost magnesium and convert carbon dioxide into electricity.

He stresses how crucial this research is for advancing efficient battery technologies and promoting environmental sustainability — efforts that stand to impact millions, if not billions, of people worldwide.

“Electrochemical energy storage is vital for harnessing energy from intermittent renewables like solar and wind and electrifying the transportation sector to achieve a carbon-neutral future. Current lithium batteries, while offering high energy densities, encounter challenges related to scarcity, geopolitical issues and the high cost of lithium. Therefore, alternative energy storage technologies that utilize low-cost, environmentally friendly materials are necessary to facilitate the transition to a sustainable energy future.”

Safer, smarter and more equitable transportation

Beyond technology, Wayne State’s research is improving the ways people travel and connect. For example, WSU’s Transportation Research Group. conducts research on a broad spectrum of mobility areas, including pedestrian safety, safety belt and child car seat use, transit wheelchair lifts, traffic signals, speed limits, heavy-duty trucks, bicycle safety, and more.

Meanwhile, researchers are also using artificial intelligence to enhance public transportation — from optimizing public transit routes for hourly workers to developing data-driven solutions that improve accessibility for people with disabilities. Dr. Xiaodong Qian, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, is leading research to develop a real-time crowdsourcing tool to collect, analyze and respond to public feedback about everything from routes and safety to cleanliness and reliability on transit services using AI.

This data aids in project siting by highlighting less constrained areas of the grid, helping developers choose locations with higher chances of economic success.
Xcel initially suggested a very narrow use of flexible interconnection, applying only to certain parts of its grid for specific projects, and had no firm plans for flexible load.
Flexible interconnection clearly is one tool that could be available.","Recently, Xcel filed a proposal with the Minnesota PUC to build the Midwest’s largest battery energy system (BESS) facility at the Sherco Energy Hub.

While determining the extent and manner of the utility’s future investments in Colorado’s distribution system, the Colorado PUC emphasised the importance of allowing flexible operation of load and generation from distributed energy resources (DERs) to reduce the costs associated with distribution system investments.

The decision was heavily influenced by recommendations from the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). IREC says it exemplifies how the PUC leverages its regulatory authority to prevent monopoly utilities from obstructing clean energy deployment.

Xcel’s ‘totally useless’ hosting capacity analysis

The grid transparency sections of the decision focused on Xcel’s hosting capacity analysis (HCA). This map-based tool offers a snapshot of the electric grid’s conditions, showing where new generation or load can be added safely without expensive and lengthy upgrades to infrastructure.

This data aids in project siting by highlighting less constrained areas of the grid, helping developers choose locations with higher chances of economic success.

Xcel was initially instructed in 2021 to allocate ratepayer funds for developing an HCA. However, the data it released was “plagued with issues”, making it difficult to use.

Issues included incomplete information necessary for effective siting decisions, excessive redaction of data, and requiring users to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) described by the PUC as “commercially unreasonable” to access clear HCA maps or tabular data, along with multiple other problems.

As Stanfield explains, “The problem is that the NDA was written by Xcel without any input from customers and was completely commercially unreasonable. Realistically, nobody can sign it. IREC couldn’t sign it. We were literally saying, ‘We can’t sign this. We can’t even look at the maps to see if they’re good or not,’ because the NDA was so onerous.”

Despite recent legislative mandates for Xcel to publish a detailed hosting capacity map for both load and generation, Xcel declined to make the load map publicly accessible. The PUC dismissed the utility’s claims that these measures were needed for grid security and decided that the company must release unredacted data without requiring NDAs from users. Additionally, it called for improved data granularity.

Describing the importance of the enhancements in the level of HCA detail that Xcel will now need to provide, IREC Regulatory Engineer Midhat Mafazy explained:

“(The current level of detail) is like being told there’s traffic on Interstate 55 somewhere between Chicago and St. Louis. It’s vague and not very useful. Developers need more granular data that pinpoints where constraints are and why congestion is happening. These improvements will make the data massively more useful for deploying clean energy and EV charging infrastructure, and smarter grid planning overall.”

Stanfield further explains, “Xcel takes pretty much the most extreme position of any utility that’s been required to or has voluntarily published a hosting capacity map. All other – there’s something like 40 or more hosting capacity maps that are published in the United States, and none of them require an NDA.”

Additionally, Xcel previously conducted a load hosting capacity analysis but only published it in a table or spreadsheet format, rather than as a map, which IREC says posed several problems. The utility also did not provide the nodal results.

Reviewing the spreadsheet made it hard to identify the actual location, rendering it “totally useless” since knowing capacity on a random segment doesn’t assist someone trying to locate a site.

Xcel claimed that withholding the data was necessary to ensure the security of the electricity grid. However, the PUC dismissed this argument and decided that the utility must publish “unredacted data” without requiring users to sign an NDA.

Stanfield adds, “The linkage between publication of a hosting capacity map and an increased risk of attacks on the distribution system is very weak or non-existent. It’s basically speculative, and that’s what the commission found.”

The PUC’s decision

The PUC also decided that Xcel must create a policy for flexible interconnection and energisation.

Stanfield notes, “The other thing that IREC was involved in for this proceeding was getting the commission to require Xcel to publish a flexible interconnection and a flexible load tariff. They had been dragging their feet and not really doing it and not committing to doing either, and the Commission required them to publish both flexible interconnection and flexible energisation, or flexible interconnection, for load, which is really significant.”

Flexible interconnection allows generation or load projects to connect to the grid with the ability to adjust the power they send or draw as system capacity varies.

Xcel initially suggested a very narrow use of flexible interconnection, applying only to certain parts of its grid for specific projects, and had no firm plans for flexible load. IREC argued that these eligibility criteria were too restrictive and advised establishing a formal tariff outlining eligibility, review processes, and implementation steps. The PUC’s ruling aligns with IREC’s recommendation.

PUC Commissioner Megan Gilman noted of flexible interconnection, “One of (our) state goals is getting DERs, getting new customers and loads, connected in a cost-effective and timely manner. Flexible interconnection clearly is one tool that could be available. Limiting that option, dragging (their) feet, acting like a more narrow option is all that’s necessary gets to the bigger question, of ‘Does it appear the company is actually strategically trying to meet those state goals?’”

From IREC’s viewpoint, this decision is a positive move toward holding Xcel Energy accountable for customer needs and advancing the broader clean energy and transportation goals of the State of Colorado.

A formal written order recording the verbal decisions from the public proceeding is anticipated in December.

It is unclear, however, based on the company’s activity, whether it will comply with those orders. The uncertainty is being caused by the strong positions Xcel took in this hearing.

Stanfield says, “During the deliberations where the commissioners were talking about what they were going to require, they all expressed a sort of deep distrust with whether Xcel will actually do what’s required, which I haven’t heard very often in my practice all over the United States, and you don’t often hear commissioners just outright question whether the utility will even comply with their order.”

Stanfield also highlights additional comments from Commissioner Gilman:

“Commissioner Gilman expressed a particular concern about whether Xcel is going to comply with the order this time and set forth a process that would allow staff to do an investigation and pursue penalties if they don’t, but she questioned openly whether that would even be effective, which is a really troubling place to be.”

Xcel’s motivations for non-complicance are certainly called into question when the utility faces further delays in building out energy infrastructure.

Stanfield notes, “If Xcel does not take into account managed charging and the ability of DERs to respond to grid conditions and be ‘flexible,’ that results in a need for more distribution upgrades, which means the ratepayers have to pay for more distribution upgrades, and the shareholders get a greater profit every time they build what’s called a capital investment.”

Adding, “So were they motivated? Are they not motivated to enable the flexibility of the DERs because their shareholders don’t get as much of a profit? That’s the question that I think the commission was grappling with in this proceeding, overall.”

Our colleagues at PV-Tech first reported on this story, noting that financial mechanisms, like flexible tariffs for grids where renewable energy is an increasingly integral part of meeting energy demand, can also minimise the cost of a mismatch between electricity supply and demand.

This may be especially important for Xcel in Colorado, where the utility has actively worked to boost renewable energy’s share in its overall mix in recent years. From 2005 to 2024, wind power’s contribution to the energy supplied to customers grew from 2% to 35%. Xcel anticipates this will rise to 62% by the end of the decade.

Colorado ranks eighth in the nation for energy storage capacity, sixth for wind energy and tenth for solar energy, making the integration of these sources into the grid a crucial aspect of energy management.

In a 2022 guest blog for ESN Premum, Gwen Brown, Vice President of Communications for IREC, wrote:

“Energy storage is a critical piece of the puzzle in the transition to an electric grid powered by high levels of renewable energy. Storage makes it possible to capture the intermittent power produced by DERs like solar and wind and use it when it is most needed.”

Brown continued, “However, many of the most valuable characteristics of storage can’t easily be utilised on the distribution grid today. That’s because most state-level interconnection rules—the rules that govern whether and how DERs are permitted to connect to the grid—have not been updated to deal with energy storage systems in a way that maximises customer flexibility and ensures the continued safe and reliable operation of the grid.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-135248.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:59:06.786124

From 2025 to 2030, peak needs may grow by as little as 103 GW or as much as 197 GW.","Energy policy debates often sound like a choice among competing visions of which type of energy would best power America’s future: “dispatchable,” on-demand power produced from fossil fuels and nuclear energy, or quick-build, cheap energy from renewables such as wind and solar?

If only our choice was that simplistic. The reality, however, is that between now and 2030, surging demand for energy will collide with longstanding bottlenecks on new capacity. This mismatch between supply and demand stands to limit how much energy the grid can deliver to build homes, create jobs, support national security, drive the economy — everything we count on energy to do. Meanwhile, competitors such as China are able to rapidly bring new capacity online for data centers and other economic and security imperatives.

The math is unforgiving: Neither dispatchables nor renewables will come close to meeting our needs on their own. We’ll need them all. We already do need them all. A look at the data behind electricity supply and demand shows just how clear-eyed and nimble we’ll need to be to achieve “grid dominance” — that is, ensuring that our power grid is equipped to meet our constantly expanding needs.

Destination: Grid dominance

Abundant electricity hinges on two elements: energy and power. The terms are often used interchangeably, but they represent different things. It’s important to understand the difference in order to understand what energy grid dominance entails.

“Power” refers to the electricity that we use from moment to moment — to turn on the lights, ramp up the factory floor, bring military-base control systems online, and so on.

“Energy,” on the other hand, is what keeps the power going for the period of time that it’s needed — to keep the lights on, the factory output humming, the military base running.

One way to think of it is to visualize a delivery truck hauling goods from a factory to a warehouse 100 miles away, along a route with rises and dips, some high hills and steep grades, and long, flat stretches of roadway, as in the illustration:

The truck will need a strong motor — the power — to make it up the hills and grades, and enough fuel — energy — to make the 100-mile trip from factory to warehouse and back. The delivery truck represents the power grid, fueled by the power plants connected today and those in development to be connected within the next five years.

“The grid,” it should be noted, is not a single entity, but a nationwide network of power plants, substations, power lines, and other components that convert raw energy into electricity, and then transmit it to homes, businesses, and other end users.

As for the rest of the illustration:

the road is the demand curve over the next five years

the hills are estimates of peak demand

the distance is the total energy needed to reach the destination

And the destination is grid dominance by 2030: an electrical grid that can keep up with a growing economy, including the escalating demand for power from data centers and industrial loads.

Delivering grid dominance requires delivering both power and energy, and we’re right on track … to fall short on both: The truck can’t get up the highest hill, and it won’t make it to the warehouse.

Part 1: Power up the peaks

On July 29, 2025, America’s electrical grid delivered 760 gigawatts of power throughout the lower 48 states. It was a record for peak demand, or the maximum amount of power needed at once to keep the lights on. And yet, experts project that over the next five years, we’ll keep setting records for peak demand.

How much bigger will the peaks be in 2030? Because demand is expanding every year, the delivery truck needs to climb higher hills every year. Here we focus on the additional power that we’ll need on top of the 760 GW the grid is already providing. From 2025 to 2030, peak needs may grow by as little as 103 GW or as much as 197 GW. But we estimate that only about 118 GW of extra power plant capacity will be connected to the grid and available at peak moments over this period, based on power facilities that are already far enough along the intensive and overly time-consuming permitting process.

So if demand growth is on the low end of the estimates, then the grid would be able to deliver power dominance — enough supply to meet peak demands.

At least theoretically. If we’re counting on one source of energy to get the job done, the illustration below shows the literally darker reality:

The combination of natural gas and nuclear capacity (“dispatchable” energy shown in the chart) would account for only 37 GW, a fraction of the total amount needed and far short of even the low end of the demand range. Wind and solar projects would contribute another 26 GW during demand peaks. The remaining 55 GW would come from electricity-storage projects and various hybrid power plants, such as solar paired with lithium-ion batteries.

Part 2: On the energy side, (not) going the distance

That’s the picture on the power side during peak demand. On the energy side, when we look at projections for cumulative electricity consumption throughout an entire year rather than only at peak moments, we also see additional demand growth ranging widely, from 449 terawatt-hours (i.e., 449,000 gigawatt-hours) to 855 terawatt-hours through 2030. That’s all new demand on top of current demand.

The chart below makes clear how far off we may be from meeting our growing energy needs over the next five years, even when all sources are combined.

The contributions to annual electricity supply from various production technologies are different from those for meeting the limited hours of peak demand. For example, battery storage on its own produces nothing and therefore doesn’t contribute to annual production, but it can help provide power during peak demand. On the flip side, wind availability is higher on average over the year than it is at peak, so it’s an essential tool for meeting our energy needs throughout the year. As another example, dispatchable sources make up almost half of expected annual production additions, more than their share of peak supply additions.

In other words, a given technology can have high value on the power side but low value on the energy side and vice versa, or medium value on both, for instance. This underscores why a diversity of technologies makes for the strongest grid.

Most importantly, the fundamental takeaway from the power side holds true here on the energy side as well: Excluding any given technology in the existing project-development queue would prevent us from keeping pace with additional electricity demand, even in the low-growth scenarios.

The inescapable point is that energy strategies that reject a balanced mix of sources won’t be enough to keep up with growth. We need to stop choosing among energy types and start embracing America’s energy-dominance potential.

In the next installment of our series on driving America’s energy future, we will examine practical strategies for leveraging readily available supplies to address accelerating demand.

The new jobs will pay an average wage of $55,133, slightly higher than the current average wage of $49,335 in Randolph County.

The state will incentivize EAS about $5 million total, including almost $3.3 million in a Job Development Investment Grant, $1.2 million in workforce training and a $500,000 building re-use grant. EAS will locate in a 300,000-square-foot manufacturing space to serve regional and national markets. There are three total buildings on the site, totaling about 450,000 square feet and EAS is expected to use all three, says Kevin Franklin, president of Randolph County Economic Development.

The building has been used for warehousing for the past several years. Klaussner Home Furnishings last used the building for manufacturing in 2023. Klaussner shut down in 2023, eliminating more than 800 jobs across several sites in Asheboro.

“We’re very excited to see it get back into productive use,” says Franklin.

EAS has operated in the Triad region since 1953, and was acquired by Comfort Systems in 2016. Comfort Systems became a public company in 1997 with 12 operating companies. It now has 45 companies and 18,000 employees in more than 170 U.S. locations/

EAS has 831 employees in North Carolina across seven locations. Asheboro beat out sites in Danville, Virginia, and Rock Hill, South Carolina. Franklin says it helped that Asheboro is only 25 miles south of EAS headquarters in High Point, as well as an available labor pool. Having an available site was also a major factor, he adds.

At a time when Attorney General Sunday and some Pennsylvania legislative leaders are taking action to combat the safety risks associated with modern technology, U.S. Congress appears poised to pass a provision that would strip states of the ability to regulate A.I. and take enforcement action against those who use it to cause harm.

This week, Attorney General Sunday joined 36 Attorneys General in a letter to Congress opposing federal preemption of state laws. AG Sunday joined a coalition with a similar message earlier this year.

“I am again joining many colleagues in urging Congress to allow states to continue on with the great progress we are making to protect children, families, and communities from the dangers of artificial intelligence,” Attorney General Sunday said. “We continue to charge offenders who use A.I. to exploit and abuse children and unsuspecting adults by manipulating images and sharing them online — an enforcement tool made possible by our state Legislature. Our legislative leaders continue to work on additional bills that will strengthen protections from dangerous uses of technology.”

Among those bills are:

SB1050: Requiring mandated reporting of child sexual abuse material, including artificially-generated CSAM.

HB1925: Regarding regulation of A.I. in healthcare.

The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General has charged at least six individuals with felony counts under Act 125, which was passed into law by the state Legislature in December 2024. That law prohibits the use of artificial intelligence technology to create materials that appear to “authentically depict a child under 18” engaging in sexually abusive acts that did not occur in reality.

“Now we can say ‘yes’ to clean energy because it’s actually affordable for many people.” McKibben expressed optimism about the clean energy revolution despite the pace not moving fast enough to offset the damaging impacts of climate change.
“But they are also very excited about the rapid progress of clean energy.
At the same time, something else can be true, which is that we’re seeing incredible opportunity and momentum in the clean energy space and in the social sector.
Isham said he hoped to see the cost of clean energy continue to decline or a new technology emerge that would make these advancements accessible to those who cannot afford them.","Students, faculty, and alumni gathered at the What Works Now? conference, held November 15–17 at Middlebury College, to reflect on the positive environmental outcomes sparked by the inaugural gathering 20 years ago, and to consider strategies for addressing today’s climate challenges.

The event drew alumni from across the nation—some of whom organized the original conference as part of a winter term course taught by Jon Isham, professor of economics and environmental studies, titled What Works: Building a New Climate Movement. They spoke about the course’s transformative impact, crediting it with the creation of the Sunday Night Environmental Group (SNEG) and eventual founding of nonprofit 350.org as well as the Keystone Pipeline protests, the College’s decision to divest from fossil fuels, and other environmental milestones. These significant accomplishments were captured in a historical timeline created by Ella Powers ’27 and shared at the conference.

Keynote speaker Jamie Henn ‘07, cofounder of 350.org and executive director of Fossil Free Media, said the class and the community formed through it defined his life and career for the next 20 years “through Sunday Night Group, 350.org, my work with Bill McKibben (Schumann Distinguished Scholar), and many here in the room.”

“In many ways this feels like a homecoming, but also a continuation of being back in the same J-term class that Jon has continued on and on for the last 20 years. We’re still figuring out ‘what works.’”

Henn and other alumni who participated on panels, breakout sessions, and climate conversations emphasized the importance of empowering current students like Powers—co-organizer of the conference and treasurer of SNEG—to lead the next generation of climate action efforts at the College. “I’m so glad that Ella is looking back at history because all the work began long before 2005,” said Henn. “Coming out of that first class we really took inspiration from the generation before us. We walked out of 2005 with a real sense that there was a movement out there that we could activate.”

Powers was equally optimistic.

“We’ve done this for 20 years and looked at what’s worked and what hasn’t, and now we’re reassessing,” said Powers, who interviewed dozens of alumni for her history project. “There are really awesome, cool alums who have done things that I can’t really imagine, but it’s also really cool to be in the footsteps of that, and know that there is the potential to do something great like they did. We need to take the lessons and trials of the past, learn from them, and apply them to the fight today.”

New Era, Similar Issues

Some speakers expressed frustration at confronting many of the same climate issues that defined the original conference—issues highlighted in The New York Times front-page story “Paper Sets Off a Debate on Environmentalism’s Future,” based on a presentation at the 2005 conference by emerging environmentalists Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus titled “The Death of Environmentalism.” They also drew comparisons between the fossil-fuel–driven policies of the George W. Bush administration and current efforts to roll back clean-energy incentives and weaken foundational environmental laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act.

Isham called the comparison a “fair assessment” with one major exception: the cost of clean energy. “There’s a sense that environmentalists are back on their heels like 20 years ago,” he said, “but we actually have the ace of spades in our hands, which is that clean energy is much cheaper and accounted for 90 percent of new energy sources in 2024.”

In 2005, Isham said climate activists spent their time pushing back against the exorbitant cost of clean energy by proposing things like carbon taxes to incentivize businesses and consumers to use less carbon-intensive energy products. “Today, as Bill McKibben explains in his new book, Here Comes the Sun, the opposite is true—the things that environmentalists support and know to be better for the planet, like wind, solar, and storage, are far less expensive,” he said. “Now we can say ‘yes’ to clean energy because it’s actually affordable for many people.”

McKibben expressed optimism about the clean energy revolution despite the pace not moving fast enough to offset the damaging impacts of climate change.

“Around the world, people are very worried about climate, as they should be,” he said. “But they are also very excited about the rapid progress of clean energy. The planet is getting a third more power from the sun this fall than it did last fall, so things are starting to shift. Fast enough to catch up with the physics of climate change? No—and that’s the scary part.”

The Role of the College

The timing of What Works Now? coincided with the 60th anniversary of the College’s first-in-the-nation environmental studies program, along with the completion of Energy2028 drawing near, the temporary suspension of operations by 350.org, and a Strategic Planning Initiative to guide the College over the next decade and beyond.

During the keynote conversation on November 14, President Ian Baucom asked Henn about some of these issues and whether he struggled to remain optimistic with the sometimes stark realities around climate change.

“Climate is an interesting thing because you tend to toggle between the most apocalyptic, darkest feelings of ‘nothing is going to work out,’ and then these incredible hopeful horizons of possibility of thinking that this is an issue and a lens to look at the world and rethink everything around you,” said Henn to an audience of alumni, faculty, and students in Wilson Hall. “It’s a combination of those two that makes it so emotionally powerful.”

Henn said Isham’s class provided what he called a “sense of the radical stakes that we were facing, but then the freedom that gives you to kind of rethink everything was really exciting and electrifying.”

Baucom asked Henn if the phrase “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will,” attributed to the Italian Marxist philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci, resonates in the context of climate change. “There’s a certain necessary pessimism—you’ve got to face the hard facts—and yet find grounds for optimism,” said Baucom. “Where can we find optimism of the intellect and optimism of the will when it comes to climate?”

On the optimistic side, Henn pointed to the current clean-energy revolution.

“We’ve really done the job of unlocking the incredible possibility of repowering this planet without fossil fuels,” he said. Regarding the pessimism of the will, he added, “I don’t think we have to sugarcoat the threat to our democracy and especially marginalized communities in this country. At the same time, something else can be true, which is that we’re seeing incredible opportunity and momentum in the clean energy space and in the social sector. The job of the activist is to look where there might be momentum.”

What Will Work in 2045?

Toward the end of the event, participants were asked which issues they anticipated would dominate the 2045 What Works Now? conference. Isham said he hoped to see the cost of clean energy continue to decline or a new technology emerge that would make these advancements accessible to those who cannot afford them.

“I’d like to see new technologies to liberate the unliberated, the poor, and the people who are struggling now in this country and beyond to pay rent, to buy a car, to hold on to their jobs,” he said. “That would be something to celebrate—if the climate movement has further uplifted everybody.”",https://www.middlebury.edu/announcements/themes/custom/middlebury_theme/favicon.ico?fv=8mh0Lypp,N,,2025-11-25 17:01:31.905465

READ MORE: Wind power plays tiny role in North Carolina’s grid, could that be changing?

The state’s second wind farm opened last year, which was the newest addition providing power to 28,000 homes while providing an economic boost to Chowan County.

On Tuesday, Timbermill Wind’s developers, Apex Clean Energy, presented local leaders with its first property tax payment, nearly $750,000.

“We’re paying as much in property taxes this year as the top nine taxpayers combined in 2024,” said spokesman Brian O’Shea.

The project includes 45 wind turbines operating on land shared with a soybean, corn and cotton farm as well as forested property for timber harvest. O’Shea explains the turbines are tall enough most of the land can still be used for agricultural purposes while it’s leased out to Apex.

“You know, with commodity prices and trade policy has really, you know, made life difficult for for American farmers, and wind energy is just one other lifeline for those farmers to be able to have some income they can depend on regardless of what’s going on in the global economy.”

Last year, Channel 9 was at the event as a bipartisan group of state leaders celebrated the construction of North Carolina’s second wind farm, Timbermill Wind.

It took nearly 11 years to permit and build Timbermill Wind. The only previous wind development, Amazon Wind in Edenton, was built nearly 10 years earlier.

O’Shea said new permitting rules allowed Timbermill to get off the ground and set the stage for further projects, hopefully with a quicker timeline.

“We were the first project ever to go through that new state process and navigate it,” he said then. “So, now there’s at least a roadmap for a future developer.”

However, the winds shifted a year later.

Federal policy has made it harder to get the permits necessary to build new wind power and expiring tax credits mean new projects would be more expensive.

In its 2024 iteration of its long term plan, Duke Energy planned to have wind generation on its grid by 2033. In the edition of the plan released this year, the utility is not expecting to add any wind projects to the grid for the next 15 years.

“It’s not economically viable to at least the 2040s,” said Bill Norton, a Duke Energy spokesman.

Karly Brownfield with the Southeastern Wind Coalition said this plan misses out on the potential the state has on and offshore to develop clean power while relying too heavily on coal and gas power.

“We see natural gas prices go up and down. We see utilities become more dependent on natural gas,” she said. “There’s a really great opportunity for wind to provide kind of a natural hedge against those prices.”

As evidence, Brownfield points to other southeastern utilities still moving forward on wind development, including neighboring Dominion Energy, which recently released a request for proposals for wind in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.

“It’s kind of a very sharp contrast between how different utilities are are kind of digesting all this uncertainty,” she said.

As the Carolinas face steep increases in energy demand over the next decade, Brownfield believes it’s not time to rule out a home-grown source of power.

“Whether you’re approaching that from an energy security perspective, if you’re thinking about the economic benefit for rural landowners or communities just meeting energy demand and load growth,” Brownfield said. “there are a lot of ways that wind is still applicable.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/wsoc_cox_articles_386/7e749086a8b2ea924d58c985dbcceaaa,N,,2025-11-25 17:04:08.156283

This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.","Oregonians have just more than a month to take advantage of federal tax credits meant to reduce by thousands of dollars the costs of buying and installing new energy efficient heating and cooling pumps, insulation, windows and solar panels.

Paired with incentives from the nonprofit, state-partnered Energy Trust of Oregon, the savings can cover half to nearly all costs, depending on the purchase. People who have made home energy efficiency upgrades this year, or who can complete upgrades by Dec. 31, can claim the federal tax credits.

Most of the federal credits passed in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted under former President Joe Biden and were meant to expire in 2032, giving Americans a decade to take advantage of subsidies meant to spur investments in home weatherizing and clean energy upgrades. But congressional Republicans phased the credits out early in the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

Julianne Thacher, a spokesperson for the Energy Trust, said the organization wants to encourage Oregonians to take advantage of those credits now and to remind them that when they go away, there will still be state-level incentives they should not overlook.

“Energy Trust incentives will be here after the tax credits. We won’t be affected. We were here before the tax credits, and had very successful programs with folks installing energy-efficient equipment, so we expect that will continue,” Thacher said.

The Oregon Department of Energy also offers solar and heat pump cash incentives and grants that can be used towards the costs of equipment and installation after federal, Energy Trust and any other incentives are applied.

The Oregon Energy Trust was established by the state Public Utilities Commission in 2002. Although it’s an independent nonprofit, the commission oversees the trust’s performance measures, budget and planning.

Ratepayers of five of Oregon’s six investor-owned gas and electric utilities — all except Idaho Power — fund the trust. As part of utilities’ energy load planning, they send a percentage of ratepayer dollars to the trust, which is tasked with ensuring investment in activities that lower overall load demand and help meet state climate targets.

Part of that is standing up cash incentive programs to help businesses and everyday Oregonians afford equipment and infrastructure to lower their own energy consumption. The trust offers higher incentives for families with lower incomes and collaborates with 60 community organizations statewide.

Energy Trust incentives are available to all customers of Portland General Electric, or PGE, Pacific Power, NW Natural, Cascade Natural Gas and Avista. Customers can go to a store and choose equipment prequalified for Energy Trust incentives, and that will deduct the credit from receipt at the point of purchase.

Customers can also work with contractors who have agreements with Energy Trust, and who will purchase and install the equipment and deduct the tax credits from the bill. Customers can also apply online at the Energy Trust’s website for specific credits after purchase, and receive a refund for the credit amount in the mail.

The mix of state, federal and private and nonprofit subsidies for solar panels have led to major growth in residential solar in the last decade, and today about 25,000 homeowners in Oregon are generating solar energy, according to Energy Trust. This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.

“The solar contractors we work with are very busy right now, and we’ve actually gone ahead and launched our new incentives for 2026 early, because folks who are looking to do a solar project starting now, they’re highly unlikely to complete that by year’s end. That’ll be a 2026 project.”

Focusing on efficiency in businesses and homes in Oregon, and setting climate targets that incorporate more solar, heat and cooling pumps and building upgrades, has made a big dent in Oregon’s gas and electricity use. Demand for gas would today be 9% higher and demand for electricity 16% higher if policies had not been enacted over the last two decades, the Trust found.

“Energy efficiency is the most effective, affordable way to meet climate goals, while also offering a ton of other benefits for customers and communities,” Thacher said.

At the dawning of the British Empire in 1818, the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned a memorable sonnet freighted with foreboding about the inevitable decline of all empires, whether in ancient Egypt or then-modern Britain.

In Shelly’s stanzas, a traveler in Egypt comes across the ruins of a once-monumental statue, with “a shattered visage lying half sunk” in desert sands bearing the “sneer of cold command.” Only its “trunkless legs of stone” remain standing. Yet the inscription carved on those stones still proclaims: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” And in a silent mockery of such imperial hubris, all the trappings of that awesome power, all the palaces and fortresses, have been utterly erased, leaving only a desolation “boundless and bare” as “the lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Taken too literally, those verses might lead us to anticipate some future traveler finding fragments of St. Paul’s Cathedral scattered on the banks of the Thames River in London or stones from the Washington Monument strewn in a kudzu-covered field near the Potomac. Shelley is, however, offering us a more profound lesson that every empire teaches and every imperialist then forgets: Imperial ascent begets an inevitable decline.

Imperial Washington

Indeed, these days Donald Trump’s Washington abounds with monuments to overblown imperial grandeur and plans for more, all of which add up to an unconvincing denial that America’s global imperium is facing an Ozymandias-like fate. With his future Gilded Age ballroom meant to rise from the rubble of the White House’s East Wing, his plans for a massive triumphal arch at the city’s entrance, and a military parade of tanks and troops clanking down Constitution Avenue on his birthday, who could ever imagine such a thing? Not Donald Trump, that’s for sure.

In a celebration of his “works” that are supposedly making the “mighty despair” in foreign capitals around the world, his former national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has recently argued in Foreign Affairs that the president’s “policy of peace through strength” is reversing a Democrat-induced decline of U.S. global power. According to O’Brien, instead of crippling NATO (as his critics claim), President Trump is “leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era”; unleashing military innovation “to counter China”; and proving himself the “indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to… long-standing disputes” in Gaza, the Congo, and, quite soon, Ukraine as well. Even in North America, according to O’Brien, Trump’s attempt to acquire Greenland has forced Denmark to expand its military presence, putting Russia on notice that the West will compete for control of the Arctic.

As it happens, whatever the truth of any of that may be, the policy elements that O’Brien cites are certain to prove largely irrelevant to the ceaseless struggle for geopolitical power among the globe’s great empires. Or, to borrow a favorite Trumpian epithet from the president’s “cornucopia of crudeness,” in the relentless, often ruthless world of grand strategy, none of those factors amounts to a hill of “shit.”

Indeed, O’Brien’s epic catalogue of Trump’s supposed foreign policy successes cleverly avoids any mention of the central factor in the rise and fall of every dominant world power for the past 500 years: energy. While the United States made genuine strides toward a green energy revolution under President Joe Biden, his successor, the “drill, baby, drill” president, has seemed determined not just to destroy those gains, but to revert to dependence on fossil fuels “bigly,” as Trump would say. In a perplexing paradox, President Trump’s systematic attack on alternative energy at home will almost certainly subvert America’s geopolitical power abroad. How and why? Let me explain by dipping my toes in a bit of history.

For the past five centuries, the rise of every global empire has rested on an underlying transformation (or perhaps revolution would be a more accurate word for it) in the form of energy that drove its version of the world economy. Innovation in the basic force behind its rising global presence gave each successive hegemonic power — Portugal, Spain, England, the United States, and possibly now China — a critical competitive advantage, cutting costs and increasing profits. That energy innovation and the lucrative commerce it created infused each successive imperium with intangible but substantial power, impelling its armed forces relentlessly forward and crushing resistance to its rule, whether by local groups or would-be imperial rivals. Although scholars of imperial history often ignore it, energy should be considered, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, the determinative factor in the rise and fall of every global hegemon for the past five centuries.

Iberia’s Mastery of Muscle

In the fifteenth century, the Iberian powers — Portugal and Spain — manipulated the ocean winds and maximized the energy output of the human body, giving them new forms of energy that allowed their arid lands and limited populations to conquer much of the globe. By replacing the square sail of lumbering Mediterranean ships with a triangular sail, agile Portuguese vessels like the famed caravela de armada doubled their capacity to tack close to the wind, allowing them to master the world’s oceans.

By 1500, Portuguese warships had navigation instruments that allowed them to cross the widest bodies of water, sails to beat into the strongest headwinds, a sturdy hull for guns and cargo, and lethal cannons that could destroy enemy fleets or breach the walls of port cities. As a result, a small flotilla of Portuguese caravels soon conquered colonies on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean and seized control of Asian sea lanes from the Red Sea to the Java Sea.

For the next three centuries, such sailing ships would transport 11 million African captives across the Atlantic to work as slaves in a new form of agriculture that was both exceptionally cruel and extraordinarily profitable: the sugar plantation. The output of Europe’s free yeoman farmers was then constrained by the limits of the individual body and the temperate climate’s short six-month growing season. By contrast, enslaved laborers, massed into efficient teams in tropical latitudes, were driven year-round to the brink of death and beyond to extract unprecedented productivity and profits from those plantations. Indeed, even as late as the nineteenth century, the U.S. southern slave plantation was, according to an econometric analysis, 35% more efficient than a northern family farm.

After developing the sugar plantation, or fazenda, as a new form of agribusiness on small islands off the coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese brought that system to Brazil in the sixteenth century. From there, it migrated to European colonies in the Caribbean, making that cruel commerce synonymous with the slave trade for nearly four centuries. So profitable was the slave plantation for its owners that, unlike almost every other form of production, it did not die from natural economic causes but would instead require the full force of the British navy to do it in.

The Dutch Harness the Winds

But the true masters of wind power would prove to be the Dutch, whose technological prowess would allow their small land, devoid of natural resources, to conquer a colonial empire that spanned three continents. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch drive for scientific innovation led them to harness the winds as never before, building sailing ships 10 times the size of a Portuguese caravel and windmills that, among other things, replaced the tedious hand sawing of logs to produce lumber for shipbuilding. With giant sails spanning over 90 feet, a five-ton shaft generating up to 50 horsepower, and several sawing frames with six steel blades each, a windmill’s four-man crew could turn 60 tree trunks a day into uniform planks to maintain the massive Dutch merchant fleet of 4,000 ocean-going ships.

By 1650, the Zaan district near Amsterdam, arguably Europe’s first major industrial area, had more than 50 wind-driven sawmills and was the world’s largest shipyard, launching 150 hulls annually (at half the cost of English-built vessels). Many of these were the Dutch-designed fluitschip, an agile three-masted cargo vessel that cut crew size, doubled sailing speed, and could carry 500 tons of cargo with exceptional efficiency.

Through its commercial acumen and mastery of wind power, tiny Holland defeated the mighty Spanish empire in the Thirty Years War (1618-48), then fought the British to a standstill in three massive naval wars, while building an empire that reached around the world — from the Spice Islands of Indonesia to the city of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan.

When Coal Was King

As Holland’s commercial empire began to fade, however, Great Britain was already launching an energy transition to coal-fired steam energy that would leave the wind and muscle power of the Iberian age in the dust of history. And the industrial revolution that went with it would build the world’s first truly global empire.

The Scottish inventor James Watt perfected the steam engine by 1784. Such machines began driving railways in 1825 and the Royal Navy’s warships in the 1840s. By then, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide — driving sawmills, pulling gang plows, and sculpting the earth’s surface with steam shovels, steam dredges, and steam rollers. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States would triple from 56,000 units to 156,000, accounting for 77% of all American industrial power. To fuel that age of steam and steel, Britain’s coal production climbed to a peak of 290 million tons in 1913, while worldwide production reached 1.3 billion tons.

Coal was the catalyst for an industrial revolution that fused steam technology with steel production to make Britain the master of the world’s oceans. From the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tiny Britain with just 40 million people would preside over a global empire that controlled a quarter of all humanity directly through colonies and another quarter indirectly through client states. In addition to its vast territorial empire, Britannia ruled the world’s waves, while its pound sterling became the global reserve currency, and London the financial center of the planet.

America’s Petrol-Powered Hegemony

Just as Britain’s imperial age had coincided with its coal-driven industrial revolution, so Washington’s brand-new world order focused on crude oil to feed the voracious energy needs of its global economy. By 1950, in the wake of World War II, the U.S. petrol-powered economy was producing half the world’s economic output and using that raw economic power for commercial and military dominion over most of the planet (outside the Sino-Soviet communist bloc).

By 1960, the Pentagon had built a nuclear triad that gave it a formidable strategic deterrent, as five nuclear-powered submarines armed with atomic warheads trolled the ocean depths, while 14 nuclear-armed aircraft carriers patrolled the world’s oceans. Flying from 500 U.S. overseas military bases, the Strategic Air Command had 1,700 bombers ready for nuclear strikes.

As American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 200 million in 2000, the country’s oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million. During those same decades, the federal government spent $370 billion to cover the country with 46,000 miles of interstate highways, allowing cars and trucks to replace railroads as the ribs of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.

To drive the carbon-fueled economy of Washington’s world order, there would be a dramatic, five-fold increase in the global consumption of liquid fossil fuels during the last half of the twentieth century. As the number of motor vehicles worldwide kept climbing, crude oil rose from 27% of global fossil-fuel consumption in 1950 to 44% by 2003, surpassing coal to become the world’s main source of energy.

To meet this relentlessly rising demand, the Middle East’s share of global oil production climbed from just 7% in 1945 to 35% in 2003. As the self-appointed guardian of the Persian Gulf whose vast oil reserves represented some 60% of the world’s total, Washington would become embroiled in endless wars in that tumultuous region, from the Gulf War of 1990-91 to its present-day interventions in Israel and Iran.

Whether thanks to Britain’s coal-fired factories or America’s auto traffic, all those carbon emissions were already producing signs of global warming that, by the 1990s, would set alarm bells ringing among scientists worldwide. From the “pre-industrial” baseline of 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1880, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere kept climbing to 410 ppm by 2018, resulting in the rising seas, devastating fires, raging storms, and protracted droughts that came to be known as global warming.

As evidence of the climate crisis became undeniable, the world’s nations responded with striking unanimity by signing the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to cut carbon emissions and surge investments into alternative energy that soon yielded significant breakthroughs in both cost and efficiency. Within four years, the International Energy Agency predicted that dramatic drops in the cost of solar panels meant that solar energy would soon be “the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Indeed, as technology slashed the cost of battery storage and solar panels, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2024 that the solar generation of electricity had become 41% cheaper than fossil fuels, while offshore wind was 53% cheaper — a truly significant disparity that will, as technology continues to slash the cost of solar energy, render the use of coal and natural gas for electricity an economic irrationality, if not an utter absurdity.

In the game of empires, seemingly small margins can have large consequences, often marking the difference between dominance and subordination, success and failure — whether the 35% advantage of enslaved over free labor, the 50% cost advantage for Dutch sailing craft over British ones, and now a 41% savings for solar over fossil fuels. Moreover, the day is fast coming when fossil-fuel electricity will cost more than twice as much as alternative energy from solar and wind power.

To assure America’s economic future, the administration of President Joe Biden began investing trillions of dollars in alternative energy by building battery plants, encouraging massive wind and solar projects, and continuing a consumer subsidy to sustain Detroit’s transition to electric vehicles. In January 2025, however, Donald Trump entered the White House (again) determined to roll back the global green revolution. After quitting the Paris climate accord and labeling climate change a “hoax” or “the green new scam,” President Trump has halted construction of major offshore wind projects, ended the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, and opened yet more federal lands for coal and oil leases. Armed with extraordinary executive powers and a single-minded determination, he will predictably delay, if not derail, America’s transition to alternative energy, missing market opportunities and undercutting the country’s economic competitiveness by chaining it to overpriced fossil fuels.

China’s Green-Energy Ride to Global Power

While Washington was demolishing America’s green energy infrastructure, Beijing has been working to make China a global powerhouse for alternative energy. Ten years ago, its leaders launched a “Made in China 2025” program to storm the heights of the global economy by becoming the world leader in 10 strategic industries, eight of which involved some aspect of the green-energy transformation, including “new materials,” “high-tech ships,” “advanced railways,” “energy-saving and new energy vehicles,” and “energy equipment.” Those “new materials” include China’s virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, which are absolutely critical to the manufacturing of the key components for renewable energy — specifically, wind turbines, solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and hydrogen extraction. In sum, Beijing is already riding the green energy revolution in a serious bid to become the world’s “leading manufacturing superpower” by 2049, while erasing America’s economic edge and its global hegemony in the bargain.

So, you might ask, have any of those seemingly pie-in-the-sky plans already become an economic reality? Given China’s recent progress in key energy sectors, the answer is a resounding yes.

Under its economic plan, China has already come to dominate the world’s solar power industry. In 2024, it cut the wholesale price of its solar panel exports in half and nearly doubled its exports of panel components. To replace its old export “trio” of clothing, furniture, and appliances, Beijing has mandated a “new trio” of solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric cars. And to put what’s happening in perspective, imagine that, in just the month of May, China installed enough wind and solar energy to power a country as big as Poland, reaching an impressive figure that represents half the world’s “total installed solar capacity.” By 2024, China was already producing at least 80% of the world’s solar panel components, dominating the global market, and undercutting would-be competitors in Europe and the U.S. Driving all that explosive growth, China’s investment in clean energy has reached nearly $2 trillion, representing 10% of its gross domestic product, and has been growing at three times the rate of its overall economy, meaning it would soon account for a full 20% of its entire economy.

With similar determination, its electric vehicles (EVs) are now beginning to capture the global car market. By 2024, 17.3 million electric cars were made worldwide, and China produced 70% of them. Not only are Chinese companies opening massive robotic assembly plants worldwide to crank out such cars by the millions, but they are also making the world’s cheapest and best cars — with the YangWang U9-X hitting a world speed record of 308 miles per hour; BYD’s latest plug-in hybrid models, priced at only $13,700 and capable of traveling a record 1,200 miles on a single charge and single tank of gas; the YangWang U8 with a capacity to literally drive across water; and the Xiaomi SU-7 displaying a high-tech driver interface that makes a Tesla look like a Ford Pinto.

Since an EV is just a steel box with a battery, technology will soon allow low-cost electric vehicles to completely eradicate gas guzzlers, enabling China to conquer the global car market — with full electric cars like the self-driving BYD Seagull sedan already priced at $8,000, models like BYD’s Han with a 5-minute charge time that’s faster than pumping a tank of gas, and sedans like the Nio ET7 with a standard range on a single charge of 620 miles. And most of that extraordinary technological progress has happened in less than four years, essentially the time remaining in Donald Trump’s second term in office.

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future

By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable. Amid an historic transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure (comparable in scope and scale to the coal-fired industrial revolution), the United States will spend the next three years under his watch digging coal and burning oil and natural gas, while the rest of the industrial world follows China as it pursues technological innovation to the furthest frontiers of the human imagination. Indeed, the latest annual report from the world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, states bluntly that the transition away from fossil fuels is “inevitable” as the world, “led by a surge in cheap solar power in… the Middle East and Asia,” installs more green energy capacity in the next five years than it has in the last 40 combined.

By the time Donald Trump leaves office in 2029, this country will be distinctly on the imperial decline amid fast-paced changes that will make electric vehicles universal and solar-powered electricity an economic imperative. And just as the Dutch used energy technology to capture their imperial moment in the seventeenth century, so the Chinese will undoubtedly do the same in this century.

After all, how can the United States produce competitive products, even for domestic consumption (much less export), if our costs for energy, the basic component of every economic activity, become double those of our competitors? Simply put, it won’t be possible.

If, however, when Donald Trump’s term in office is done, this country moves quickly to recover its capacity for economic rationality, it should be able to regain some version of its place in the world economy. For once the United States rejoins the green energy revolution, it can use its formidable engineering ingenuity to accelerate the development of this transformative technology — simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions that are choking the planet and securing the livelihoods of average American workers in the bargain.

Now, a major staffing cut at the Justice Department’s environmental section and a federal shutdown that paused inspections leave enforcement at a crossroads. Federal News Network’s Eric White spoke with former EPA Deputy Assistant Administrator Stacey Geis about the resource drain crippling environmental enforcement and whether states can fill the widening gap.

Eric White You know, as far as EPA enforcement, environmental enforcement from a federal perspective, things were kind of on a downward trend already and then with a slight bump. And now the first few months of the Trump administration, DOGE came in, the EPA was certainly on the list of agencies that they felt they could take some action against. What is the state of federal environmental enforcement right now? Let’s begin there.

Stacey Geis I think it’s important to understand the context of your question, meaning what is the state of environmental enforcement been, say, for the last 15 years generally and the landscape we are in right now? Back in, I think it was 2019, but there was a report that was done by Cynthia Giles, who was head of the office of enforcement and compliance assurance at EPA back in the Obama administration. And she went off to Harvard and did a report that showed that the level of significant noncompliance in the United States is surprising. And the numbers are that generally most facilities that have permits to pollute are 25% out of compliance, 25% of those companies are out of compliance with existing laws, regs or permits. And that for the facilities that emit the most hazardous air pollutants, the numbers were up to 50%, 75% noncompliance. So I say it because you’re starting from a place where we have more noncompliance than I think we would all expect. And of course, there could be a lot of reasons for that, including it could be laws that are tough to know how to comply with. So there’s a host of reasons. But I say that because it’s important to then put that into context of where we are now. Back during the Bush administration, Bush II, EPA was doing up to 6,000 enforcement cases a year. And then there was a very big decrease starting in the Obama years, and it just kind of kept going down, where they really decreased resources EPA’s enforcement. And now, you know, when the last administration came in and tried to revitalize EPA, hired hundreds of people, including in the enforcement division, and the numbers started going back up. But still, so in 2024, there were about 1,800 cases, civil enforcement cases that were concluded. So now we are in this, in the last 2025. What we’ve seen is two things. One, a reprioritization of this administration when it comes to what type of enforcement they want to do. And so a lot of folks, including the Department of Justice and the Environmental and Natural Resources Division were, on day one, reassigned to do other things, including immigration. And then of course, there was a whole host of terminations, administrative leaves, people who resigned, and then I think thousands who took the “fork in the road.” So we have an incredible resource drain right now at EPA. We also have it at the Department of Justice, which is obviously the partner that does a lot of the enforcement. So I would say where we are right now is that we will see in December, that’s when EPA has to announce, or generally for the last 10 years has announced, its enforcement results, its annual enforcement results. Meaning: how many civil cases were done, how many criminal cases, how many hundreds of millions of pounds of pollution were removed in the United States because of those enforcement actions? Those numbers will come out in December and it will be very interesting to see what those numbers are compared to prior years.

Eric White Let’s talk a little bit about the manpower aspect of this. What does proper environmental enforcement require? Does it need a lot of attorneys, investigators? I imagine that these aren’t easy cases to make, proving causation and whether or not who is to blame for environmental pollution, that can probably be tough given that it can be hard to obtain hard evidence. Can you just expand upon how, you know, just having workforce cuts in general to environmental enforcement, whether it is EPA or DOJ, and the effect that that just has on environmental enforcement in general.

Stacey Geis There’s federal enforcement, EPA does enforcement, DOJ does. There’s also states that do that, and we can talk about that later in terms of how potentially whether we will see the states gap-filling because of what we think will be a lack of federal enforcement. But going to your question, it is a whole team that exists to put together an enforcement case, and it starts with the inspectors. And those are also part of the Office of Enforcement. So you have inspectors who just routinely go out — like with any regulation, whether it’s OSHA, they go and they inspect the facilities for compliance. It starts there. And that’s one thing, for example, that’s paused during the shutdown, inspections are paused. But it’s the inspections that then are one of the key ways that an agency finds out that a facility may not be in compliance. And then that starts — you may have investigators who come in and start investigating further. You have to have scientists. You have to have hydrologists. You have to have people who know air regulations, who can come in and ascertain whether or not this really non-compliance. What level? Is this something that rises to the level of an enforcement action? And if so, what kind of enforcement action? Is it something that it should be a minor fine and they’re going to fix it? Or is it’s something that’s lying, cheating, stealing, and they are being deceptive, bypassing the pollution scrubber, and you could be looking at a criminal case. So you have inspectors, you have investigators, and then you have all the attorneys both at EPA and the Department of Justice. EPA has its own enforcement program where they do kind of those more minor, what we call administrative enforcement actions, where it’s going to be a fine and course-correcting and getting the company back into compliance. And then if it turns out the violations require a more serious enforcement, whether civil or criminal, it’ll be referred to the Department of Justice. And those Department of Justice attorneys then bring the cases to court. So that’s why the incredible drain we’re seeing in resources at DOJ as well — and I can give you numbers on that, but the environmental section is down, I think 50% to 60% of what it was in January — means understandably less resources to develop the case and less resources prosecute.

Eric White We’re speaking with Stacey Geis. She is a senior counsel with Crowell and Moring, also former deputy assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency. You mentioned something in your first answer regarding how compliance could be tied to … it’s really, really hard to be in compliance, right? Especially when you’re operating a facility that is dealing with a lot of different chemicals. I mean, you know, just forming compliance, sometimes the drain comes from the people that you’re trying to enforce the regulations on, just because they need that expertise in order to reach compliance. Are there enough compliance experts to go around and also, how tough are these regulations to be in compliance? Are certain industries just going to always be having to deal with this?

Stacey Geis That is a question that we could have a whole day on that, in terms of how to craft good regulations that both are easy for the company to understand and comply with and easy to enforce. What I will say, though, is one of the challenges with the shutdown — because people are asking, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean, the industry is facing incredible uncertainty. With the shutdown, what is paused, both at EPA and DOJ, are most enforcement actions. Criminal enforcement actions continue under their various shutdown plans, and it’s always been that way. And there’ll still be enforcement when it comes down to imminent and substantial threats to public harm or the environment. That is a very small subset. One thing that the Office of Enforcement does — it’s called the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, because not only does it enforce the laws, it’s there to provide compliance assistance to the companies, to help them. We want them to comply you, we as a public want companies to comply, right? And we want to have agencies, federal or state, that are assisting them in helping understand those regulations so they can comply. Right now, I don’t know if they called up EPA or one of the regions if they’re going to get the person, because they’re furloughed, to answer those questions. So one thing with this shutdown is not only does it mean that enforcement’s not going forward, but there’s a real uncertainty that the industry is facing right now, too, in terms of their cases aren’t moving forward, they can’t get in touch, they may have compliance questions they cannot get answered. So it actually impacts anyone who is affected by environmental regulations, meaning affected by pollution.

Eric White When you were in your position at EPA, how often were you all paying attention to those numbers? I’m just wondering about, you now, sometimes we can get caught up in, “well, the numbers increase that must mean that everything is on the up and up,” or you know, numbers are down as you had mentioned, when they’re severely down, something is definitely going on. What was the push and pull between quality versus quantity there, as far as the number of enforcement cases that you all were actually pursuing? And how did that factor into your analysis of whether or not you felt you were doing a good enough job or not?

Stacey Geis The question you want to address whenever you’re doing enforcement is going after the most harm, right? And you have limited resources. And then any unlawful violation, but certainly one of like a public and health and safety regulation, which is what pollution regulations really are, is how do you take these limited resources and best use them to enforce laws in a way that will alter behavior going forward, not just that company that may be out of compliance, but the entire industry? And so that is the challenge and always the work you’re doing is, how do you use those resources effectively and efficiently? And so while numbers matter to some extent in terms of showing like exactly what, what cases are being done, how many inspections are being done, there’s certainly a metric by which you want to use it to assess how your programs are going. You also are always looking and doing a harm analysis. Focusing on which of the cases rise to the level of the greatest harm, that maybe a federal response could be needed versus maybe the state could handle it. So that is always the calculus, it’s sort of this balance, right? So it’s never that the numbers mean everything, but that’s why you combine those numbers with, okay, so this is how many cases you prosecuted, this is many civil cases you did … that’s why when they bring the numbers, and that’s why the December numbers will be so important, is they do things like the on the ground metrics. How much pollution was reduced, was cleaned up, because of those enforcement actions? That’s a good metric. And one we’re going to want to look at. Because again, the goal is to abate the harm.

Eric White I don’t want to get you in any trouble, and you can talk as vague as you’d like, but I was wondering if we could maybe get some insight on a particular case. Who was your Al Capone? Who is your white whale that you were able to get one time? Like I said, you don’t have to mention any specifics, but is there anything that you can recall, an insight into what you saw one time and you were to successfully get them either in compliance or successfully prosecute any sort of criminal malfeasance?

Stacey Geis I mean, I can certainly talk about the defeat devices and the sort of “VW-gate” matters — that was where the company was intentionally altering the emissions control to allow the trucks or the vehicles to pollute more than the laws, regulations and permits allowed. And that was a billion-dollar criminal civil case. VW was not the only one. So those cases were still going forward while in the last couple of years. And even in the last year, there was one against Cummins, and this is public, it’s huge, they made all the Ram trucks. I think they paid over $1 billion. And then there was once against Hino, that’s public, that was a criminal-civil matter — they were called the subsidiary of Toyota. But again, those are really big cases where you’re really addressing a systemic issue. And again, bringing those cases, having very high fines, and even some of those cases being criminal is hopefully a deterrent and a message to other companies of, hey, if you’re going to try to unlawfully alter the systems of your software and your cars to pollute beyond what is allowed, that there will be enforcement there. So I think that was almost like a bigger effort that went over years, but that was something that happened in the last couple of years that I think were significant cases.

Eric White And finishing up here, we’ve seen the Trump administration decrease the resources in areas that they feel have too much government oversight in them; CFPB comes to mind. And what I’m feeling is, is that a major Supreme Court case is probably in our future of determining what an executive branch can do and what the threshold is. You know there are environmental laws that say the federal government is responsible for enforcement in this area; at what point do you deplete enough resources where a reasonable person can feel the government is not fulfilling that law? I just was curious about getting your thoughts on that, and if that is in fact in our future of some major case that may set the precedent for that.",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EPA_Coal_Ash_51880-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:59:23.677011

Waste Management recently announced it would accept to-go cups. Rumpke Waste and Recycling has been taking them for two years now. Both companies provide recycling for multiple Indiana cities and towns or offer services like drop-off locations. Hillary Ladig with Rumpke said more demand for these materials has made recycling these cups possible.

“Paper mills kind of put out this announcement that they want cups. Take them in, and let's start recovering this very valuable material that we just simply didn't have a long term home for previously,"" she said.

There's also better technology to sort polypropylene, also known as plastic #5. Some to-go cups are polypropylene, but so are many tubs for things like yogurt, sour cream and imitation butter.

""The robotics in our Cincinnati recycling facility are trained to look for those specific shapes. And over time, as they do more picks or sort that material out more frequently, they become smarter. They learn what to look for,"" Ladig said.

When China decided to no longer accept low-level recycling from the U.S. in 2017, that forced the American recycling industry to innovate. Ladig said Rumpke has always been fortunate to have several manufacturers that can use its recycling in the Midwest.

“But it certainly was a wake up call to those of us in the recycling industry about ensuring long-term, viable recycling programs here domestically and making sure that we are more reliant on end users here at home versus abroad,"" she said.

Check with your local recycling service to make sure they accept to-go cups before throwing them in your recycle bin.

Ladig said all cups should be rinsed. Make sure to pair like materials together. So while a paper sleeve can stay on your paper coffee cup, the plastic lid should be thrown away.

Ladig said straws should go in the trash. Any plastic smaller than a business card likely won't make it through the sorting process.

Those updated standards, finalized in 2024, require a handful of especially poorly controlled power plants to reduce their emissions of mercury as well as arsenic, chromium, and other air toxics.

EPA had earlier invited industries to apply for such exemptions via simple e-mail.

The proclamation applies to coal power plants spread across 23 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

The action follows moves by the administration last week to weaken federal rules protecting millions of acres of wetlands and streams and roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live. In a separate action, the Interior Department proposed new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule last year that imposed strict standards for soot pollution, saying that reducing fine particle matter from motor vehicles and industrial sources could prevent thousands of premature deaths a year.

Twenty-five Republican-led states and a host of business groups filed lawsuits seeking to block the rule in court. A suit led by attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia argued that the EPA rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities and families and could block new manufacturing plants.

In a court filing this week, the EPA essentially took the side of the challengers, saying the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.

“EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule” before Feb. 7, the agency said in a brief filed with the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Vacating the Biden-era rule would revert the soot standard to a level established a dozen years ago under the Obama administration. The Trump EPA is set to propose its own rule early next year.

Environmental groups said the agency’s action — which follows a pledge by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to roll back the soot rule and dozens of other environmental regulations — threatens public health and undermines its obligations under the Clean Air Act.

“EPA’s motion is a blatant attempt to avoid legal requirements for a rollback, in this case for one of the most impactful actions the agency has taken in recent years to protect public health,” said Hayden Hashimoto, an attorney at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force.

EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said the 2024 rule would cost “hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to American citizens if allowed to be implemented.” The rule “was not based on the full analysis of available science that the statute requires,” she said, adding that EPA will conduct a thorough review as required by the Clean Air Act.

The Biden rule set maximum levels of 9 micrograms of fine particle pollution per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms established under former President Barack Obama. The rule sets an air quality level that states and counties must achieve in the coming years to reduce pollution from power plants, vehicles, industrial sites and wildfires.

“An abundance of scientific evidence shows that going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act,” Hashimoto said.

EPA said in creating the rule that the new standard would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits and 4,500 premature deaths, adding up to about $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the rule would especially benefit children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions, as well as those living near highways, factories and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean-air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of healthy communities at Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm that represents environmental groups in the legal case.

President Donald Trump “has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money,” Simms said, adding under Zeldin, the EPA “has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives or serving children, families or communities.”

As solar and wind power generation continues to expand globally, the demand for efficient battery energy storage systems has reached unprecedented levels. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory emphasizes that transformative energy storage solutions require materials that are both high-performing and sustainably sourced.

Battery recycling has emerged as a critical component in developing renewable energy storage infrastructure, providing recycled materials that meet the highest performance standards while reducing environmental impact. The integration of recycled battery materials into renewable energy storage systems represents a significant advancement toward achieving a truly circular economy in clean energy technology.

The Growing Demand for Renewable Energy Storage Systems

Global renewable energy capacity continues to expand at an accelerated pace, with energy storage systems becoming essential for grid stability and reliability. The EPA's renewable energy waste management initiatives highlight the critical need for sustainable end-of-life management of energy storage components as deployment scales increase.

Large-scale battery energy storage systems now store excess electricity generated during peak renewable production periods, releasing it when demand is high or renewable generation is low. These systems require substantial quantities of critical minerals including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Traditional mining operations struggle to meet the growing demand while maintaining sustainable practices, making recycled materials increasingly valuable for renewable energy applications.

The intermittency challenges inherent in solar and wind power generation necessitate sophisticated storage solutions that can respond rapidly to changing grid conditions. Battery energy storage systems provide the flexibility required to integrate variable renewable sources effectively, supporting grid stability while enabling higher renewable penetration levels across electric grids worldwide.

Advanced Battery Recycling Technologies for Energy Storage

Modern battery recycling technologies have evolved to produce materials specifically suited for renewable energy storage applications. GREEN HYDROREJUVENATION™ technology exemplifies these advances, converting spent battery waste directly into battery-grade materials without the energy-intensive processes traditionally required.

The NREL-ACE Green collaboration demonstrates how advanced recycling processes can economically recover materials from various battery chemistries, including lithium iron phosphate batteries commonly used in large-scale energy storage systems. These innovations enable the production of high-purity recycled materials that meet the stringent requirements of renewable energy storage applications.

Hydrometallurgical recycling processes have proven particularly effective for energy storage applications, achieving recovery rates exceeding 95% for critical materials. These processes produce battery-grade lithium carbonate, refined nickel and cobalt compounds, and high-quality graphite suitable for new battery manufacturing, directly supporting the renewable energy storage supply chain.

Environmental Benefits of Recycled Materials in Energy Storage

The environmental advantages of using recycled materials in renewable energy storage systems are substantial and well-documented. EPA research on lithium-ion battery recycling indicates that recycled battery materials can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to virgin material production, significantly improving the overall environmental profile of energy storage systems.

Recycling processes minimize the environmental impact associated with critical mineral extraction, reducing habitat destruction, water consumption, and chemical pollution typically associated with mining operations. The NREL manufacturing analysis confirms that incorporating recycled materials into energy storage systems substantially reduces their lifecycle carbon footprint while maintaining performance standards.

Water usage represents another critical environmental consideration, as traditional mining operations consume vast quantities of water resources. Recycling processes require significantly less water while producing materials of comparable or superior quality for energy storage applications. This reduction in water consumption becomes particularly important as renewable energy deployment scales to meet global climate goals.

Supply Chain Resilience Through Recycling

The development of domestic recycling capabilities enhances supply chain resilience for renewable energy storage systems by reducing dependence on volatile international markets for critical minerals. Sustainable battery supply chain strategies increasingly emphasize local material recovery to ensure consistent access to essential materials.

Recycling operations provide a reliable source of critical materials that can be scaled to meet growing demand from renewable energy storage deployments. The NREL LIBRA technical analysis projects that recycling could supply significant portions of future material demand for energy storage systems, reducing price volatility and supply disruption risks.

Strategic material recovery through recycling creates buffer stocks of essential minerals within domestic supply chains, providing security against geopolitical disruptions and export restrictions. This supply chain diversification proves particularly valuable for renewable energy storage deployments that require consistent material availability for sustained operation and maintenance.

Economic Advantages of Recycling for Renewable Energy Storage

The economic benefits of using recycled materials in renewable energy storage systems extend beyond simple cost savings to encompass broader value creation opportunities. Recycling operations generate new revenue streams while reducing disposal costs, creating positive economic impacts throughout the energy storage value chain.

Manufacturing costs for energy storage systems decrease when incorporating recycled materials, as recycling processes often produce materials at lower costs than equivalent virgin materials. These cost reductions enable more competitive pricing for renewable energy storage installations, accelerating deployment and improving project economics for renewable energy developers.

The domestic recycling industry creates high-value employment opportunities in advanced manufacturing and materials processing, supporting economic development in regions transitioning toward clean energy economies. Local recycling operations generate economic multiplier effects through supply chain integration and technology development activities.

Closed-Loop Systems for Renewable Energy Applications

Closed-loop lithium recovery systems represent the ultimate in sustainable material management for renewable energy storage, creating self-sustaining cycles where materials flow continuously from used batteries back into new energy storage systems without waste generation.

These closed-loop approaches optimize material utilization efficiency while minimizing environmental impact, aligning perfectly with the sustainability goals driving renewable energy adoption. Advanced recycling technologies enable the preservation of material quality through multiple use cycles, maintaining performance standards essential for reliable energy storage operation.

The implementation of closed-loop systems for renewable energy storage creates long-term material security while supporting circular economy principles. These systems reduce the overall material intensity of renewable energy deployments, making large-scale renewable energy storage more sustainable and economically viable.

Integration with Grid-Scale Storage Systems

Grid-scale renewable energy storage systems benefit significantly from the reliable material supply chains enabled by advanced recycling technologies. These large installations require substantial quantities of battery materials with consistent quality specifications, making recycled materials an attractive option for utility-scale deployments.

The modular nature of modern recycling operations allows for scalable material production that can grow alongside renewable energy storage deployment. This scalability ensures that material supply can match the rapid expansion of renewable energy storage capacity without creating supply bottlenecks or price pressures.

Technical specifications for grid-scale storage systems align well with the capabilities of advanced recycling technologies, which produce materials meeting or exceeding the performance requirements for utility-scale applications. The proven reliability of recycled materials in demanding applications provides confidence for grid operators investing in renewable energy storage infrastructure.

Future Trends in Sustainable Energy Storage

The convergence of advanced recycling technologies with renewable energy storage represents a fundamental shift toward truly sustainable energy systems. EV battery supply chain sustainability innovations demonstrate how integrated recycling approaches can transform entire sectors while supporting renewable energy goals.

Emerging recycling technologies continue to improve recovery rates and material quality while reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. These advances position recycled materials as preferred options for renewable energy storage applications, creating competitive advantages for sustainable energy storage solutions.

Regulatory frameworks increasingly support the integration of recycled materials into renewable energy infrastructure through incentives and requirements that favor sustainable material sourcing. The EPA Extended Producer Responsibility framework exemplifies these policy trends that will drive greater adoption of recycled materials in energy storage applications.

Technology Integration and Performance Optimization

The successful integration of recycled materials into renewable energy storage systems requires sophisticated technology platforms that can accommodate variable material inputs while maintaining consistent performance outputs. Advanced battery management systems optimize the utilization of recycled materials to ensure reliable operation under diverse grid conditions.

Quality control processes for recycled materials have evolved to meet the demanding specifications required for renewable energy storage applications. These processes ensure that recycled materials maintain the purity levels and performance characteristics essential for long-term storage system reliability and efficiency.

Performance monitoring systems track the behavior of recycled materials in operational renewable energy storage installations, providing valuable feedback for continuous improvement of recycling processes and material specifications. This data-driven approach enables ongoing optimization of recycled material integration in energy storage systems.

Global Impact and Scalability

The global impact of integrating recycled materials into renewable energy storage systems extends far beyond individual installations to encompass systemic changes in how clean energy infrastructure is developed and maintained. International cooperation in recycling standards and technology sharing accelerates the adoption of sustainable practices across global energy storage markets.

Scalability considerations for recycled material production align with the exponential growth projected for renewable energy storage deployments worldwide. The modular and distributed nature of modern recycling technologies enables proportional scaling to meet growing material demand without creating infrastructure bottlenecks.

The circular economy perspective on battery recycling demonstrates how sustainable material cycles can support unlimited renewable energy growth while minimizing environmental impact. This approach creates a foundation for long-term renewable energy expansion that remains environmentally and economically sustainable.

Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Energy Future

Renewable energy storage solutions through battery recycling represent a critical convergence of clean energy technology and sustainable material management. The integration of recycled materials into energy storage systems creates multiple benefits including reduced environmental impact, enhanced supply chain resilience, and improved economic viability for renewable energy deployments.

Advanced recycling technologies have matured to the point where recycled materials can fully meet the performance requirements of demanding renewable energy storage applications while providing significant advantages over virgin materials. The continued development of these technologies ensures that recycled materials will play an increasingly important role in supporting global renewable energy expansion.

The successful implementation of recycling-based renewable energy storage solutions requires continued innovation, supportive policy frameworks, and industry collaboration to realize the full potential of sustainable energy storage systems. These integrated approaches provide a pathway toward achieving renewable energy goals while maintaining environmental stewardship and economic sustainability.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/656f4b27b9760a4c6f6b2bd1/69135e1697a1dc61dfb19811_image-gen%20(20).png,N,,2025-11-25 19:02:12.161435

“In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said.

“Since 2021, the United States has experienced an unprecedented clean energy manufacturing boom, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to communities across the country,” according to the report.","It’s been doom and gloom galore for the EV sector of late.

Amid slower demand and federal policy changes deprioritizing electrification, the industry is shedding jobs and delaying or canceling projects. In fact, 2025 has seen more clean energy manufacturing investments canceled than announced—a stark change from just a few years ago, when the US was on the cusp of an EV and battery manufacturing boom.

But some industry analysts say that despite some very real pain in the short term, the future remains bright for zero-emissions vehicles. In the meantime, buckle up for a bumpy ride.

Loren McDonald, CEO and chief analyst at Chargeonomics, compared today’s EV market to the early days of cellular technology.

“What history has told us now is we were actually in the BlackBerry phase, and still are. The product is good, but it’s not compelling enough for average consumers,” he said. “We haven’t actually reached the phase with the product that’s more like the iPhone, where everybody goes, ‘Oh my God, I need to have an EV, it’s so much better than my gas car.’”

Pump the brakes

In October, General Motors said it planned to indefinitely lay off 1,750 workers and temporarily lay off another 1,670 as it trims EV and battery production at plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. Part of the plan includes temporarily idling GM’s Factory Zero plant in Detroit, which produces multiple EVs, and then resuming production with only one shift, according to InsideEVs. The production pause at two EV battery plants is slated to last until mid-2026.

“In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said. “Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our US manufacturing footprint.”

EV maker Rivian also recently announced 600 job cuts, with CEO RJ Scaringe reportedly telling employees: “With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”

And as The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, Ford is considering cutting its electric F-150 Lightning amid weak sales and mounting losses in its EV business. The WSJ also noted Stellantis’s canceled plans for an electric version of its full-size Ram pickup truck earlier this year and sluggish sales of Tesla’s Cybertruck.

Freudenberg e-Power Systems recently announced the closure of two EV battery plants in Michigan, resulting in 324 layoffs, The Hill reported; company leaders cited “the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America.”

Rest of World published an analysis in September reporting that more than 30,000 workers had lost their jobs at EV manufacturers “and related industries worldwide over the past year” amid trade policy changes, weaker growth, geopolitical tensions, higher interest rates, and a more competitive market.

Research firm Atlas Public Policy, in partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund, recently tallied total cancellations representing nearly $21 billion in investments in clean energy manufacturing in the first three quarters of 2025. Battery projects have taken the biggest hit: 11% of announced projects were scrapped, mostly this year.

One bright spot: The authors noted that about four-fifths of active investments were under construction or operational, and Q3 had net positive investments. Since 2000, the clean energy manufacturing sector has drawn nearly $250 billion in investments, most announced since mid-2021, during Joe Biden’s presidency.

“Since 2021, the United States has experienced an unprecedented clean energy manufacturing boom, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to communities across the country,” according to the report. “However, the first nine months of 2025 have seen a stark change. Trump administration policies and cuts to clean energy tax credits have slowed growth considerably and threatened progress.”

The pullback comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill, which set Sept. 30 as the expiration date for federal tax credits on certain EV purchases. Atlas analysts pointed to “funding cuts and policy shifts” as the driving forces behind “cancellations of $20.8 billion and nearly 27,300 anticipated manufacturing jobs in 2025 alone.”

“When we think about the cancellations, it’s numbers for sure, but also this has a negative impact on communities that were anticipating preparing for economic opportunities from these clean energy projects, whether it was through the anticipated jobs themselves, maybe workforce development programs that the company and the community had agreed to establish,” Matthew Vining, a policy analyst at Atlas, told us.

Idling

If this all sounds bleak for the prospect of carbon-free transportation, some industry analysts view it as a short-term correction. What’s really happening, McDonald contended, is more complicated than just the fallout of tax credits going away. He sees the recent pullback as a result of how legacy automakers approached the launch of their first-generation EVs.

“[The end of the tax credits is] a real thing, but the automakers are using it as an excuse to pull back,” he said. “It allows them to take a deep breath and go, ‘Phew, now we can focus on selling those $80,000 fully loaded gas Chevy Tahoes and things like that,’ while they actually work on building their generation two, generation three EV models that are truly compelling.”

In some cases, legacy automakers converted existing internal combustion engine vehicles to electric rather than developing new platforms from the ground up. Many are now working on next-gen EVs built on new platforms. Ford, for example, is introducing an entirely new manufacturing process to support production of a smaller, more affordable electric truck.

GM, meantime, is preparing to relaunch the mass market-oriented Chevy Bolt, and Rivian is slated to debut its more-affordable R2 lineup next year, among other upcoming launches.

As McDonald sees it, the US’s first EV phase was defined by products that didn’t match what mainstream consumers were looking for. Automakers found some success, to be sure—Rivian’s R1S in the luxury segment, for example. And half of the Cadillac brand’s sales are now electric.

But the next EV era, McDonald said, must feature mass-market EVs with lower price tags and better software experiences.

“If you get the car right, and it’s a fit with the market, and you price it correctly, there’s solid demand and market for it,” McDonald said. “We just don’t have enough of those vehicles yet. And that’s the problem—not EVs.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-25 17:01:35.591886

Efforts to ease their path from Long Island Sound — including the installation of a fish ladder alongside the dam in the 1990s — have largely failed, officials say, and Kinneytown Dam remains a major migratory roadblock on the Naugatuck’s watershed.
The project is the largest active dam removal effort currently underway in Connecticut, which has one of the largest concentrations of dams in the United States.
A spokesperson for the federal agency said Monday that it has yet to receive a removal application related to the Kinneytown Dam.
A decade ago, DEEP completed work on a $6.3 million fish bypass on the Tingue Dam less than 2 miles upstream from Kinneytown.","For well over a century, fish making spawning runs up the Naugatuck River have had their journey cut short just 16 miles inland at the Kinneytown Dam in Ansonia.

Above the dam, the river flows relatively unencumbered from Thomaston 30 miles to the north, where it draws from dozens of tributaries that serve as vital habitats for spawning shad, lampreys, eels and Atlantic salmon.

Efforts to ease their path from Long Island Sound — including the installation of a fish ladder alongside the dam in the 1990s — have largely failed, officials say, and Kinneytown Dam remains a major migratory roadblock on the Naugatuck’s watershed.

“Without the removal of this dam, it can never be a river,” said Kevin Zak, a local advocate who has led efforts for years to restore the Naugatuck River, which he says behaves more like a “landlocked lake.”

“It looks like a river, and you would think that it acts like a river, but it doesn’t,” Zak said. “You can’t put a price tag on a free-flowing river, the economic and quality of life benefits are just astounding. You don’t have to build it, it’s already there.”

Earlier this month, the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank announced that it had closed a deal to purchase the dam and surrounding property from a private company in Washington state for $1, a critical step forward in what officials expect will be a $60 million effort to remove the dam and restore the river to its natural course.

The project is the largest active dam removal effort currently underway in Connecticut, which has one of the largest concentrations of dams in the United States.

Many of the dams being removed date back to Connecticut’s industrial past, when rivers powered mills across the state.

“We have more than 4,000 dams in the state, and they’re being removed on a regular basis because they’re no longer functional,” said Alicea Charamut, executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut. “They’re deteriorating, and it’s important that they are removed before they cause too much damage.”

James Fowler, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said that removing the Kinneytown Dam will “provide significant ecological, recreational, and community benefits, including for nearby environmental justice communities.” The agency has contributed $1.6 million toward the removal effort.

The dam, which was built in 1840s, continued to operate as a hydroelectric facility until 2020 when its generators were turned off by its former owners, Enel North America.

Enel sold the dam later that year to a firm called HydroLand Inc., which stated its intent to repair and modernize the dam in order to continue producing electricity. But that plan never came to fruition, leaving the dam to languish while local officials began exploring ways to purchase the dam to tear it down. (In the meantime, Hydroland transferred ownership of the dam to a related entity based out of Washington state, Trimaran Energy.)

“That went from a long period of time of these guys still trying to squeeze some dollars out of us in this acquisition to acquiring it for dollar,” said Rick Dunne, the president of the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank.

Timothy Carlsen, who is listed in official documents as a point-of-contact for both HydroLand and Trimaran, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.

The Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank is based in Waterbury and has worked on over a dozen environmental assessment and remediation projects throughout the state. Dunne, its leader, is also executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments.

Concerns with the dam aren’t limited to the obstruction of migratory fish. Advocates and local officials have also worried that the dam’s deteriorating condition could result in a failure that would send millions of gallons of water rushing downstream.

When the region was hit with devastating floods in 2023, the torrent of water flowing over the dam washed away much of an earthen berm carrying Metro-North’s Waterbury branch line, resulting in millions of dollars of damage.

The berm also separates the river from a canal that flows into an artificial pond containing contaminated sediments leftover from the days when Ansonia was a center of brass manufacturing. Flooding could spread that contamination.

“It was only a matter of a few more inches of rain, or another hour or two of heavy rain, it could have completely breached,” Dunne said. “So we’re really worried about catastrophic release at this point because we found out things about the integrity of this dam since we’ve been in there that are really scary.”

Zak, the advocate who now serves as president of Naugatuck River Revival, said the dam has also suffered from a series of longstanding flaws related to the design of the fish ladder that was built in 1999 at the behest of the the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in order to allow the dam to continue operating as a hydroelectric facility.

Videos filmed by Zak and posted online show fish struggling to make their way up river past the dam, while whole sections of the ladder are filled with debris.

“It was a terrible design,” Zak said. “Fish ladders, if they’re short and straight, are moderately okay. This is neither. This is extremely long… and it has a zigzag entrance, so the fish have to find it and navigate to it. Then they have to go up, down, back. It’s stupid.”

A 2010 fire in one of the dam’s two generation units caused further damage to the passageway, according to a complaint submitted to FERC in 2021 by the NVCOG and Naugatuck River Revival. By 2020, a report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the numbers of some fish species using the ladder — including alewife, shad and brown trout — had fallen by over 90%.

Enel North America, the company that owned the dam at the time the fish ladder was installed, did not respond to a request for comment last week.

Dunne said that more than $50 million has already been committed to the project from state and federal sources. More than half of that, $25 million, is state bonding approved by lawmakers earlier this year that’s awaiting final approval from the State Bond Commission.

The project has also been awarded a $15 million grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association as well as $4 million in federal Clean Water Act funding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is also spending $1.5 million to test the sediment behind the dam for contaminants.

As part of the effort to remove the dam, Dunne said the land bank also plans to ask officials in Ansonia and Seymour to waive any taxes that went unpaid by the dam’s previous owners.

So far, Dunne said none of the money for the dam removal has been affeccted by President Donald Trump’s budget cutbacks. (Earlier this year, NVCOG had a $5.7 million federal grant to complete portions of the Naugatuck River Greenway Trail rescinded by the Trump administration.)

The land bank must also receive formal approval from FERC, which regulates hydroelectric projects, to remove the dam. A spokesperson for the federal agency said Monday that it has yet to receive a removal application related to the Kinneytown Dam.

Absent any delays in the delivery of federal funding or regulatory approvals, Dunne said he expects crews to begin work next year on relocating a series of sewer mains that will be affected by the project.

From there, Dunne said removal of the dam structure could take place as soon as 2027, with final work on the project wrapping up the following year.

“Demolishing the dam is a relatively simple, straightforward and short process,” Dunne said. “It’s dealing with the sediments, dealing with the flows and dealing with the reconstruction, the rehabilitation and restoration of all the river features… that’s where the work is.”

If successful, the demolition of the Kinneytown Dam would follow similar dam removal projects along Connecticut’s Scantic and Farmington Rivers, as well as a string of other projects along the Naugatuck River.

A decade ago, DEEP completed work on a $6.3 million fish bypass on the Tingue Dam less than 2 miles upstream from Kinneytown.

The bypass, which is surrounded by a park, is wider than a traditional fish ladder and features a more gradual incline to mimic the natural flow of the river. But despite praise for its design, advocates like Zak say it is of little use to fish if they never make it past Kinneytown.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80243/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1121_sr_kinneytowndam_017-771x5141764107030.jpg?h=65a9384d&itok=8ITsyUyr,N,,2025-11-25 17:03:57.382264

The lawsuit, filed in the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish, claims laws passed since 2020 violate the state constitution by allowing companies engaged in carbon capture and storage to use eminent domain for private gain.

The plaintiffs include the nonprofit group Save My Louisiana, composed of several property owners in Rapides, Vernon, Allen and Beauregard parishes. They want the laws declared unconstitutional and state officials ordered to halt all permitting and regulatory actions related to Class VI injection wells and pipelines across the state.

The lawsuit names the state of Louisiana as the defendant through Gov. Jeff Landry and Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Justin Davidson. The plaintiffs argue Louisiana’s carbon capture and sequestration laws violate private property rights, allow improper use of eminent domain for private gain and fail to protect public health and safety.

Landry’s office and the Department of Conservation and Energy declined requests for comment on the lawsuit. The Center Square’s attempts to reach Save My Louisiana were unsuccessful before publication.

Louisiana is considered an attractive location for carbon storage wells due to its subsurface geology, which features deep saline aquifers and porous rock reservoirs, and because it is located in the center of manufacturing and energy hubs in the Southeast.

The state was granted primacy over Class VI carbon capture wells by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December 2023, giving it direct authority to permit and regulate the storage of carbon dioxide.

Around 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects are seeking state approval, mostly in central and southwest Louisiana, according to a map from the Department of Conservation and Energy.

In mid-October, after police juries in Vernon, Allen and other parishes in west central Louisiana opposed the projects, Landry issued an executive order directing the state’s Department of Energy and Conservation to suspend review of new applications to construct Class VI wells.

SUBJECT: RFI Response – Accelerating Speed to Power

FROM: Bipartisan Policy Center, Energy Team

The Bipartisan Policy Center appreciates the opportunity to respond to this RFI on Accelerating Speed to Power. Through our Artificial Intelligence and Energy Project, BPC is exploring bipartisan policy opportunities at the intersection of AI, energy, and infrastructure. We are committed to forward-looking solutions that meet America’s growing electricity demand for reliable, affordable, and clean energy, while accelerating AI infrastructure development and optimizing AI’s use in the United States energy sector.

In April 2025, BPC launched an AI and Energy Task Force composed of tech leaders, power producers, utilities, scholars, nongovernmental organizations, and industry experts. The focus areas of the task force include electricity demand and grid reliability, AI innovation, and AI applications in energy. From ensuring grid stability to optimizing clean energy development, AI can be a powerful tool if the right policies are in place. BPC and the task force are researching and developing policy solutions that foster a competitive edge in AI while ensuring an abundant energy supply for generations to come.

This RFI response is informed by recent BPC publications related to AI and Energy, including BPC’s September 2024 publication, Accelerating AI Sustainability and Innovation at the Department of Energy and February 2025 publication, Electricity Demand Growth and Data Centers: A Guide for the Perplexed.

I. Use of DOE Funding, Financing, and Technical Assistance

BPC recommends the following for DOE to support development and deployment of large-scale generation and transmission projects.

Collaborating with industry to develop energy-efficient AI systems

Investing in AI applications to accelerate energy and fuel technology development

Enhancing the reliability of electricity grid and energy assets with AI tools

Delivering reliable, affordable, clean power to meet data center electricity needs

Centralizing DOE’s AI strategy and execution

Collaborating with industry to develop energy-efficient AI systems. The Department of Energy should focus R&D investments in energy-efficient AI systems to complement private sector investments. In recent years, industry partners have invested resources into developing chip efficiency and networking components for data transfer. Historically, this work was supported by DOE and has now reached a critical juncture where the private sector is equipped and motivated to pursue additional efficiency advancements on its own.

DOE was highly successful in advancing energy efficiency of supercomputing chips by setting aggressive efficiency targets for industry to meet in its Exascale Computing Program. Moving forward, continued collaboration with industry will be important to ensure federal resources are directed to areas lacking private-sector expertise or interest. This may include hardware-software integration, optimizing AI algorithms for scientific applications, and investing in R&D for energy-efficient data centers. DOE should deepen collaborations with companies to develop energy-efficient and custom AI systems for scientific research and other application areas relevant to DOE’s mission. These partnerships should focus on AI-specific workloads, such as scientific modeling, that differ from commercial AI systems.

DOE should also invest in R&D to advance data center energy efficiency. This could include advanced cooling technologies and applications of waste heat. This should be a cross-cutting effort that builds off DOE’s existing knowledge in this field at the Office of Science, Building Technologies Office, and Federal Energy Management Program.

Investing in AI applications to accelerate energy and fuel technology development. AI has the potential to accelerate every step of the energy and fuel technology development process from R&D to manufacturing, scaleup, commercialization, adoption, and operations. DOE is well-positioned to lead the nation in developing AI R&D for these applications. DOE should build off its existing expertise to help lay the groundwork for private sector adoption of AI-based applications that enhance the energy system. This should start with close collaboration between the DOE Office of Science and applied energy offices to develop research portfolios that meaningfully incorporate AI as a tool for accelerating energy and fuel technology invention, scaleup, and deployment.

Enhancing the reliability of electricity grid and energy assets with AI tools. Beyond technology development, DOE should invest in R&D to build AI applications that improve the operations, maintenance, and management of the electricity grid and other energy assets including nuclear power plants. This could include using AI to improve forecasting of flexible generation based on weather patterns to aid in matching energy generation and load, develop more accurate models of climate impacts to enable resilient infrastructure investments, and support predictive maintenance of grid infrastructure and energy assets.

DOE should partner closely with utilities, regional transmission organizations, and other relevant private sector stakeholders in this effort to advance AI-enabled solutions that solve barriers to deployment of smart grid technologies. DOE can make investments through R&D to advance technological feasibility of AI grid applications and test beds to pilot and prove technologies in environments that mimic real-world scenarios. This could build off existing grid test beds at the DOE national labs.

Delivering reliable, affordable, clean power to meet data center electricity needs. With the increasing electricity demand from AI and data centers, DOE should support the development of power projects by supporting partnerships between project developers and AI and data center companies seeking reliable energy. DOE could help facilitate the timely development of the power projects, transmission facilities, and cost allocation frameworks that are necessary to ensuring ample supplies of power for AI and data centers. DOE support could also include assistance from the Energy Dominance Financing Program, which could supply project developers with needed capital while also providing a long-term customer that derisks demand-side challenges for nascent energy technologies that have not yet been widely deployed. This is a crucial opportunity to leverage AI and data center electricity demand to finance clean energy demonstration projects—such as advanced geothermal and advanced nuclear—to scale these nascent technologies to commercial viability.

Centralizing DOE’s AI strategy and execution. DOE should establish a single coordinating office at DOE to align research priorities and resource allocation across the department’s science and applied energy offices and 17 national labs.

II. Load Growth Trends

In February 2025, BPC published Electricity Demand Growth and Data Centers: A Guide for the Perplexed, which examines the accuracy of data center electricity demand projections and their implications for policymakers. This report noted that data centers will likely account for up to 25% of expected electricity load growth nationally through 2030, with the remaining 75% being driven by onshoring of manufacturing and increasing electrification of transportation, heating, and industrial processes. It is important to address future uncertainties from advancements or changes in computing efficiency, manufacturing capacity, and demand for AI products and services. BPC has identified the following primary drivers of new electric load:

Data centers and AI computing facilities driving multi-gigawatt demand growth

Advanced manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication plants as complementary large loads

Two major factors are expected to determine the impact of new computing applications on electricity demand in coming years:

Service Demand, as determined by the quantity of computations being performed

Computing efficiency, at determined by the amount of energy required to perform each computation.

There is evidence that data center buildout is entering a new and more contentious phase with siting issues and growing public concern. Thus, expectations that growth will continue in the next decade as rapidly as it has in the recent past are uncertain.

BPC supports efforts to improve load growth forecasting methodology through better data collection methodology, tightening criteria around how to “count” projects in the pipeline, and assigning probabilities to projects at different stages of development.

III. Grid Infrastructure Constraints

BPC has identified the following energy system constraints which are limiting the ability to serve future demand:

Long interconnection queues

Challenges with the existing permitting process

Supply chain challenges

Slow uptake of existing Grid Enhancing Technologies

Long interconnection queues. The process to connect new electricity generation to the electric grid varies significantly by state and region, ranging from 2-5 years. Aligning data center construction timelines with access to power is a challenge, prompting data center developers to favor sites with shorter interconnection queues. Some jurisdictions are considering accelerating interconnection for power to serve data centers if the operators agree to serve as flexible loads. This could increase grid reliability in regions where these projects are being considered.

Challenges with the existing Permitting process. The current permitting process for energy projects is too slow and expensive to meet our energy reliability and affordability needs. BPC’s report, Finding the Goldilocks Zone for Permitting Reform, provides a list of 70 policy ideas, ranked by level of effectiveness and controversy, that could be considered to address delays and challenges associated with permitting. Overall, BPC believes that permit reform options should simultaneously increase the efficiency of the permitting process, protect the environment, and ensure public safeguards. BPC sees strong potential for AI to support streamlining of the permitting process.

Supply chain challenges. Components required for electricity generation technologies and grid equipment are experiencing supply chain challenges. This includes delays for transformers, other grid equipment, and natural gas turbines. While these delays are not specific to powering data centers, such projects are being affected. Due to these supply chain challenges, some data center operators are seeking to procure their own generation through co-location agreements or repowering decommissioned generation facilities, including nuclear plants.

Slow uptake of existing Grid Enhancing Technologies. GETs maximize the transmission of electricity across the existing system through a family of technologies that include sensors, power flow control devices, and analytical tools. Adoption of these technologies has been inefficient due to a misalignment of incentives and lack of comfort with the application of GETs technologies on existing systems.

Sincerely,

Kathryn Kline Tyndall

And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.
Earthjustice, its clients, and partners intervened last year to defend the soot standard against court challenges from polluters and their allies.
“EPA’s soot standards are life-saving protections that are firmly grounded in bedrock Clean Air Act legal authority.
We will continue to vigorously defend these vital safeguards.” – Peter Zalzal, distinguished counsel and associate vice president for Clean Air Strategies, Environmental Defense Fund.","Washington, D.C. —Last night, in an unprecedented move, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave up defending the national, health-based limits on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), also known as soot, that EPA strengthened last year. The EPA’s court filing asks the U.S, Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to strike down the soot standard.

Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, results in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources like vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 — or the soot standards — are a cornerstone of the Clean Air Act. After over a decade without updates, the EPA followed the advice of independent experts and extensive scientific evidence and strengthened the annual soot standard to better protect public health, reducing the allowable level from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. Corporations and dozens of state attorneys general sued shortly after, though the rule is projected to result in billions of dollars in health benefits, prevent thousands of premature deaths, and deliver cleaner air to millions of people, particularly those living near highways, factories, and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of Healthy Communities at Earthjustice. “Trump has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money, and this administration’s EPA has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives, or serving children, families, or communities. We will continue to defend this life-saving standard.”

“The public health and economic benefits of the current standard are tangible,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at Clean Air Task Force. “By EPA’s own estimate, the current PM NAAQS would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits, and 4,500 premature deaths — adding up to $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act.”

The EPA has never before abandoned its legal defense of a strengthened national ambient air quality standard. The agency and Department of Justice had previously vigorously defended the standard as recently as December 2024. Despite EPA’s filing endorsing some of the challengers’ legal arguments, the science remains clear that the prior standard allowed significant human health harms to occur, including numerous deaths, and needed to be strengthened to protect public health. The standard also remains in effect and is firmly within EPA’s legal scope, supported by the EPA’s own scientific evidence.

The EPA found that meeting the stronger standard would provide benefits for public health valued at $46 billion each year once all areas come into compliance, while costing less than 1.5% of that amount. There are many commonsense and low-cost solutions to reduce pollution from large industrial sources. Earthjustice analyzed polluters’ faulty claims about predicted impacts of the new standard and found that they were based on flawed analysis. Cleaner air and economic growth have gone hand in hand after past air standard improvements. And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.

Air pollution is a serious problem, especially for children, and Black communities and other people of color breathe in more of it, and face higher rates of asthma, heart disease, and premature death. Studies show that Black communities are exposed to roughly 1.5 times more deadly soot pollution than white communities.

In April, a coalition of 100 environmental, public health, and community groups urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to uphold and swiftly implement the 2024 soot standard, warning that any delay would endanger already overburdened communities.

Earthjustice, its clients, and partners intervened last year to defend the soot standard against court challenges from polluters and their allies. Earthjustice clients are Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Lung Association, Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition, Rio Grande International Study Center, and Sierra Club. Clean Air Task Force represents Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future and Conservation Law Foundation.

Quotes from our clients

“Instead of enforcing clean air protections, EPA is cynically partnering with big polluters to bypass public input and dismantle the laws that safeguard the air we all breathe. It ignores the clear science telling us that this choice will be deadly,” said John Walke, senior attorney and director of federal clean air at NRDC.

“Our communities already carry the burden of polluted air and higher rates of asthma and heart disease. Weakening soot protections will only deepen these disparities and cost more Black lives,” said Yvonka Hall, executive director of the Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition.

“In the border region, families breathe air laced with pollution from trucks, refineries, and factories. This decision puts our health and our children’s future at even greater risk,” said Tricia Cortez, executive director of the Rio Grande International Study Center.

“As nurses, we see the toll air pollution takes on our patients — especially kids and older adults. Gutting science-based standards puts lives in danger and public health on the line,” said Katie Huffling, DNP, RN, CNM, FAAN executive director from the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

“EPA’s soot standards are life-saving protections that are firmly grounded in bedrock Clean Air Act legal authority. The Trump administration’s attempt to reverse course and weaken the soot standards would mean more pollution, more serious health problems, and more deaths. We will continue to vigorously defend these vital safeguards.” – Peter Zalzal, distinguished counsel and associate vice president for Clean Air Strategies, Environmental Defense Fund.

“Lee Zeldin’s continued attacks on clean air are reckless, life-threatening, and a complete betrayal of the EPA’s core mission to protect our communities and our environment,” said Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp. “While this administration continues to strip away access to affordable health care, they are simultaneously allowing fossil fuel companies to cut corners and make Americans sicker. We will continue to fight back against Lee Zeldin’s dangerous agenda to bolster fossil fuels and protect Americans from toxic pollutants.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-25 17:03:12.800937

According to the test conducted Sept. 4, Atalco’s sampled discharges were significantly more toxic than what the state allows in the Mississippi River.
“The stuff that’s in the effluent is probably far more toxic than they realize.” LDEQ puts Atalco refinery on notice for ‘red mud’ leaks.
It’s unclear how often facilities such as Atalco fail effluent toxicity tests.
Harhara said toxicity test failures are infrequent at facilities with properly working treatment systems.","A refinery near Gramercy faces new allegations from state regulators after water samples taken from the facility’s Mississippi River outfall proved deadly to aquatic animals during a routine lab test.

On Oct. 24, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued a new “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order to the Atlantic Alumina Co. facility that refines bauxite mineral into a feedstock chemical used to make aluminum. The facility is the only one of its kind in the United States.

The notice serves to warn the company of potential penalties for alleged violations state inspectors documented during a recent file review and field visits conducted Aug. 8 and Oct. 17 following a citizen’s complaint. The document, which the Department of Environmental Quality published earlier this month, notes the Atalco refinery failed an effluent toxicity test of the discharges sampled from its Mississippi River drainage outlet. Performed every three months as a matter of routine, the toxicity test involves exposing minnows and crustaceans to various concentrations of the sampled effluent over a 48-hour period.

According to the test conducted Sept. 4, Atalco’s sampled discharges were significantly more toxic than what the state allows in the Mississippi River. Even at the lowest concentration tested, the sampled effluent began killing significant numbers of crustaceans. When tested at the 1.5% standard concentration at which the animals should still be able to survive, the effluent killed 64% of the Daphnia pulex crustaceans, better known as water fleas.

Atalco did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Ahmed Harhara is a chemical engineer who runs a neighborhood-level environmental data website in the Houston area and is familiar with the toxicity tests used in refinery operations. He reviewed the Atalco lab results and said they are a strong signal of a serious problem at the facility.

“These tests are basically an early warning system,” Harhara said. “If fish or small aquatic animals don’t survive in the sample water, it means the effluent is too toxic — even after it’s been treated — and could harm life in nearby streams if released.”

Harhara pointed out that the method for toxicity testing is tailored to the specific water stream receiving the discharges. The test conducted for Atalco uses a dilution or concentration factor that takes into account the Mississippi River’s current and massive volume of water, meaning it would take high levels of toxicity to fail the test.

Nicholas Fisher, an environmental scientist who studies aquatic pollution at Stony Brook University and also reviewed the lab results, said effluent toxicity tests often understate the danger of the pollution.

“I would say they’re overlooking a lot of the toxicity,” Fisher said. “The stuff that’s in the effluent is probably far more toxic than they realize.”

LDEQ puts Atalco refinery on notice for ‘red mud’ leaks. Fines to be determined.

When tested on minnows, the sampled effluent had no significant effect, but both Harhara and Fisher said that’s not surprising as the crustaceans are generally far more sensitive to many industrial contaminants. Also, fish are more mobile than small crustaceans and can swim away from areas of poor water quality, Harhara said.

It’s unclear how often facilities such as Atalco fail effluent toxicity tests. LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said only it happens occasionally, but had no relevant data available. The agency doesn’t track the test results in a global way, she added.

Harhara said toxicity test failures are infrequent at facilities with properly working treatment systems.

“In my view, it is newsworthy precisely because these failures are rare and measurable. They show where the treatment system may have slipped, even briefly,” he said. “It’s the kind of data point regulators and the public should pay attention to.”

On Oct. 21, just days before the Department of Environmental Quality issued the notice of potential penalty, aerial photos of the Atalco site showed plumes of discoloration in the river coming from the facility’s drainage pipe.

Aside from the toxicity test results, LDEQ’s notice cited large volumes of discharges with high pH levels that Atalco drained into the river at over 20 times the rate allowed under its permit.

When state inspectors visited the area on Aug. 8 and Oct. 17, they discovered public stormwater ditches and waterways filled with reddish-orange water. This included the Hope Canal, which flows to the Maurepas Swamp, according to the notice.

An Atalco representative told the inspectors the facility’s runoff containment system failed after it was inundated with sediment, and the runoff became contaminated with Atalco’s “red mud” waste, the notice states.

“The inspection revealed that the Respondent failed to maintain waters of the state in an aesthetically attractive condition and meet the generally accepted aesthetic qualifications,” the LDEQ notice said.

Atalco received a similar notice from the Department of Environmental Quality in August for separate violations stemming from erosion channels in the giant levees of Atalco’s red mud waste lakes. The fissures allowed waste slurry to escape from the facility and contaminate state waters.

Records the Illuminator reviewed indicate the facility’s waste byproduct contains toxic heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals.

The latest infractions continue a pattern spanning more than a year during which the company has struggled to contain toxic releases from its facility despite heightened public scrutiny over previous violations of environmental laws and workplace safety regulations.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8788-scaled-e1762215226969-2048x1232.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:02:58.817346

Trump’s Pesticide Stance Sparks Backlash After Earlier Promise of Crackdown

During his campaign, Donald Trump vowed to protect Americans from toxic chemicals—especially pesticides—promising a major investigation led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and pledging to phase out harmful agricultural chemicals banned abroad. Yet critics say the administration is now moving in the opposite direction.

Despite public commitments to reduce exposure to dangerous chemicals, the EPA under Trump has pushed to approve several new pesticides, including products containing PFAS—chemicals twice blocked by federal courts over health risks. The agency insists its review process is rigorous, science-driven, and designed to protect people and the environment, emphasizing that pesticides remain essential for farming, pest control, and public health.

Some experts say the EPA’s pace is typical and that PFAS-based pesticides aren’t new. They argue that certain PFAS, like TFA, pose different risks than long-chain PFAS such as PFOS or PFOA, and that modern agriculture can’t rely solely on organic methods.

But environmental and farmworker advocates argue the administration is abandoning its promises. They warn that approving more powerful pesticides deepens farmer dependence on toxic chemicals, increases risks for farmworkers and nearby communities, and contributes to long-term health issues—including cancer, Parkinson’s disease, fertility problems, and developmental disorders in children. They also express concern that the EPA is “fast-tracking” approvals without adequate review.

PFAS pesticides are especially controversial due to their persistence in the environment, ability to contaminate drinking water, and links to cancer, immune disruption, and hormonal effects. While some scientists note that newer PFAS pesticides break down faster in the body, others say their hazards are too well documented to justify expanded use.

Overall, critics argue that instead of building a safer, more resilient food system, the administration’s actions risk locking farmers and communities into a cycle of escalating chemical dependence and worsening health outcomes.

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit.

John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the CCP, recently sounded the alarm on companies affiliated with China that receive or are qualified for federal subsidies – including through Biden’s IRA.

Moolenaar previously focused on another Chinese firm called Gotion, telling The Midwesterner there are ""about 30 tax credits"" in the law ""Biden calls his Inflation Reduction Act [that] will go to companies who are manufacturing, in some way, green energy.""

Moolenaar’s ""No Gotion Act"" would ensure no subsidies go to firms based in officially designated politically-concerned countries like China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.

He also inserted language in the 2024 funding bill for the Department of Energy that would prohibit the agency from awarding contracts to companies tied to the CCP.

Fox News Digital reached out to Moolenaar for additional comment.

Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., chair of the House Homeland Security Transportation Subcommittee, said at the time that the U.S. cannot continue ""ceding dominance over our critical supply chains to our greatest geopolitical rival.""

Gimenez, who was born in communist Cuba and fled to the U.S. as a child, said Western nations were too slow to recognize threats from Huawei and TikTok, and that doing business in China ensures the CCP will get a cut; ""a steep cost.""

Canadian Solar had about 12,000 employees in China at the beginning of the year with less than 6,000 in the rest of the world combined.

The Coalition for a Prosperous America raised red flags in a report last year on Chinese dominance in the solar industry, and the fact that they’re largely kept afloat by ""massive financial support"" from the Chinese government – with reports citing as much as Y1B ($140M) in subsidies in recent times.

Those subsidies, CPA argued, threaten all solar firms in the West.

Biden Finalizes Crackdown On Us Military Tech Investments In China With One Week To Lame Duck Session

In 2024, Trina Solar, then a subsidiary of a Chinese solar giant by the same name, forged an agreement to sell its Texas-based manufacturing assets to another U.S.-based but Chinese-tied company, which is now known as T1 Energy. Trina Founder Gao Jifan is also a Chinese National People’s Congress delegate.

Gao has several links to CCP-connected organizations, as a profile on the Chinese-controlled search giant Baidu lists several curriculum vitae, including a former vice president of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products – a semi-governmental trade association made up of representatives from several industrial and green-energy corporations like Huawei and Trina Solar.

More recently, in 2023, Gao was vice president of the China Association for the Promotion of Industry-Academic-Research Cooperation, a group under the auspices of the CCP’s Ministry of Science and Technology that connects research universities and manufacturing outfits in the fields of nanotechnology, material manufacturing and green energy.

Trump Is Taking The Fight To The Ccp. It's Long Past Time We Protected Our Bases And Critical Infrastructure

On its homepage, T1 bills itself as ""building domestic solar and battery supply chains to invigorate America with scalable, reliable, and low-cost energy,"" and saying that ""America needs advanced manufacturing capacity to unlock our most scalable energy resources.""

Baidu noted Gao’s investment in a Texas solar module factory, saying he did so to ""prevent the shipment of photovoltaic products from being blocked.""

T1 formed after FREYR Battery, a Norwegian firm, sold off its Texas assets to Trina Solar, which then rebranded the operation as T1 Energy after a restructuring – while FREYR focused on a separate Georgia operation.

Brother-in-law Of Top Dem Senator Played Key Role In Recruiting Chinese Firms To Deep Blue City

T1 positions itself as an ""integrated U.S. supply chain for solar and batteries,"" but remains largely dependent on Trina.

Earlier this month, T1 tweeted a video of robots at its Texas factory, saying that it produced 14MW of solar panels in one day and calling it ""the path to American power.""

Trina Solar, the Chinese company, owns between 16-25% of T1, according to reports, allowing it a minimum of two board members. One member is reportedly a businessman who previously held a deputy directorship at the Chinese Development Bank, a financial powerhouse that helps fund China’s infamous Belt-and-Road Initiative.

Cozy Ties Between Top Newsom Ally And Ccp Official Unearthed On Networking Site: 'She Helped Me A Lot'

A Caribbean-domiciled firm tied to the wife of a Trina executive also holds a stake in T1, potentially offering more Eastern control.

With T1 being a U.S. company eligible for tax credits under the IRA, the company benefits – but also its dependence on Chinese subsidy translates to a CCP-tied firm benefiting from American money.

In Canadian Solar’s case, critics have considered the branding and international dynamic to be geopolitical camouflage, suggesting to Western governments the company is one of their own.

The overall dynamic is one that again depicts China’s persistence in circumventing or manipulating U.S. defenses in various situations, this time in business and investments.

(Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana.
The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.
It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said.
“Today’s inauguration ceremony marks a transformative moment for Iberia Parish,” Iberia Industrial Development Foundation President and CEO Michael J. Tarantino said.
We look forward to seeing “Made in Iberia Parish, Louisiana” come to life.” Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company.","TEMPE, AZ. – First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year. Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s American manufacturing footprint to 14 GW in 2026, and 17.7 GW in 2027, when a recently announced production facility in South Carolina is expected to be fully ramped.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“First Solar’s investment in Iberia Parish represents the kind of forward-looking growth that reinforces Louisiana’s leadership in energy and advanced manufacturing,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “By pairing innovation with our state’s long-standing energy expertise and world-class workforce, this project creates lasting opportunities for Louisiana and bolsters American energy security.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“Today’s inauguration ceremony marks a transformative moment for Iberia Parish,” Iberia Industrial Development Foundation President and CEO Michael J. Tarantino said. “We are grateful for First Solar’s commitment and investment in our community, and we are proud to welcome their contribution to our growing energy portfolio. We look forward to seeing “Made in Iberia Parish, Louisiana” come to life.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

“First Solar’s inauguration marks an incredible milestone for Iberia Parish and the entire Acadiana region,” One Acadiana President & CEO Troy Wayman said. “We’re proud to celebrate alongside both our state and local partners at Louisiana Economic Development and Iberia Industrial Development Foundation as we see this investment come to life — bringing quality jobs, new economic activity, and continued momentum for our manufacturing and energy sectors.”

Federal Activities

On November 21, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released its Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) Annual Report 2025, summarizing 2024 activity. The CFPB received about 207,800 debt collection complaints (7% of all complaints), with “attempts to collect debt not owed” the most common issue and credit card debt the most complained-about category after “I do not know.” Companies responded to 97% of complaints sent to them, most often closing with explanation or non‑monetary relief. Supervisory examinations of larger participants found violations, including failures to provide timely validation notices, use of misleading names and missing required disclosures, contacting consumers at inconvenient times, harassing conduct despite requests to stop, failure to honor requests not to use a specific medium or number, and unfair practices stemming from misdocumented statutes of limitations on credit card debt sold to collectors. Legally, the CFPB and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed amicus briefs, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirming that pay‑to‑pay fees are prohibited unless expressly authorized by agreement or law and a federal court rejecting payoff statement fees. The CFPB withdrew a medical‑debt advisory opinion in 2025. Enforcement activity in 2024 was led by the FTC, while the CFPB announced no public FDCPA actions. The report also details consumer education and outreach (including heavy “Ask CFPB” usage), research on medical collections removal and credit-score impacts, targeted initiatives for older Americans, servicemembers, students, and Native communities, and continued market monitoring and implementation feedback on Regulation F.

On November 21, the Federal Reserve Board announced it will extend the comment period on its proposal to improve stress test model and scenario transparency and accountability until February 21, 2026, citing the need to give interested parties more time to analyze the issues and prepare feedback. The original deadline was January 22, 2026, and the separate deadline for comments on the 2026 stress test scenarios remains December 1, 2025, as outlined in the related Federal Register notice on enhanced transparency and public accountability of supervisory stress test models and scenarios.

On November 21, the Federal Reserve Board released results from its Senior Financial Officer Survey, capturing how banks manage reserve balances and their expectations for balance sheet size and composition, deposit pricing strategies, and developments in stablecoins and digital assets. Conducted with the New York Fed between September 19 and 29, 2025, the survey includes responses from institutions holding roughly three‑quarters of total system reserve balances.

On November 21, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, speaking at the Cleveland Fed’s Financial Stability Conference, said AI’s rapid diffusion could both raise productivity and ease inflationary pressures while also displacing some workers, leaving the net employment effects uncertain and warranting humility in monetary policy as the Fed distinguishes cyclical dynamics from structural change. He assessed the financial system as sound and resilient but noted the Fed’s Financial Stability Report found 30% of market contacts now cite a potential turn in AI sentiment as a salient risk (up from 9% in spring), which could tighten financial conditions. Comparing today to the late‑1990s dot‑com era, Jefferson highlighted key differences: AI‑linked firms generally have established earnings, lower price‑to‑earnings ratios than dot‑com peaks, and a narrower public cohort, with limited leverage so far — though debt financing may rise to fund data centers and talent — making a replay of the dot‑com boom less likely. He concluded that ensuring the AI transition occurs within a stable financial system is essential to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

On November 21, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that its Crypto Task Force has rescheduled the Financial Surveillance and Privacy Roundtable, originally slated for October, to Monday, December 15 from 1 to 5 p.m. ET at SEC headquarters. The event is open to the public, will be webcast on sec.gov, requires registration for in-person attendance (not for online viewing), and, per Task Force Head Commissioner Hester Peirce, aims to advance sound privacy policies and highlight tools that help Americans protect their data. For more information, click here.

On November 20, the CFPB will hand off its remaining enforcement lawsuits and other active litigation to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) as the CFPB prepares for a potential funding lapse. CFPB staff were informed that DOJ will begin assuming matters from the CFPB’s enforcement and legal divisions in the coming weeks, with transfer logistics to be worked out. It remains unclear whether all pending cases will survive the transition or whether case schedules and continuity will be affected. For more information, click here.

On November 20, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, speaking at the ICI Retail Alternatives and Closed‑End Funds Conference, argued that 401(k) plans face a “diversification deficit” and should be able to allocate prudently to private investments — such as private equity, private credit, venture capital, infrastructure, and real estate — to improve risk‑adjusted returns amid rising public‑market concentration and target‑date funds’ typical reliance on open‑end, public strategies. Citing institutional results and modern portfolio theory, he rejected a “zero exposure” presumption, urged ERISA fiduciary guardrails over outright exclusion, noted recent policy moves to broaden access (including the Trump Administration’s executive order), and called for litigation reform to curb hindsight‑driven ERISA suits that chill innovation. Uyeda also pressed for coordinated SEC–Department of Labor frameworks on disclosures, fees, valuation, conflicts, and custody so defined‑contribution savers can access private markets responsibly while maintaining robust investor protections.

On November 20, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry advanced Michael Selig’s nomination to serve as chairman and commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with Senator John Boozman (R-AR) calling it a critical moment as Congress weighs expanding the CFTC’s authority and stressing that strong leadership is essential to implement new policies and responsibilities. Boozman further praised Selig as the right person to strike the balance and urged swift Senate confirmation. Selig’s nomination now heads to the full Senate for consideration.

On November 20, U.S. Representative Warren Davidson (R-OH) introduced the Bitcoin for America Act, which would allow Americans to pay federal taxes in Bitcoin and direct all such payments into a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — an initiative he says will modernize U.S. finance, strengthen long-term resilience, and position the U.S. for global digital asset leadership. Citing Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million-coin supply, record of appreciation versus inflationary currencies, and decentralized, permissionless access that could broaden participation (including among the unbanked), Davidson argues that channeling tax-paid Bitcoin into the Reserve would diversify U.S. assets, protect against dollar erosion, bolster the national balance sheet, and reduce reliance on debt, while ensuring the U.S. keeps pace as other major nations accumulate Bitcoin.

On November 20, U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) released a bipartisan market structure discussion draft that would give the CFTC new authority to regulate the spot market for digital commodities, building on the House-passed CLARITY Act. The draft outlines a CFTC-led regime with a clear definition of “digital commodities,” robust consumer protections (including fund segregation, conflict safeguards, disclosures, and limits on affiliated trading), a trading registration framework to support liquid, resilient markets, mandated CFTC–SEC coordination, protections for self-custody and innovative technology, and a new funding stream for the CFTC to stand up the program. Boozman emphasized that the CFTC is the right agency and pledged to work with colleagues and the administration to ensure sufficient staffing and resources, while Booker highlighted the need to protect consumers and market integrity, and flagged outstanding concerns — including resource adequacy, commissioner balance, preventing regulatory arbitrage, and guardrails against corruption — inviting stakeholder feedback as unresolved issues remain bracketed in the draft.

On November 20, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, speaking at Georgetown’s Psaros Center, said the financial system remains resilient, but highlighted key vulnerabilities such as elevated asset valuations across equities, credit, leveraged loans, and housing; rapid growth and rising complexity in private credit that could transmit losses through leveraged and interconnected funding chains; and the expanding hedge fund footprint in the U.S. Treasury market, where leveraged relative‑value trades funded via short‑term repo could amplify stress during volatility. She also examined generative AI’s implications for market stability, noting potential benefits for price discovery and reduced herding alongside risks of correlated trading, opacity (“black box” concerns), and manipulation, while pointing to improving surveillance and venue safeguards. Cook emphasized that maintaining financial stability is essential to the Fed’s dual mandate and that ongoing monitoring and prudent policy can navigate these emerging risks amid significant technological change.

On November 20, a coalition of digital asset and blockchain organizations sent a letter to President Donald Trump praising first‑year actions (IRS Broker Rule nullification, the GENIUS Act, and rescission of DOL’s 2022 crypto guidance) and urging immediate, whole‑of‑government steps to cement U.S. leadership: Treasury/IRS tax clarity on mining and staking (taxed at disposition), nonrecognition for bridging/wrapping, airdrops/forks/rebases treatment, collateral/liquidation rules, a de minimis exemption for small purchases, streamlined charitable donations, foreign trading safe harbor, R&D credit eligibility, and delaying §6050I rules; regulatory clarity from CFPB (reaffirm broad §1033 data rights and fee ban), the SEC (expedite its agenda; issue no‑action/exemptive relief protecting open, permissionless protocol/front‑end developers; embrace self‑custody), plus safe harbors/sandboxes for DeFi; coordinated SEC–CFTC exemptive relief, Treasury/NIST cyber and illicit‑finance collaboration, updated FinCEN guidance confirming the Bank Secrecy Act does not cover noncustodial software, and disavowal of the proposed “mixing” special measure; and DOJ reforms to end “regulation by prosecution,” extend Section 230‑style protections to DeFi developers, and dismiss charges against Roman Storm, underscoring that publishing open‑source code is protected speech.

On November 19, Trump nominated Stuart Levenbach, an energy official at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to serve a five-year term as permanent director of the CFPB. Levenbach’s experience is in natural resources and energy policy rather than financial regulation, and he would inherit an agency facing profound uncertainty after months of leadership turmoil, enforcement retrenchment, and dwindling finances.The next day, U.S. House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters blasted the nomination as a “sham” aimed at extending CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought’s control of the CFPB without Senate confirmation and furthering an effort to “gut” the agency. She also condemned the administration’s legal theory that the CFPB cannot draw funds from the Federal Reserve and criticized moves to curtail small‑business loan data collection, pledging that Committee Democrats will fight to preserve consumer protections.For more information, click here and here.

On November 19, the Senate Banking Committee voted 13–11 to advance Travis Hill’s nomination to be Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair. Hill, currently acting chair and formerly vice chair, highlighted at his October hearing his role in deregulatory efforts and priorities to refocus supervision on material financial risks over process, strengthen large-bank resolution readiness, and adjust the capital framework. The committee also advanced the nominations of Joseph Gormley to lead Ginnie Mae, Francis Cassidy to be a HUD assistant secretary, and Paul Hollis to be director of the U.S. Mint. For more information, click here.

On November 19, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, and Richard Blumenthal wrote to Vought warning that the CFPB appears poised to gut the bipartisan Personal Financial Data Rights rule finalized in 2024, urging the CFPB to reinstate the rule and preserve consumers’ free access to their own data and the ability to authorize a broad range of third parties to use that data, while prohibiting bank-imposed fees that would choke off competition and harm innovation. The senators cited recent litigation posture changes, industry pressure, and examples of exorbitant access fees as evidence of likely consumer harm and anticompetitive outcomes. Five days earlier, Hill and Vice Chairman Bill Huizenga of the House Financial Services Committee submitted a letter to the CFPB urging robust, consumer-directed data portability under Dodd-Frank §1033, interpreting “representative” to include nonfiduciary entities, anchoring privacy and security in GLBA’s uniform standards to avoid duplicative regimes, and allowing practical flexibility on access methods (including APIs and, where needed, screen scraping) to support smaller institutions. The letter concluded with support for a durable framework that advances consumer control without upending the existing ecosystem. For more information, click here and here.

On November 19, the Office of Financial Research delivered its 2025 Annual Report to Congress, analyzing U.S. financial stability risks and detailing organizational changes over FY 2025 (October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025), including a smaller workforce, budget reductions aligned with administration goals, and efficiency gains from AI. The report highlights persistent technology and cyber vulnerabilities, especially via third‑party providers and propagation across financial and information networks; unusually low corporate debt spreads and stabilizing commercial real estate alongside elevated subprime household delinquencies; fading concerns over banks’ unrealized securities losses, concentrated office‑mortgage credit risk at large banks, and rapidly rising hedge fund borrowing and leverage in macro and relative‑value strategies; resilient market functioning, with Treasury markets performing well amid April volatility, high equity price‑to‑earnings ratios, and robust liquidity from proprietary trading firms; and money‑market developments, including new OFR data collection on non‑centrally cleared bilateral repo, reduced institutional prime money market fund balances, and continued predominance of financial‑firm and asset‑backed commercial paper issuance.

On November 19, the House Financial Services Committee, led by Hill, examined the U.S. deposit insurance framework, weighing proposals to raise coverage limits amid concerns over unclear FDIC data (e.g., account classifications and insured vs. uninsured reporting), implementation costs for smaller banks, and potential moral hazard. Members noted that more than 99% of deposits are already insured under current limits and stressed preserving a diverse banking ecosystem (community, midsize, regional, and GSIBs) while avoiding one-size-fits-all reforms. Witnesses highlighted data gaps and contagion risks in a real‑time, digital environment; warned that accounting choices to spread costs over 10 years could mask reserve‑ratio pressures and expose small banks to special assessments; urged clarity and proportionality to reduce regulatory burden on community banks; and split on raising limits — some opposing broader guarantees as costly and risk‑inducing, others advocating targeted insurance for business operating accounts to reduce run risk and keep local capital working.

On November 19, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs received for Executive Order 12866 review the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) proposed rule titled “Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches; Technical Amendments,” which is at the proposed rule stage and carries no legal deadline.

On November 18, the Federal Reserve Board released new supervisory operating principles to enhance bank supervision by focusing examiners on material financial risks to safety and soundness and taking timely, proportionate action to address them. Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman emphasized the approach “sharpens” rather than narrows supervision, anchoring it in transparency, accountability, and fairness. The principles align examinations and ratings to core financial risks, reduce duplication among supervisors, and streamline remediation of cited issues. The Federal Reserve is training examiners for prompt implementation, and supervision leadership plans to refine and, where appropriate, formalize the principles through public guidance or regulatory changes.

On November 18, Acting CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham delivered a keynote at FIA EXPO outlining the agency’s market‑structure and innovation agenda and a 12‑month “Crypto Sprint” to bring digital assets inside existing U.S. regulatory perimeters: listed spot crypto trading on designated contract markets by year‑end; guidance to enable tokenized collateral, including qualified payment stablecoins, by year‑end with DCOs going live in early 2026; and a rulemaking to make technical amendments for collateral, margin, clearing, settlement, reporting, and recordkeeping to support blockchain/tokenization by August 2026. Pham detailed recent actions to reduce swaps‑market burdens (interpretive letters, procedures, proposed rule amendments, targeted no‑action relief, and withdrawals of legacy proposals), strengthen innovation and oversight (FBOT registration clarity, volatility controls, risk‑management advisories, FCM FAQs, adoption of Nasdaq surveillance), and revive SEC–CFTC coordination (a joint roundtable and harmonization workstreams). She tied the roadmap to the President’s Working Group report and the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin framework, encouraged DCOs/FCMs to treat qualified payment stablecoins and tokenized money market funds as eligible margin and settlement assets with appropriate haircuts, custody, and liquidity safeguards, and emphasized technology‑neutral, activity‑based regulation to modernize U.S. markets without compromising integrity or customer protection.

On November 18, the OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1186 confirming that national banks may pay blockchain “network” or “gas” fees to facilitate otherwise permissible activities and may hold, as principal on balance sheet, the amounts of crypto‑assets reasonably needed to cover anticipated network fees. The letter also permits banks to hold crypto‑assets as principal for testing otherwise permissible crypto‑asset-related platforms (whether developed internally or obtained from third parties), provided all such activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner and comply with applicable law.

On November 17, the U.S. Department of Justice released its 2025 Annual Report to Congress on Activities to Combat Elder Fraud and Abuse, highlighting more than 280 enforcement actions against over 600 defendants, domestic and overseas, who attempted to steal or stole over $2 billion from more than one million older Americans, as well as actions holding multiple nursing home operators accountable for grossly substandard care. The DOJ expanded capacity through the first National Elder Abuse Multidisciplinary Team Summit (nearly 400 participants), recovered or froze millions for victims, and, via VOCA grants, supported more than 4,000 victim assistance organizations serving nearly 200,000 older victims. It also launched the first National Elder Abuse Victim Services Needs Assessment. Public outreach included nearly 1,200 events reaching about 15 million Americans, underscoring DOJ’s commitment to enforcement, victim services, capacity building, and prevention.

On November 17, the FTC announced a final order permanently banning Seek Capital and its CEO from offering business financing, debt relief, and credit repair services after the agency alleged the firm deceived entrepreneurs by promising loans or lines of credit and instead charging thousands to open credit cards while harming credit scores and imposing undisclosed fees. A federal court granted most of the FTC’s summary judgment, finding misrepresentations that violated the FTC Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule, contracts that violated the Consumer Review Fairness Act, and Ferman’s personal liability. The order imposes a $48,280,328 monetary judgment (partially suspended for inability to pay, due in full if finances are misrepresented), bars misrepresentations, billing without informed consent, TSR violations, and restrictions on consumer reviews, and was approved 3–0 by the commission.

On November 14, the Federal Reserve issued its 35th annual Report to Congress on the profitability of credit card operations, finding that specialized “credit card banks” posted a 2024 pretax return on assets of 3.87% (up from 3.31% in 2023) driven by higher interest income and reduced loan-loss provisioning (3.62% vs. 3.92%), far outpacing the 1.38% ROA for all banks. The report notes eight monoline credit card banks held 29% of balances at year-end 2024 (down from 42 banks holding 77% in 1996), with top 10 issuers now controlling 83% of balances, consumers carrying $1.4 trillion in revolving credit against more than $5 trillion in available limits, and market activity totaling 64.5 billion transactions and over $6.2 trillion in volume. Delinquencies rose early in 2024 before edging down, while charge-offs remained above pre-pandemic norms. Acquisition has shifted heavily to digital channels (with 2.8 billion direct-mail offers still significant), and usage trends include buy-now-pay-later growth and post‑transaction installment features. On pricing, average nominal rates across all accounts held near 21.5% and about 22.8% for accounts incurring interest at year-end 2024, despite a decline in the two‑year Treasury yield to roughly 4.2%, underscoring sustained high APRs amid evolving credit card market structure and regulation.

On November 13, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in coordination with the Government of Mexico, targeted the Hysa Organized Crime Group (HOCG) and cartel-linked money laundering through Mexico’s gambling sector, with OFAC sanctioning 27 individuals and entities, including HOCG family members and key businesses, thereby blocking their U.S. property and prohibiting U.S. persons from transacting with them, and warning of potential secondary sanctions for foreign financial institutions. Concurrently, FinCEN proposed a USA PATRIOT Act section 311 special measure to cut off 10 named Mexico-based gambling establishments from the U.S. financial system by restricting correspondent account use and requiring heightened due diligence to guard against laundering. Treasury underscored that sanctions aim to change behavior and outlined the process for removal from the SDN List, while inviting public comment on FinCEN’s NPRM via regulations.gov.

State Activities

On November 20, the Illinois Supreme Court narrowly construed private rights of action under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), creating a de facto “concrete injury” requirement for claims under the FCRA and potentially other federal statutes with similar language authorizing rights of action. Although Article III’s concrete-injury requirement has become familiar in federal courts over the last decade, Illinois courts had not previously imposed such a requirement in cases involving statutory rights of action. The court in Fausett v. Walgreen Co., held that the FCRA does not explicitly authorize consumers to sue for violations, so the law did not authorize consumer lawsuits unless the consumer could show that a violation caused them a concrete injury. This ruling will significantly narrow consumers’ ability to bring no-injury claims under similar statutes in Illinois state courts.

The Genesis Mission will transform American science and innovation through the power of artificial intelligence (AI), strengthening the nation’s technological leadership and global competitiveness.

The ambitious mission will harness the current AI and advanced computing revolution to double the productivity and impact of American science and engineering within a decade. It will deliver decisive breakthroughs to secure American energy dominance, accelerate scientific discovery, and strengthen national security.

“Throughout history, from the Manhattan Project to the Apollo mission, our nation’s brightest minds and industries have answered the call when their nation needed them,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Today, the United States is calling on them once again. Under President Trump’s leadership, the Genesis Mission will unleash the full power of our National Laboratories, supercomputers, and data resources to ensure that America is the global leader in artificial intelligence and to usher in a new golden era of American discovery.”

The announcement builds on President Trump’s Executive Order Removing Barriers to American Leadership In Artificial Intelligence and advances his America’s AI Action Plan released earlier this year—a directive to remove barriers to innovation, reduce dependence on foreign adversaries, and unleash the full strength of America’s scientific enterprise.

Secretary Wright has designated Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil to lead the initiative. The Genesis Mission will mobilize the Department of Energy’s 17 National Laboratories, industry, and academia to build an integrated discovery platform.

The platform will connect the world’s best supercomputers, AI systems, and next-generation quantum systems with the most advanced scientific instruments in the nation. Once complete, the platform will be the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built. It will draw on the expertise of roughly 40,000 DOE scientists, engineers, and technical staff, alongside private sector innovators, to ensure that the United States leads and builds the technologies that will define the future.

The Genesis Mission will focus on addressing three key challenges of national importance:

American energy dominance: The Genesis Mission will accelerate advanced nuclear, fusion, and grid modernization using AI to provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy for Americans.

Advancing discovery science: Through DOE’s investment and collaboration with industry, America is building the quantum ecosystem that will power discoveries—and industries—for decades to come.

Ensuring national security: DOE will create advanced AI technologies for national security missions, deploy systems to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, and accelerate the development of defense-ready materials.

Additional quotes for media:

Under Secretary for Science and Genesis Mission Director, Dr. Darío Gil: “The Genesis Mission marks a defining moment for the next era of American science. We are linking the nation’s most advanced facilities, data, and computing into one closed-loop system to create a scientific instrument for the ages, an engine for discovery that doubles R&D productivity and solves challenges once thought impossible.”

Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Brandon Williams: “The Genesis Mission represents the next great chapter and an unparallelled opportunity for America’s scientific and national security leadership. “Building on decades of innovation and collaboration across our national laboratories, NNSA will leverage AI, quantum computing, and advanced data analytics that will strengthen our deterrents and ensure the United States maintains an unmatched strategic edge over our adversaries. Under President Trump’s leadership, this mission will embody the very best of American ingenuity, turning science and innovation into security.”",https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/DOE%20Full%20Seal%20on%20white%20gray%20background%20-%201250x785_1.png,N,,2025-11-25 17:01:47.792797

EPA has twice extended the initial reporting deadline, most recently to April 2026.
Earlier this month, the EPA under the Trump administration proposed several significant exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule to reduce compliance costs and burdens for regulated entities.
Imported Articles.
PFAS imported as part of a manufactured item, such as a textile, that has an end-use function dependent on its shape or design and that does not have any commercially relevant change of chemical composition during use.","In October 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) adopted a rule requiring per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) manufacturers and importers to “submit information to EPA regarding PFAS uses, production volumes, byproducts, disposal, exposures, and existing information on environmental and health effects” from PFAS or PFAS-containing imported articles between 2011 and 2022. The stated rationale was that it would allow EPA to “better characterize the sources and quantities” of “PFAS in the United States.” Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, 40 C.F.R. § 705 (2023). The reporting rule’s lengthy lookback period and the breadth of information and activities it covers have presented challenges for regulated entities, including spending resources to determine whether they are subject to the rule and what information is reportable. EPA has twice extended the initial reporting deadline, most recently to April 2026.

Earlier this month, the EPA under the Trump administration proposed several significant exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule to reduce compliance costs and burdens for regulated entities. The proposed exemptions would include:

De Minimis. PFAS in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent.

Imported Articles. PFAS imported as part of a manufactured item, such as a textile, that has an end-use function dependent on its shape or design and that does not have any commercially relevant change of chemical composition during use.

Byproducts, Impurities and Non-Isolated Intermediates. Typically, PFAS that emerge as byproducts of a manufacturing process (not used for commercial purposes).

Research and Development (“R&D”) Chemicals. PFAS manufactured (including imported) in small quantities for R&D purposes.

,American Energy,2025-11-25 17:40:41+00:00,Waste Today,American Biogas Council releases biogas energy data on food waste - Waste Today -,"Audrey Trevarthan, Assistant Editor",,,,,https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/article/american-biogas-council-releases-biogas-energy-data-on-food-waste/,"Approaching Thanksgiving, the Washington-based American Biogas Council (ABC) has released new data highlighting the growth of biogas systems that convert food waste into energy.
ABC says American households throw away about 26 million tons of food each year, while food processors, grocers and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.
ABC says prevention is the best strategy to reduce food waste.
As of this month, ABC says 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19 percent increase over the past five years.
In addition, ABC says 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.","Approaching Thanksgiving, the Washington-based American Biogas Council (ABC) has released new data highlighting the growth of biogas systems that convert food waste into energy.

On Thanksgiving Day, Americans will throw away about 160,000 tons of food scraps, representing $550 million worth of food tossed in a single day, according to ReFED. ABC says American households throw away about 26 million tons of food each year, while food processors, grocers and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.

ABC says prevention is the best strategy to reduce food waste. However, biogas systems help ensure that discarded food is used productively. These systems capture the energy from surplus food and other organic material, like manure and wastewater solids, as they break down. Biogas facilities use anaerobic digestion to recycle waste into energy that can be used to power and heat homes, fuel vehicles or generate electricity through engines and fuel cells.

As of this month, ABC says 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19 percent increase over the past five years. ABC found that 118 of these facilities recycle food waste only, handling over 10 million tons of pre- and postconsumer inedible scraps each year.

Wastewater treatment plants and farm-based biogas systems also recycle discarded food. ABC counts 124 wastewater plants in the U.S. that combine food waste with wastewater solids to generate energy, recycling an additional 1.1 million tons of wasted food each year. In addition, ABC says 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.

In total, these facilities recycle 12.8 million tons of food scraps and other organic waste into more than 35 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of biogas a year, which ABC says is enough to cover the year-long energy use of 283,000 U.S. households.

“The U.S. still overlooks the enormous value in food processing scraps and inedible food,” says ABC Executive Director Patrick Serfass. “Biogas facilities can convert this waste into enough home-grown energy to supply the needs of millions of Americans, while creating jobs and catalyzing new, local investments. We hope more municipalities and industrial food processors will choose to invest in biogas systems to recycle their resources locally.”

Looking into the future, ABC says if three-quarters of the discarded food from homes, grocers, restaurants and food processors were recycled in biogas systems, that wasted material could turn into 115 Bcf of biogas per year, equivalent to the energy needs of nearly one million U.S households.

The company will invest approximately $20 million to establish a new sub-assembly production operation in Asheboro.

“North Carolina continues to be a leader in advanced manufacturing, and Environmental Air Systems’ expansion to Randolph County reflects the strength and talent of our workforce,” said Governor Josh Stein. “This project will create hundreds of new jobs, support local families, and strengthen our state’s role in innovative industrial solutions.”

Environmental Air Systems (EAS), a subsidiary of Comfort Systems USA, Inc., will expand its operations to meet growing demand for specialized prefabricated equipment for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems in critical facilities. Operating in the Triad region of the state since 1953, the company’s new facility will produce sub-assemblies for industries including mission-critical, pharmaceutical, data center, semiconductor, and healthcare. The site will be 300,000 square feet of manufacturing space to serve both regional and national markets.

“EAS is proud to announce the continued expansion of our operations in North Carolina,” said Allen Absher, President of EAS - Manufacturing. “For over 70 years, we have been a dedicated part of the business community in this state and are fortunate to be in a position to generate more local employment opportunities. EAS is steadfast in its commitment to provide our customers with state-of-the-art, complex projects and to build an enduring legacy for our employees.”

“EAS’s decision to expand into Asheboro demonstrates the growing demand for North Carolina’s skilled workforce and business-friendly environment,” said North Carolina Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “This project will drive economic growth and enhance our state’s competitiveness in advanced modular manufacturing.”

The EPA’s court filing asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to strike down the soot standard.

Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, results in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources like vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.

Corporations and dozens of state attorneys general sued shortly after, though the rule is projected to result in billions of dollars in health benefits, prevent thousands of premature deaths, and deliver cleaner air to millions of people, particularly those living near highways, factories, and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of Healthy Communities at Earthjustice. “Trump has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money, and this administration’s EPA has nothing to do with protecting people's health, saving lives, or serving children, families or communities. We will continue to defend this life-saving standard.”

“The public health and economic benefits of the current standard are tangible,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at Clean Air Task Force. “By EPA’s own estimate, the current PM NAAQS would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits, and 4,500 premature deaths – adding up to $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act.”

The EPA has never before abandoned its legal defense of a strengthened national ambient air quality standard. The agency and Department of Justice had previously vigorously defended the standard as recently as December 2024. Despite EPA’s filing endorsing some of the challengers’ legal arguments, the science remains clear that the prior standard allowed significant human health harms to occur, including numerous deaths, and needed to be strengthened to protect public health. The standard also remains in effect and is firmly within EPA’s legal scope, supported by the EPA’s own scientific evidence.

The EPA found that meeting the stronger standard would provide benefits for public health valued at $46 billion each year once all areas come into compliance, while costing less than 1.5% of that amount. There are many commonsense and low-cost solutions to reduce pollution from large industrial sources. Earthjustice analyzed polluters’ faulty claims about predicted impacts of the new standard and found that they were based on flawed analysis. Cleaner air and economic growth have gone hand in hand after past air standard improvements. And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.

Air pollution is a serious problem, especially for children, and Black communities and other people of color breathe in more of it, and face higher rates of asthma, heart disease, and premature death. Studies show that Black communities are exposed to roughly 1.5 times more deadly soot pollution than white communities.

In April, a coalition of 100 environmental, public health, and community groups urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to uphold and swiftly implement the 2024 soot standard, warning that any delay would endanger already overburdened communities.

The Montana Environmental Information Center, or MEIC, on Friday urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reject a 370-MW power purchase agreement between NorthWestern Colstrip and Mercuria Energy America, a power marketing and trading company.

The issue centers on the changing ownership of the 1,480-MW coal-fired Colstrip power plant in Montana and concerns that NorthWestern Energy retail customers would be forced to subsidize the cost of service under the PPA.

Puget Sound Energy is set to transfer its 370-MW stake on Jan. 1 to NorthWestern Energy for zero dollars. Separately, NorthWestern is also acquiring Avista’s 222-MW stake in the power plant at no cost on the same day.

When the deals are closed, NorthWestern will own 70% of the Colstrip power plant, NorthWestern Energy Group said in an Oct. 30 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

NorthWestern expects it will be able to use the PSE stake in the plant to sell power to future large load customers, but in the meantime has entered into the Mercuria PPA, the company said in the filing.

NorthWestern said it expects the Mercuria PPA will “largely offset” the roughly $30 million in annual operating and maintenance costs related to owning the PSE capacity. The PPA is set to run from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2027, according to NorthWestern Colstrip’s application at FERC.

However, MEIC contends that the application is flawed in two ways.

First, NorthWestern failed to get FERC’s approval for its acquisition of PSE’s stake in the power plant, according to the advocacy group. The Federal Power Act’s section 203 requires FERC approval of transactions, such as buying and selling power plants, that are valued at more than $10 million, MEIC said.

Although NorthWestern is acquiring PSE’s stake in the power for zero dollars, the capacity is worth at least $10 million, according to MEIC. NorthernWestern, for example, expects to reap roughly $30 million a year in revenue under its Mercuria PPA, the group said.

Second, NorthWestern failed to show that its utility customers wouldn’t inappropriately cross-subsidize NorthWestern Colstrip, according to MEIC.

“The below-cost rate NorthWestern Colstrip proposes to charge Mercuria raises an acute concern that NorthWestern Energy’s retail customers will subsidize the cost of service for the wholesale affiliate,” MEIC said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-qrIafKystmfeHYhsNweTnpSmebuehhr4fg9i4kiFWE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODEwODUyNTIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-25 13:01:12.254507

In summary

California utilities regulators are bringing down “return on equity” payments to power company shareholders. It’s the lowest profit margin in 20 years for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but will be hard to notice in your payments.

With California electric rates stuck at nearly the highest in the nation, the state’s utility regulator is poised to lower the payout shareholders can receive from California’s three large investor-owned power companies.

In a proposed decision, the California Public Utilities Commission recommended dropping the “return on equity” by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. If approved, shareholders of all three companies would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. Such returns for PG&E and Edison haven’t dipped below double digits in at least 20 years.

Utilities said the decline would affect their ability to bring in needed investment for their work. Critics of the decision said that the decline is too small to meaningfully impact ratepayers’ bills, even if it’s a step in the right direction.

“California and other [public utility commissions] authorize rates of return that are far in excess of the statutory requirement,” said Mark Ellis, former chief economist at Sempra, which owns San Diego Gas & Electric.

The California Public Utility Commission is expected to vote on the decision in December.

Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A number of factors go into those rates, including wildfire mitigation costs. PG&E in particular has attracted the ire of California customers for its frequent rate hikes within the last year.

Baked into those bills is the return on equity, money meant to compensate shareholders for the risk of doing business. These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%. If approved, PG&E’s rate would be 9.93% (down from 10.28%), Edison would be 9.98% (down from 10.33%), and San Diego Gas & Electric would be 9.88% (down from 10.23%). These rates are not automatically guaranteed – utilities can fall short of this return if they don’t keep down costs, such as project overruns or unexpected lawsuit fees.

A small change in this rate can be a difference of millions of dollars for ratepayers. The return is a percentage of the rate base, the total value of a utility’s assets it can earn a return on; this includes projects such as building a new power plant, for example. The rate bases for California’s three large investor-owned utilities have steadily grown each year as they add new customers and projects, increasing the amount that shareholders can receive.

PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million. Had it been 1% lower, the potential return would have been $12.5 million less.

“The proposed cost of capital decision needs refinement to better reflect California’s unique risks and market realities,” said Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford. “Making those refinements in the final decision will enhance SCE’s ability to finance essential infrastructure projects for a more reliable, resilient and ready electric grid.”

PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison echoed this sentiment, saying the decision “fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems.”

Anthony Wagner, spokesperson at San Diego Gas & Electric, said, “A decision that accurately reflects these realities is essential to enabling investments that reduce wildfire risk, strengthen reliability, replace aging infrastructure and advance California’s clean energy transition for the benefit of the communities we serve.”

Utilities routinely request these rates be pushed higher because they are a key part of what goes into utilities’ credit rating, affecting the interest they pay on loans for infrastructure investments. But in recent years, experts and consumer advocates point to a mismatch – the utility industry is typically considered low-risk, but critics say the shareholder return rates don’t reflect that. Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates. And it’s costing utility ratepayers across the country as much as $7 billion annually, according to academics.

Ellis, the former Sempra economist, said there is a way to lower shareholder returns while keeping customer bills in check and maintaining credit ratings that the commission has not yet explored – changing the balance of debt and equity each utility has.

“You really need to understand credit,” he said. “This is where they’re going to get you.”

The commission is allowed to set the debt-equity balance when it determines shareholder returns, but it left this unchanged for all three utilities in its proposed decision for 2026. Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.",https://lostcoastoutpost.com/loco-media/cache/18/bb/18bbce40fd30c6a257827246c45251f7.webp,N,,2025-11-25 14:02:06.166354

And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.

“EPA’s soot standards are life-saving protections that are firmly grounded in bedrock Clean Air Act legal authority.
We will continue to vigorously defend these vital safeguards.” – Peter Zalzal, distinguished counsel and associate vice president for Clean Air Strategies, Environmental Defense Fund.","—

Last night, in an unprecedented move, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave up defending the national, health-based limits on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), also known as soot, that EPA strengthened last year. The EPA’s court filing asks the U.S, Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to strike down the soot standard.

Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, results in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources like vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 — or the soot standards — are a cornerstone of the Clean Air Act. After over a decade without updates, the EPA followed the advice of independent experts and extensive scientific evidence and strengthened the annual soot standard to better protect public health, reducing the allowable level from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. Corporations and dozens of state attorneys general sued shortly after, though the rule is projected to result in billions of dollars in health benefits, prevent thousands of premature deaths, and deliver cleaner air to millions of people, particularly those living near highways, factories, and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of Healthy Communities at Earthjustice. “Trump has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money, and this administration’s EPA has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives, or serving children, families, or communities. We will continue to defend this life-saving standard.”

“The public health and economic benefits of the current standard are tangible,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at Clean Air Task Force. “By EPA’s own estimate, the current PM NAAQS would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits, and 4,500 premature deaths — adding up to $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act.”

The EPA has never before abandoned its legal defense of a strengthened national ambient air quality standard. The agency and Department of Justice had previously vigorously defended the standard as recently as December 2024. Despite EPA’s filing endorsing some of the challengers’ legal arguments, the science remains clear that the prior standard allowed significant human health harms to occur, including numerous deaths, and needed to be strengthened to protect public health. The standard also remains in effect and is firmly within EPA’s legal scope, supported by the EPA’s own scientific evidence.

The EPA found that meeting the stronger standard would provide benefits for public health valued at $46 billion each year once all areas come into compliance, while costing less than 1.5% of that amount. There are many commonsense and low-cost solutions to reduce pollution from large industrial sources. Earthjustice analyzed polluters’ faulty claims about predicted impacts of the new standard and found that they were based on flawed analysis. Cleaner air and economic growth have gone hand in hand after past air standard improvements. And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.

Air pollution is a serious problem, especially for children, and Black communities and other people of color breathe in more of it, and face higher rates of asthma, heart disease, and premature death. Studies show that Black communities are exposed to roughly 1.5 times more deadly soot pollution than white communities.

In April, a coalition of 100 environmental, public health, and community groups urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to uphold and swiftly implement the 2024 soot standard, warning that any delay would endanger already overburdened communities.

Earthjustice, its clients, and partners intervened last year to defend the soot standard against court challenges from polluters and their allies. Earthjustice clients are Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Lung Association, Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition, Rio Grande International Study Center, and Sierra Club. Clean Air Task Force represents Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future and Conservation Law Foundation.

“Our communities already carry the burden of polluted air and higher rates of asthma and heart disease. Weakening soot protections will only deepen these disparities and cost more Black lives,” said Yvonka Hall, executive director of the Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition.

“In the border region, families breathe air laced with pollution from trucks, refineries, and factories. This decision puts our health and our children’s future at even greater risk,” said Tricia Cortez, executive director of the Rio Grande International Study Center.

“As nurses, we see the toll air pollution takes on our patients — especially kids and older adults. Gutting science-based standards puts lives in danger and public health on the line,” said Katie Huffling, DNP, RN, CNM, FAAN executive director from the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

“Instead of enforcing clean air protections, EPA is cynically partnering with big polluters to bypass public input and dismantle the laws that safeguard the air we all breathe. It ignores the clear science telling us that this choice will be deadly,” said John Walke, senior attorney and director of federal clean air at NRDC.

The facility would include around 180,000 lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries stored in three specially designed, 30-foot tall “low profile” buildings.

According to Vistra representatives, another benefit of the site selection is that it would have connected to Pacific Gas & Electric’s (PG&E’s) active transmission lines. Three new project-level substations would link to PG&E’s existing substation, which was originally built to draw electricity from the existing gas power plant.

After facing delays with the local municipal permitting process, Vistra Energy decided to seek approval from the CEC to build the BESS under the provisions of Assembly Bill (AB) 205.

On 28 October 2024, Vistra issued the Morro Bay City Council with a letter requesting a pause on municipal review of the standalone BESS project, opting instead to use the CEC’s streamlined certification process.

AB 205, signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom in 2022, expanded the CEC’s authority to include permitting BESS facilities exceeding 200MWh, offering developers an alternative pathway for approval through the ‘Opt-In’ programme – effectively bypassing the need for local authority permitting.

Earlier this year, CPUC established new standards for the maintenance and operation of battery energy storage facilities.

The CPUC modified General Order 167, which provides a method for implementing and enforcing maintenance and operation standards for electric generating facilities.

Additional changes to operating BESS in California were quickly introduced the week followingthe Moss Landing fire. Local politician Dawn Addis, California Assembly member for the 30th District which includes part of Monterey County, introduced AB 303, also known as the ‘Battery Energy Safety & Accountability Act’.

The Act proposed removing rules that allow the ‘Opt-In’ programme. Addis’ bill failed to make it past the first reading and missed the house of origin deadline.

In March, ESN published an article about a solar-plus-storage project with a 4.6GWh BESS that progressed through the Opt-In programme, in which we included a roundup of all eight projects making use of the programme at the time (Premium access).

By early 2026, there will likely be a final CSRD/CSDDD Omnibus that amends the current CSRD and CSDDD rules, and which Member States must then transpose into national law applicable to companies.","After months of uncertainty, the outlook for key EU sustainability laws is far clearer.

On November 13, 2025, the European Parliament adopted its negotiating position on the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) Omnibus simplification. This follows the European Commission’s Omnibus proposal in February (see more here) and the Council of the EU’s negotiating mandate in June (see more here). “Trilogue” negotiations between the three institutions began on November 18, 2025, with the aim of finalizing the legislation by the end of 2025 (see four-column document here).

This post uses the Parliament’s position as the basis to set out some of the key points on the CSRD and CSDDD that have been the focus of debate. It also flags some key outstanding discrepancies between the Parliament and Council positions which will need to be ironed out in the Trilogue negotiations. So while the legislative journey is not yet over, the emerging alignment on these texts is finally coming into greater focus. As a result, companies are now starting to reinvigorate their efforts to prepare for compliance, given the significant areas of convergence between the Parliament and Council (flagged in brackets below) and confirmation that both institutions continue to support the extraterritorial application of the CSRD and CSDDD to certain non-EU parent companies.

CSDDD

Applicability Thresholds (Parliament and Council aligned):

For EU-incorporated companies: 5,000+ employees and over EUR 1.5 billion in net worldwide turnover (on a consolidated basis for EU ultimate parent companies of corporate groups).

For non-EU-incorporated companies: EUR 1.5 billion in net turnover generated in the EU (on a consolidated basis for non-EU ultimate parent companies of corporate groups).

Timing (Parliament and Council not aligned):

Application: The Parliament proposes to maintain the CSDDD application timeline set out in the Commission’s “Stop the Clock” proposal, i.e., obligations will apply to all in-scope companies starting July 26, 2028. The Council, in contrast, proposes postponing the CSDDD’s application by another year, to July 26, 2029.

Transposition: The Parliament maintains the Commission position on the Member State transposition deadline (July 26, 2027), whereas the Council would also push this by a year (July 26, 2028).

Level of Harmonization (Parliament and Council partially aligned): All three institutions propose a significantly broader harmonization of CSDDD obligations across the Member States. Parliament proposes the most extensive harmonization with mandatory alignment for all provisions from Articles 6 to 16. Parliament also proposes deleting the provision that would allow Member States to introduce more stringent or more specific due diligence obligations. This expanded harmonization would substantially reduce the risk of fragmented national requirements across the EU.

Changes to Due Diligence Obligations (Parliament and Council not aligned): The main focus of recent debates has been the required approach to identification and assessment of adverse impacts (under Article 8). Some of the key areas of divergence are as follows:

Broader Value Chain Scope and Risk-Based Approach to the Identification and Assessment of Adverse Impacts: The Parliament proposes requiring a company to cover the entire in-scope chain of activities (including both direct and indirect business partners) when identifying and assessing adverse human rights and environmental impacts. Rather than limiting the due diligence obligations to specific “tiers” of the supply chain, the Parliament position emphasizes a risk-based approach that takes into account relevant risk factors. This is in contrast to the Commission and Council positions which seek to introduce a two-tiered approach that limits impact assessment obligations to a company’s own operations, its subsidiaries, and direct business partners in the chain of activities (with additional triggers for when indirect business partners may be included).

Reframed Risk Identification and Assessment Steps: The Parliament’s position reframes and somewhat limits the risk identification and assessment requirements:

Step One: Companies must first carry out a “scoping” exercise (revising the Commission’s “mapping exercise”), relying solely on “already reasonably available information” to identify general areas where adverse impacts are most likely to occur and most severe. During this initial phase, companies are expressly not required to request information from their business partners.

Step Two: Based on the results of their scoping exercise, companies would only proceed to a “further assessment” (replacing and limiting the Council’s “in-depth assessment”) where, based on “relevant and verifiable information,” they have “grounds to believe” that adverse impacts may arise or have arisen, and only in the areas that were previously identified to be most likely to occur and most severe.

Value Chain Information Cap: For the purposes of further assessments in “Step Two” above, companies must only seek information from business partners where necessary, and never in the areas where no likely and severe risks were identified. To protect smaller companies from burdensome requests, in-scope companies can only request additional information from business partners with fewer than 5,000 employees (in contrast to the Council’s 1,000 employee cap) as a last resort, and only if that information cannot reasonably be obtained by other means. All information requests must be targeted, reasonable, and proportionate.

Other Substantive Obligations (Parliament and Council aligned in key areas): While the nature of the other substantive obligations (Articles 9–16) is broadly aligned between the Parliament and Council positions, some differences must still be resolved. For example, in Articles 10 and 11, the Parliament has proposed that it will always be voluntary for a company to suspend a relationship with a business partner as a way to prevent or end adverse impacts (the Commission proposed these “last resort” measures as mandatory). The Parliament also proposes to shorten Article 15’s regular due diligence assessment interval to four years, in contrast to the five-year interval proposed by the Commission and Council.

Climate Transition Plans (“CTPs”) (Parliament and Council not aligned): The Parliament’s proposal removes the mandatory CTP requirement entirely by deleting Article 22. This differs from the Council’s position, which maintains the obligation for companies to have a CTP, albeit with reduced obligations.

Civil Liability (Parliament and Council aligned): Both the Parliament and Council support the Commission’s proposal to remove the mandatory EU-wide civil liability regime. Civil liability for CSDDD breaches would still be subject to the rules and procedures of each Member State’s national court system.

Penalties (Parliament and Council aligned): Both the Parliament and Council require the Commission, together with Member States, to develop penalty-setting guidance for supervisory authorities. The Parliament clarifies that this guidance should spell out the “appropriate level” of penalties, a requirement not included in the Council’s text. Instead, the Council’s position includes a mandatory “cap” on penalties in the operative provision. However, in the Recitals the Parliament also agrees with the Council that the maximum limit for pecuniary penalties should be set at 5% of the net worldwide turnover.

CSRD

Applicability Thresholds (Parliament and Council not aligned):

For EU companies: The Parliament’s proposal increases the proposed employee threshold to 1,750+ employees (the Council sets the threshold at 1,000+ employees). The Parliament maintains the Council’s proposed turnover requirement of over EUR 450 million.

For non-EU ultimate parent companies: The Parliament’s proposal limits applicability to non-EU ultimate parent companies that have an EU-incorporated subsidiary or branch in the EU that generates more than EUR 450 million in net turnover. The Council maintains the prior structure of the threshold that requires (i) a large EU subsidiary or branch and (ii) the non-EU parent to generate more than EUR 450 million of turnover “in the EU.”

The Parliament proposes to exempt from direct reporting requirements “financial holding” companies that have the sole purpose of acquiring and managing shares in other companies, without directly or indirectly being involved in the management of those companies. The subsidiaries of those companies may have reporting requirements, if they meet the applicability requirements in their own right.

Separately, on November 13, 2025, a Delegated Regulation entered into force that provides reporting relief for companies that were required to publish CSRD sustainability statements on FY 2024 data (Wave 1 companies). Applying retroactively from January 1, 2025, the Delegated Regulation ensures that companies in the first wave of CSRD reporting will not be required to disclose additional information when reporting on FY 2025 and FY 2026 data beyond what was in their FY 2024 sustainability statements.

ESRS (“European Sustainability Reporting Standards”): The Parliament’s position broadly aligns with the Commission’s proposal and the Council’s position that reporting standards must be simplified and reduced. The Parliament also tasks the Commission with developing sector-specific guidelines to assist voluntary sector-specific reporting. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (“EFRAG”) has announced that the next draft of the simplified ESRS will be released on December 4, 2025. EFRAG’s initial proposal for revisions in the Amended ESRS confirm that the CSRD’s distinct double materiality assessment will be preserved (albeit streamlined), and both the Council and the Parliament ask that the Commission provides further clarity on the application of the double materiality principle when it adopts the Amended ESRS as a delegated act.

Value Chain Information Cap: The Parliament proposes that companies reporting under the CSRD are not allowed to request information from companies with an average of less than 1,750 employees and a net turnover of EUR 450 million, beyond what is required under the voluntary reporting standard for non-listed micro, small and medium enterprises (“VSME”). By comparison, the Council limited this cap to companies not exceeding an average of 1,000 employees. This cap will only apply to information requests for CSRD reporting purposes, and not to other commercial information exchanges.

Taxonomy Reporting: As in the current CSRD, only companies within the proposed scope of CSRD reporting (which varies among the three institutions) will be required to report under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. The Parliament and the Council agree to delete the Commission’s proposed option to report on partial Taxonomy alignment.

We expect to see growing clarity on these outstanding questions over the coming weeks. By early 2026, there will likely be a final CSRD/CSDDD Omnibus that amends the current CSRD and CSDDD rules, and which Member States must then transpose into national law applicable to companies.

Last week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead of burning fossil fuels.

“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”

The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.

The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.

New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.

At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.

“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.

The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.

The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.

The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.

These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.

“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”

Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.

Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.

The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5 million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.

The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.

The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.

The third major area of the accelerator is a resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.

Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.

“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/heatpumpcanary-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:02:33.099432

Market Drivers

Government Incentives and Regulations

The United States has implemented a series of policies to accelerate the adoption of electric commercial vehicles (ECVs). Incentives such as tax credits, grants, and rebates for fleet operators and vehicle manufacturers reduce the upfront cost of adopting ECVs. Stringent emissions regulations encourage a shift away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and federal initiatives like the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program mandate fleet electrification, making ECVs essential for regulatory compliance. These measures provide a stable demand for ECVs, particularly among logistics and public transportation operators seeking sustainable and regulatory-compliant solutions. For instance, in 2023 leasing models allowed electric cars to qualify for relaxed commercial vehicle tax credits. Savings were passed to leaseholders, boosting EV adoption. This strategy supported sustained rollouts.

Key Market Challenges

High Upfront Costs

The initial cost of electric commercial vehicles remains a barrier despite declining battery prices. ECVs are generally more expensive than their ICE counterparts due to the cost of advanced batteries and associated technologies. Fleet operators often face budget constraints that make the transition to ECVs challenging, particularly for small businesses.

Even with incentives, the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculation, factoring in charging infrastructure and maintenance, can deter adoption. Addressing these financial barriers requires scalable production and economies of scale to further reduce manufacturing costs.

Key Market Trends

Adoption of Electric Delivery Vans and Trucks

The increasing focus on last-mile delivery efficiency is driving the adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks. Companies in the logistics and retail sectors are prioritizing these vehicles for urban deliveries to reduce emissions and operational costs.

According to the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE), electric delivery vans used by fleets like FedEx and UPS demonstrated 30-50% lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to internal combustion vehicles in urban use cases.

Earlier this year, Westinghouse publicly shared its plan with the White House to have 10 of its state-of-the-art AP1000 nuclear reactors under construction by 2030. The new reactors would help address growing demands on the U.S. energy grid from AI and other sources, and when completed, they would provide enough combined power to electrify 7.5 million households. That’s roughly every household in the five largest U.S. cities plus a few data centers.

Yet reactor construction has slowed down in recent decades due to complex approvals and building processes. To reach its ambitious goal, Westinghouse has partnered with Google Cloud to develop a custom AI-powered platform using specialized models from both Google and Westinghouse — itself a leader in AI for energy production — that helps optimize and accelerate reactor construction.

So far, early pilots of the platform have shown significant time and cost savings, and the companies are also exploring ways for AI to help enhance nuclear operations and safety. Here’s a closer look.

AI fuels itself

The partnership is driven by a pressing global challenge of meeting the ever-increasing energy demands with carbon free power. Dr. Lou Martinez Sancho, Westinghouse's CTO and Executive Vice President of R&D and Innovation, framed the core idea as ""energy for AI and AI for energy.""

Nuclear is notable for offering clean, reliable power at an immense scale from a small footprint. With the United States projected to need 400 gigawatts of new power by 2040 — a 32% increase from current usage — conventional construction timelines are insufficient.

A foundation for AI

Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner has stressed that AI-driven decision-making optimization is essential to making nuclear power a viable investment for utilities and addressing energy urgency. A major factor in the partnership’s success has been Westinghouse's AI readiness.

The company already established its own proprietary AI infrastructure, Hive, designed specifically to meet nuclear's stringent regulatory and export-control frameworks. They also developed Bertha, a generative AI assistant that instantly accesses 75 years of meticulous nuclear knowledge and documentation at Westinghouse. Google engineers were impressed that a 140-year-old company had quietly assembled the exact foundation needed to deploy AI securely in a heavily regulated environment.

Building on data

The core AI innovation targets the construction process — historically 60% of reactor costs. Until recently, construction management relied on spreadsheets and paper documents, leading to delays that cascaded across thousands of interdependent tasks. But with AI, Westinghouse turned decades of documentation to its advantage.

The new AI system combines the companies’ AI models and prediction tools with Westinghouse’s WNEXUS, a 3D digital twin of its reactors. When combined with current and historic data, the system can predict bottlenecks, optimize construction task sequences, adjust staffing levels, and account for external factors like supply chain constraints.

AI as a ""technology brick""

The optimization technology for new reactor construction is built using a ""technology brick approach"" Martinez Sancho said, meaning it has applications far beyond the initial project. The same AI tools are already being applied to reduce licensing processes and operations timing. By finding the fastest path through maintenance and refueling tasks, the AI helps minimize reactor downtime.

Westinghouse views AI not as a tool for simple cost optimization, but instead as a catalyst for a revolution that transforms the energy sector and turns decades of documentation into an asset that accelerates progress.",https://info.westinghousenuclear.com/hubfs/Blog/Westinghouse-vogtle-plant-georgi.width-1000.format-webp.jpeg,N,,2025-11-25 12:02:22.833209

Your bill will barely drop,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/california-about-cut-power-company-profits-historic-lows-your-bill-will-barely-drop,"Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%.
PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million.
Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates.
Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.","With California electric rates stuck at nearly the highest in the nation, the state’s utility regulator is poised to lower the payout shareholders can receive from California’s three large investor-owned power companies.

In a proposed decision, the California Public Utilities Commission recommended dropping the “return on equity” by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. If approved, shareholders of all three companies would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. Such returns for PG&E and Edison haven’t dipped below double digits in at least 20 years.

Utilities said the decline would affect their ability to bring in needed investment for their work. Critics of the decision said that the decline is too small to meaningfully impact ratepayers’ bills, even if it’s a step in the right direction.

“California and other [public utility commissions] authorize rates of return that are far in excess of the statutory requirement,” said Mark Ellis, former chief economist at Sempra, which owns San Diego Gas & Electric.

The California Public Utility Commission is expected to vote on the decision in December.

Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A number of factors go into those rates, including wildfire mitigation costs. PG&E in particular has attracted the ire of California customers for its frequent rate hikes within the last year.

Baked into those bills is the return on equity, money meant to compensate shareholders for the risk of doing business. These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%. If approved, PG&E’s rate would be 9.93% (down from 10.28%), Edison would be 9.98% (down from 10.33%), and San Diego Gas & Electric would be 9.88% (down from 10.23%). These rates are not automatically guaranteed – utilities can fall short of this return if they don’t keep down costs, such as project overruns or unexpected lawsuit fees.

A small change in this rate can be a difference of millions of dollars for ratepayers. The return is a percentage of the rate base, the total value of a utility’s assets it can earn a return on; this includes projects such as building a new power plant, for example. The rate bases for California’s three large investor-owned utilities have steadily grown each year as they add new customers and projects, increasing the amount that shareholders can receive.

PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million. Had it been 1% lower, the potential return would have been $12.5 million less.

“The proposed cost of capital decision needs refinement to better reflect California’s unique risks and market realities,” said Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford. “Making those refinements in the final decision will enhance SCE’s ability to finance essential infrastructure projects for a more reliable, resilient and ready electric grid.”

PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison echoed this sentiment, saying the decision “fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems.”

Anthony Wagner, spokesperson at San Diego Gas & Electric, said, “A decision that accurately reflects these realities is essential to enabling investments that reduce wildfire risk, strengthen reliability, replace aging infrastructure and advance California’s clean energy transition for the benefit of the communities we serve.”

Utilities routinely request these rates be pushed higher because they are a key part of what goes into utilities’ credit rating, affecting the interest they pay on loans for infrastructure investments. But in recent years, experts and consumer advocates point to a mismatch – the utility industry is typically considered low-risk, but critics say the shareholder return rates don’t reflect that. Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates. And it’s costing utility ratepayers across the country as much as $7 billion annually, according to academics.

Ellis, the former Sempra economist, said there is a way to lower shareholder returns while keeping customer bills in check and maintaining credit ratings that the commission has not yet explored – changing the balance of debt and equity each utility has.

“You really need to understand credit,” he said. “This is where they’re going to get you.”

The commission is allowed to set the debt-equity balance when it determines shareholder returns, but it left this unchanged for all three utilities in its proposed decision for 2026. Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111023_angelica-vasquez_mo_cm_131764089140.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=Fna5JS1u,N,,2025-11-25 12:02:35.145444

The United States, which pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement at the start of the year, did not send a delegation. This no-show of the world’s second-largest carbon emitter was not the only disappointment. The meeting, which was held in Belém, Brazil, has done little to make progress, with the decisions made and the eight-page final document barely shifting the dial on slowing down climate change or averting its most dangerous effects.

Don’t scrap climate COPs, reform them

There were some positives. Delegates to this conference of the parties (COP) agreed on a substantial increase for ‘adaptation finance’, whereby high-income nations fund projects, ideally through grants, that protect low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from the effects of climate change. But although COP30 was dubbed the ‘implementation COP’, the core issue of phasing out fossil-fuel use did not make it into the final text. Even by the incremental standards of COP meetings, things have stood still.

In 2021, governments attending COP26 in Glasgow, UK, agreed to “phase down” the use of coal without carbon capture and to eliminate subsidies for fossil-fuel companies. They then adopted a goal of “transitioning away from fossil fuels” at COP28 in Dubai. But despite the efforts of a coalition of at least 80 countries from around the world, negotiators at COP30 failed to agree on even the idea that this transition needs a road map. This failure was mainly the result of opposition from oil-producing states, led by Saudi Arabia and including influential countries such as India and Russia — known collectively as the like-minded group.

Next year’s COP will be held in Antalya, Turkey, and will be jointly organized by the governments of Australia and Turkey. The two hosts and their allies have 12 months to inject some fresh thinking into a stalling process that risks consigning current and future generations to the perils and uncertainties of a warming planet. Fossil fuels must be phased out in a just and equitable way if the world is to prevent dangerous climate change. The challenge is how to bring the discussion on a road map back to COP31 and avoid a repeat of the outcome of COP30.

The ‘implementation COP’: why the Belém summit must ratchet up climate action

Although Brazil did not succeed this time — nor in agreeing a separate plan that sought to end deforestation — the country aims to continue informally discussing road maps for both goals with those nations that have supported developing such plans. This is positive and echoes a call made in these pages last month for the creation of informal spaces for policymakers and scientists to discuss contentious issues in UN negotiations (Nature 646, 1025–1026; 2025).

However, an agreement on how to end fossil-fuel use isn’t going to happen for as long as the current stand-off continues. Those countries objecting to even the idea of discussing a road map say that they cannot put their economies at risk. This is a legitimate concern, and any discussion on a road map must engage, in the necessary detail, with how to mitigate this.

However, national interests will not be served unless all countries can be persuaded to recognize the enormity of the bigger picture. That’s a core lesson from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and from accords in other domains that have succeeded against the odds, including this year’s agreement on a pandemic treaty. These have succeeded, at least in part, because countries rich and poor realized (or accepted) that if they did not act together, there would be risks for everyone — including themselves.

Navigating the black box of fair emissions targets

The transition to renewable energy is under way, especially in LMICs. But the development of clean energy is not going to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change while nations continue to burn fossil fuels at a high rate. This is widely accepted and backed by robust evidence. It also cannot be denied that, if climate change is allowed to continue at the current pace, no country will be immune to or safe from its effects. Yes, richer countries will initially cope better than poorer ones. But without coordinated global action, the effects of extreme weather will eventually harm all countries. It is not enough to say this just once or twice. It needs to be repeated again and again.

The legitimate concerns of states that rely on fossil-fuel exports need to be taken into account, and any formula for phasing out fossil fuels needs to be fair and equitable, especially to countries that are still on a path to industrialization. Those least able to afford the transition to clean energy must be supported by those that can. But, in the end, it is in everyone’s interests that all countries act to phase out fossil fuels. Efforts to block even a discussion on this have to stop.

For real climate action, empower women

COP30’s failure to acknowledge the need for a road map was a missed opportunity, but the fact that the talks did not blow up completely is a cause for hope, particularly at a time when multilateralism is under severe stress. It is also a sign that countries could yet recapture the spirit of Paris in 2015, when it seemed that the world had finally woken up to the dangers of global warming, and agreed the beginnings of a road map on how to restrict global temperature increases to within 2 °C of pre-industrial levels — and ideally 1.5 °C.

Thirty years after the first COP meeting took place in Berlin, and one decade on from Paris, that road map must be expanded to include a plan to phase out fossil fuels. Failure to do so will leave none of us unscathed.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03851-6/d41586-025-03851-6_51752038.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:02:17.220793

This isn’t the first time Trump has gutted the Endangered Species Act, or ESA.
What the new ESA rollbacks will mean The Endangered Species Act was, at its start, a bipartisan piece of legislation, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973.
It could significantly impact our ability to protect species from climate change, curb our ability to fight it, and even fuel it more.
But four out of five Americans support the current remit of the Endangered Species Act.","For more than 50 years, the Endangered Species Act has saved thousands of animals and plants from threats like poaching, habitat loss, and pollution. It brought bald eagles back from the brink of extinction, reestablished grizzly bear populations on public lands, and safeguarded the redwood forests that play host to dozens of vulnerable animals. In total, it has prevented the extinction of 99 percent of the species it has protected.

Last week, President Donald Trump announced that his administration is weakening or eliminating key provisions of the bedrock environmental law that protect vulnerable species from extractive activities like oil drilling.

This isn’t the first time Trump has gutted the Endangered Species Act, or ESA. Back in 2019, his administration changed the act to make it easier to remove a species from the list and to allow economic factors to be considered when determining whether to list a new species. Many of those changes were reversed during Joe Biden’s presidency, but may now be overturned once again. The new rollbacks were announced by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The proposed changes would also limit federal agencies’ ability to consider potential future impacts on a species — such as the impacts of climate change — when deciding which species to list. In addition, the so-called blanket rule, which bestows species listed as threatened with the same protections as those listed as endangered, would be canceled. (“Endangered” means a species is in danger of extinction, while “threatened” means it’s likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.)

“This is certainly of a piece with this administration’s drive to undermine conservation, undermine protection of federal lands and wildlife, and to benefit the extractive industries and stakeholders that certainly have this administration’s ear,” said Jane P. Davenport, a senior attorney at Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental nonprofit.

The ESA proposal came within days of two other major environmental rollbacks: The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to remove federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, scaling back the Clean Water Act and threatening drinking water for millions of Americans. The administration also said it would open nearly 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters to new oil and gas drilling.

What the new ESA rollbacks will mean

The Endangered Species Act was, at its start, a bipartisan piece of legislation, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973. At the time, many states had their own legislation in place, but those laws tended to be weak, Noah Greenwald, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said. Rules constrained by state borders didn’t reflect the natural spread or movement of species or the threats that impacted them, and they didn’t provide protections for habitats. The ESA addressed both of those concerns.

In 1982, Congress passed a set of amendments to the law that made it easier for non-federal land managers to develop endangered species’ habitat — even, in some cases, when those species might be “incidentally harmed.” Developers, loggers, and mining and drilling corporations have long pushed to create more workarounds, but have often been stymied by the idea of “critical habitat” — land that is protected by virtue of how necessary it is to a specific species.

The northern spotted owl, for instance, needs the complex forests of the Pacific Northwest in order to thrive. The rusty patch bumblebee needs places to nest underground in the Midwest and Northeast. “It’s not just enough to protect a species,” said Rebecca Riley, a managing director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “You also have to protect its habitat.”

What species to protect and how, as well as when to delist them, had previously been decided using only “the best scientific and commercial data available.” The Trump administration’s new policies will allow economic factors to now be part of the species listing process and habitat designation.

The climate implications of the proposed changes

The dismantling of the ESA would have ramifications for decades to come. It could significantly impact our ability to protect species from climate change, curb our ability to fight it, and even fuel it more. Forests being protected under the act soak up heaps of carbon dioxide in their tissues and transfer much of that carbon to fungi for storage in the soil. Wetlands, too, not only provide a safe place for species, but trap loads of carbon and, if they’re on the coast, act as buffers for hurricane storm surges and rising sea levels. Losing any of these habitats would mean a harder fight against planetary warming. Weakening the ESA will also open doors to more oil and gas drilling — adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. “It has double the effect,” Riley said. “You’re hurting the species and the ecosystem, and you’re harming the climate.”

When President Donald Trump attempted to weaken the Endangered Species Act during his first administration, he was up against stiff opposition: Environmental and climate groups sued the president, and Biden undid many of Trump’s changes in the first months of his presidency.

But 2025 is not 2019. In his second term, President Trump has pushed even harder to support expanded fossil fuel development, and critical minerals extraction is opening new avenues for mining, including on protected lands. The under-construction Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine in Thacker Pass, Nevada, for example, is to be built on the habitat of two organisms — Tiehm’s Buckwheat, a wildflower, and a rare snail called the Kings River pyrg, each of which is endemic to the area. (The wildflower is listed as endangered, the snail is not.) Environmental groups and tribes sued the Bureau of Land Management in an attempt to protect the Tiehm’s Buckwheat; those lawsuits cite the Endangered Species Act to provide legal backing.

“This administration is restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent, protecting species through clear, consistent, and lawful standards that also respect the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum in a statement.

But four out of five Americans support the current remit of the Endangered Species Act. “I think Americans understand that extinction is forever,” Riley said, “and they understand that we have a moral obligation to try to prevent species from going extinct.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2215762083s.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-25 13:01:21.895765

The silver lining in the loss of the federal tax credits could be increased scrutiny of such costs as the solar industry struggles to maintain momentum.
Dealer fees Dealer fees, sometimes called program fees, lending fees, finance fees, platform fees or original issue discounts, have for years been the dirty secret of the solar lending industry.
“We’re bringing the borrower, we’re underwriting the application, we’re signing the loan, we’re servicing the loan,” he said.
Paulen thinks that saving customers money by cutting out dealer fees could save the solar industry.","The holiday season could be a busy one for contractors and other installers of solar panels, battery storage and heat pumps.

Home and business owners are racing a December 31 deadline to complete such projects in order to be eligible for generous federal tax credits.

“We’ve actually had to recently hire on a new crew just to take the influx and demand,” Christian DeLuca of OHM Solar Solutions in Chico, Calif., told a local television station.

Many of the incentives for renewable energy and home upgrades were phased out under the Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill” legislation that President Trump signed in July. Sorry, the deadlines for electric vehicle tax credits have already passed.

Clean energy advocates are not throwing in the towel.

“We could cry. Or we could electrify,” the nonprofit Rewiring America says on its website, which includes a handy list of the expiring subsidies, as well as a tool to calculate potential savings.

The falling cost of photovoltaic panels, for example, can make residential solar systems a financial win for homeowners even without the federal subsidies (many states continue to offer their own incentives). In the US, the median installation cost per watt of residential solar panels, before incentives, fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.53 last year, according to EnergySage.

And the “soft” costs for solar systems could be cut further through streamlined permitting processes and direct-to-consumer loan products that eliminate the “dealer fees” that were often hidden in residential solar loan agreements. The silver lining in the loss of the federal tax credits could be increased scrutiny of such costs as the solar industry struggles to maintain momentum.

“The downside of the investment tax credit is there’s been extra fat available, and so that’s how these dealer fees have been able to survive so long, in such magnitudes,” said Bill Paulen, CEO of Seattle-based LoanTERRA, which launched last month to help credit unions and other lenders originate renewable energy loans, without dealer fees. “You’ve got that 30% tax credit that’s essentially eaten up by a dealer fee that can be 20%, 30% or more.”

“it’s hitting the taxpayer, and it’s hitting the borrowers and the consumers,” Paulen told ImpactAlpha.

Dealer fees

Dealer fees, sometimes called program fees, lending fees, finance fees, platform fees or original issue discounts, have for years been the dirty secret of the solar lending industry. Solar installers often have agreements with fintech lenders to offer point-of-sale financing to customers that want to avoid high upfront costs for solar systems and other upgrades.

The fees generally get added to the cash price of the system and rolled into the principal of the loan. That can make deceptive a seemingly low interest rate because the principal amount has been inflated by the hidden fee.

The Consumer Financial Protection Board, before it was itself gutted under the Trump administration, spotlighted harms to consumers from the fees. “Some lenders include substantial markups and fees that can increase the loan principal by 30% or more above the cash price,” the CFPB found. A $30,000 system with a $9,000 dealer fee, for example, would require a $39,000 loan.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison last year filed suit against four solar-lending companies for deceptive trade and lending practices and illegally high rates of interest. The lenders pocketed the fees, canceling out incentives for solar-panel purchases, Ellison said. “The lenders I sued today seriously misled consumers by promising cheap credit for solar installation, only to charge huge upfront fees that consumers didn’t know about.”

One of the companies, Solar Mosaic, filed for bankruptcy in June. Another of the companies, GoodLeap, told NPR that the fees are common in other areas, such as auto financing, and that the company complies with the Truth in Lending Act.

“It’s been a little lonely, being the voice standing on the mountain saying, ‘We’ve got this big problem in the industry of the dealer fees,’ and trying to get others to pay attention,” said LoanTERRA’s Paulen.

Customer demand

Paulen spent a decade developing solar loan products for credit unions, first as CEO of Generations Credit Union and then at Community 1st Credit Union. LoanTERRA is a platform to let any credit union, or other community lenders, make their own direct-to-consumer solar loans, cutting out the fintech middlemen and eliminating the dealer fees.

“This is too big of an opportunity, and there’s too much opportunity to clean up the financing in this industry,” Paulen told ImpactAlpha. LoanTERRA gets a 2% fee, paid by the lender, for bringing them the loan business, a standard practice in the industry.

“We’re bringing the borrower, we’re underwriting the application, we’re signing the loan, we’re servicing the loan,” he said. “We are able to contrast our products favorably to products that are already in the industry.”

That opens a new line of business for credit unions and community banks. Delinquency rates on residential solar loans average less than 1.5%, compared with 22% for credit cards. LoanTERRA’s first group of lenders is going through the due diligence process.

Paulen thinks that saving customers money by cutting out dealer fees could save the solar industry.

“Everyone’s expecting an anvil to fall on their head,” with the loss of the tax credits next year, he said. “If the public believes that solar has become 30% more expensive, it’s going to be harder for sales people to overcome that.”

The winners may be companies that can keep reducing solar prices, even without subsidies.

“No one really knows what’s going to happen in 2026,” Paulen said. “But even as the pie shrinks, we’re going to get a bigger slice of the pie because we’re the solution that makes it easier for people.”",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2359319045.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:01:52.002440

Everyone wants higher performance and more secure domestic supply chains.”

Perovskite-silicon tandem solar technology offers higher conversion efficiencies, meaning more power generation per panel compared with current industry-standard silicon cell technologies. But the material is very unstable and degrades at rates which have prevented any commercial adoption of the technology to date.

For its part, Swift Solar recently secured a contract with the US Department of Defence (recently rebranded the Department of War) to deploy perovskite tandem modules at a cyber warfare exercise in Virginia. This followed US$27 million in funding in June last year to support its technology development; the funding came from Eni Next, the corporate venture capital arm of Eni, Plenitude’s parent company.

Swift said it expects its modules to reach efficiencies of “28% or higher”, compared with the peak efficiencies of around 25% available in commercial modules today. In a public statement, the company said that with the expected surge in electricity demand from US data centres, “this efficiency advantage becomes increasingly valuable, enabling maximum power generation from limited land while reducing installation costs and improving project economics.”

Interest in perovskite tandem products is certainly high, and the technology seems to be getting closer and closer to meaningful commercial use. But challenges still present themselves, most notably the durability and stability issues with perovskite. More established technologies, like tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), which entered the mainstream of solar manufacturing last year, have made headlines in recent months as technical experts have unearthed issues with longevity and degradation at the cell level.

This creates risks for project returns and energy production which perovskite will have to overcome if it is going to take of at scale.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Plenitude_Texas.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:04:31.584121

First Solar has been producing solar technology in the United States since 2002 and remains the country’s leading photovoltaic manufacturer.","First Solar, Inc. has officially opened its new fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The company invested $1.1 billion in this project, which covers around 2.4 million square feet, making it nearly eleven times larger than the New Orleans Superdome. The factory currently employs more than 700 workers, and this number is expected to reach 826 by the end of the year. Once the facility reaches full production capacity, it will add 3.5 gigawatts of annual manufacturing output. With this addition, First Solar’s total U.S. manufacturing capacity is projected to reach 14 gigawatts in 2026 and expand to 17.7 gigawatts in 2027, once its newly announced South Carolina plant is fully operational.

The Iberia Parish facility began manufacturing solar modules in July 2025, several months earlier than planned. This faster schedule was made possible by strong policy support, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade measures, which boosted demand for solar technology made entirely in the United States and compliant with expected Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidelines. The facility is independent of Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains and uses American-produced materials such as glass from Illinois and Ohio, as well as steel from Mississippi that is fabricated into module backrails in Louisiana. It manufactures First Solar’s Series 7 modules.

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said that First Solar’s investment is already creating significant benefits for Iberia Parish by generating hundreds of well-paying jobs and increasing economic opportunities. He added that projects like this strengthen the state’s workforce and support the national goal of achieving American energy dominance. According to an economic impact analysis by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority, the new facility is expected to increase Iberia Parish’s GDP by 4.4 percent in its first full year of operation. Jobs at the plant offer an average total compensation of $90,000 per year, which is more than three times the current per capita income in the parish.

First Solar’s CEO Mark Widmar stated that the new plant reflects the company’s commitment to supporting American energy leadership, economic growth, and affordable electricity. He emphasized that manufacturing solar technology in the U.S. using American materials and talent demonstrates that large-scale reindustrialization is actively happening, not just being discussed.

The manufacturing facility is equipped with advanced technologies, especially artificial intelligence. AI-enabled systems, including computer vision and deep learning, help detect defects automatically during the production process. Workers use AI-driven tools to make operating decisions and improve efficiency. First Solar’s Chief Manufacturing Officer, Kuntal Kumar Verma, described the Louisiana plant as one of the most advanced solar factories in the world, adding that it shows how AI can enhance productivity and support American workers in reaching higher performance levels.

This new site is part of First Solar’s extensive manufacturing and research presence in the Western Hemisphere, which includes three fully integrated factories in Ohio, another in Alabama, and R&D centers in Ohio and California. Recently, the company also announced a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to bring additional Series 6 module processes back to the United States. By the end of 2026, First Solar expects to employ more than 5,500 people across the U.S. Since 2019, the company will have invested around $4.5 billion in manufacturing and research infrastructure nationwide.

First Solar has been producing solar technology in the United States since 2002 and remains the country’s leading photovoltaic manufacturer.

Sara Ivry: Hi everybody, I’m Sara Ivry, features editor at JSTOR Daily. About five years ago in Charleston, South Carolina, authorities announced plans to remove a public statue of John Calhoun. He was the seventh vice president of the United States and a defender of slavery. The news ignited passionate debates about public monuments and their role in society. Should public sculptures that cause offense be removed, or should they be left intact, so we’re reminded of our history even when that history is profoundly ugly?

These questions are part of a larger project that we’re undertaking at JSTOR Daily about public space and how it’s used. Our project includes this podcast series, which brings me to today’s guests. Jo and Joy Banner are twin sisters from Louisiana and the founders of The Descendants Project, which is anchored at Woodland Plantation about thirty miles from New Orleans on the banks of the Mississippi. You’ll hear more about that in a moment.

First, I want to welcome Jo and Joy to our podcast. Hello, and thanks for being here.

Jo Banner: Thank you for having us.

Joy Banner: Thank you.

I wonder, Joy, if you can start off by telling us a little bit about The Descendants Project. What are its origins?

Joy: Yeah, so The Descendants Project is a non-profit organization that my sister and I started about five years ago—can’t believe it’s already been five years. And we started The Descendants Project with the interest of protecting our Black descendant community, because we are in probably the most industrialized stretch of the Mississippi River, and our communities are getting wiped out by heavy industrial development. And so we wanted to protect our community. And Jo and I’s background is in tourism. And so, we are in a very heavily touristed spot as well. And most of the tourism is because of the plantations that we have around.

You won’t be surprised to hear that most of those plantations are one, not addressing the narrative of enslaved people, and, our tourist commissions and tourism bodies are not involving and including Black descendant communities and local community in the tourism economy, which we think is, you know, a good shift away from heavy industry, a much greener alternative economy and is one that actually centers the preservation of historic communities like ours. So, The Descendants Project, we sit sort of in this intersection of historic and community preservation along with environmental justice.

Ivry: And to be clear, descendants are descendants of the enslaved people who worked the plantations, is that correct?

Joy: Yes. So, along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans there were hundreds of plantations, and so communities like ours, who—it is not unique, me and Jo are tenth-generation Louisianians—and so, literally, we are we are still living in the spaces and places where plantations once existed, right? And so we are descended of people that were enslaved at the plantations that are as near as, you know, a couple hundred feet, in fact, from us.

Ivry: I want to talk more about The Descendants Project, but first I want to know a little bit more about the plantation itself, Woodland Plantation. Jo, maybe you can tell us a little bit about the history of this particular plantation and also its connection to you, if you grew up visiting it, what that was like for you, and so forth.

Jo: Woodland Plantation is located in Laplace, Louisiana, which is approximately twenty-five miles away from where we live. It was started around the 1700s, and [in] 1811 there was the German Coast uprising that occurred on a plantation site. So, this German Coast uprising was led by Charles Deslondes. Charles Deslondes went through numerous plantations along the river, throughout the river parishes of Louisiana, which is now known as Cancer Alley. He organized a revolt with about 500 people that participated in it. The intent was for the revolutionaries to gain their freedom, to march into New Orleans, whether it would either try to sell back to their homes, or they would capture the city and set it up as a free society. So, the culmination of that event happened on Woodland Plantation. And it’s believed to be one of the largest, or the largest, slave revolt that happened in this country. Despite that fact, however, many people are unaware of it, including the descendants who still live around the plantation home.

Ivry: I wonder if you can tell me what was your thinking in buying it, and what are your hopes for it? How does it fit into the larger puzzle of The Descendants Project?

Joy: So, the headquarters of The Descendants Project is actually not at Woodland, it’s in Wallace, at a separate plantation. And our community was being threatened by a massive industrial grain facility that would have wiped out our community. And in some type of mitigation to offset the damage that they would have done to not only us, but to Whitney Plantation, which is a slavery museum, they partnered with Woodland for $25,000. It had been operated as a museum for a couple of years, but it was not doing very well.

And so that was really the impetus of us understanding that when it comes to these plantation houses, it’s not strange for industry to come in and—they have to purchase them because they want the land—and then you have the big house that’s there, and then there’s some type of, again, like mitigation, public relations that happens where it’s like, “Look, we’re restoring a plantation.” You know, “We’re restoring this historic site.”

And so that was the company’s intention, was to really downplay the impact it would have on us by partnering with this plantation museum at the time. And that partnership did not work out, but it certainly signaled to Jo and I that if we did not step in to be the stewards of Woodland, that it was going to be used by industry to turn, like literally turn Black communities against each other, so that’s when we made the decision that we were going to seriously consider buying Woodland, and here we are.

Ivry: You mentioned Cancer Alley. Can you explain for listeners who may not have ever heard that phrase, what that refers to?

Jo: Cancer Alley is stretched between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that is heavy industry. It’s also been called Industrial Corridor because there are numerous plants, hundreds of plants, throughout the area. They’re all involved with pollution in one way… We have plastic pollution. We have oil and gas, we have grain, there is sugar refining, there’s aluminum, there’s steel. And because of our exposure to pollution, the residents in our area are at a higher risk of cancer. So, we have one of the highest risk of cancers in the country, we’re the 95th to 99th percentile, depending on where you’re located within Cancer Alley. So our community, St. John the Baptist Parish, is actually, like, we are in the exact middle of that stretch of, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. We have been on the United Nations. Oh, there’s been at least a couple of reports from United Nations, the situation that’s happening here in our community. So, it’s really like an international human rights crisis that’s happening right here in the United States.

Ivry: Of course, environmental degradation and pollution doesn’t observe any boundary, property lines or boundaries. It goes everywhere. It infiltrates all public space. I wonder how do you see the boundary between public and private, both in that case and in a more global sense?

Joy: So, I would like to correct that, because actually the science has proven for us that because of where these plants are sited—and they are sited around a predominantly Black community—that there is more polluted air based on race, right? And there are more health impacts, but you are right that in terms of the way that air works, these facilities and industries are not going to stop with our communities. And in Cancer Alley, just because we’re impacted more based on your community doesn’t mean that we don’t have white people that are getting cancer as a result of pollution. So yes, it’s an issue of private and public, but I think it’s more of an issue of the haves and the have nots. Right? Because even if people that are getting sick from the various diseases are going to have more access to the medical care that can alleviate their symptoms, that can still extend, you know, their life, can give them a better quality of life. And, like the way that the system is getting, as things get more and more expensive, and as there’s less and less restrictions on the permitting, I think that that space of, that cone of who’s getting impacted, is going to get larger and larger and larger. And I just hope that we can all, like, realize beforehand that they’re coming after the people that are most vulnerable.

Jo: Well, to your point, just recently, in the parish that’s neighboring us, St. Charles Parish, has been a public-private partnership between Shell and the community to create this whole park. So, this park is literally on the fence line of one of their refineries. It’s like a half-a-million-dollar investment has been put into this plant, and, “Wow, look how great it is, it’s new and shiny!” except literally the fence right there is just pollution billowing out of it. And there’s a constant hissing noise around it. So, all of this is happening as if there’s something we should be rejoicing about these public spaces. Like, do you realize how absolutely dangerous it is now? But yeah, it’s the shutting down of the senses, literally, to say, “Oh, wow, and let’s cut the ribbon at this public-private partnership!” The fact that we’re not noticing, or we ignore the danger, or many people are ignoring the danger. Some people just, they see it, but what can you do to stop it?

Joy: Well, and then the economic part of it, right? Like, how much money, and we say this as people who—our parents worked at Shell and Union Carbide, so we are children of industry. We are an industrial family. But that Shell emblem was everywhere. I mean, everywhere in our household, and Union Carbide, everywhere. But, like, Shell is getting how many hundreds of millions of dollars of tax incentives, right? And so now, that money that would have been used for infrastructure, that would have been used to build a park, Shell got excused from it. And then now, because they’re giving you a little bit money back of your own money, right? And now it’s like, “Let’s celebrate Shell for doing the good thing,” but it’s, like, but that’s way less than the money that you owe anyhow to actually address the harm. That’s the reason why you’re being taxed the way that you’re being taxed is to address the use and address the harm that you’re putting on a community, and, like, you get off with just building a park and then putting your logo on top of it.

Ivry: I wanted to ask you both, are you historians by training? What is your professional background? You mentioned being in tourism, but you’re definitely well versed in the environmental and history parts of this. So, tell me a little bit about your backgrounds.

Joy: Well, as I like to say, I’m a recovering business professor, business and marketing professor. My PhD is in communication studies—and I will say that that training in communication, especially now for this fight, is an excellent tool to have. I have never used it and appreciated it as much as I appreciated it now. And I think in terms of our background, we’re from an old community, and we had the benefit and pleasure of growing up around our elders, who were fantastic storytellers and who told about life on the river. And so it ended up making us enchanted by the history. And so I think we are just unrequited historians, but really being in a place where the focus was so much on industry and business, never saw a place for us career-wise in history, anthropology, and archaeology. And so the good part is now we’re getting to live all of that, you know, through The Descendants Project.

Jo: I would just say that, Joy expressed the humanities side of it, if you want to call it that, but also living in an environment where we have had our community almost taken away from us twice, from plastic production with PVC from Formosa to Greenfield Louisiana with grain, having that experience. Also being exposed to chemical leaks and going through explosions along the river or seeing our community treated differently because we were a Black descendant community versus a white community who’s pushing back against industry. That was a great teacher as well. So, we live in this intersection, we live in the middle of it all, and there’s no way we can shut out one without embracing or talking about the other.

So, like that plantation-to-pollution pipeline, we live right in the middle of it all. And because we are descendants, and we say we descend from the enslaved, but we descend from the river, and we descend from everything that happened along that river. All of that is in our blood. And that is also how I think it helps us and what we do in educating others and just also showing, “This is what it looks like in real life. This is what it looks like in the flesh and blood.” It’s not just, you know, a chapter in the history book, it is part of our lives, and it’s real.

Ivry: I can imagine you know, buying a place like Woodland and wanting to destroy it, you know, just as people wanted to take down the statue of Calhoun or something, that it represents something so toxic, why would you want to even leave it standing?

Joy: Well, I think for Jo and I, well, we understand, first of all, slavery is not something that just happened on plantations. Jo and I, we have worked as staff members, as tour guides, as administrators, you know, in all different positions, as directors at plantations. And people think that slavery happened here on this site, and just specifically. So, first of all, plantations, like, yes, is it ground zero? I call it ground zero. But the northern economy was also, you know, like, we forget that the north was like the first places where slavery is happening. You know, there are many people that are benefiting from slavery. You know, there are many buildings that have [been] built by the enslaved. So I don’t think that there’s any spot in the United States that hasn’t been touched by slavery and/or acts of racist violence against Black people. So that’s certainly one aspect of it.

Jo: What I think, too, is what I’ve noticed, is that what most people are angry about is not the fact that the plantations exist, because that is part of our history. You can knock down the building, but that wouldn’t change the fact that our ancestors were enslaved and that we’re still dealing with the ramifications of enslavement that are around us. What most people respond to I think negatively is the way the history is treated—or the erasure of that history. So, if we are going on a plantation, and it’s a Hollywood version of plantation life, that is the infuriating and frustrating part. So I mean, just from owning it, this was something, owning plantations—and something that I never expected—was how many people were, actually, Black people rejoiced in the fact that, “Wow, you all own a plantation, now we get to tell our story, now we can’t they can’t ignore it anymore,” because it symbolizes that the plantation is a part of our history, and they feel like we will honor—and we will—honor every part of that and respect it and give it the care that it deserves.

Joy: And I also think too, like, yes, a house is an inanimate object, but it’s made of organic material, and I believe that in our liberation, like, we’re liberating the house itself. You know, like that house, that wood never said it wanted to be used for the enslavement of people. Like those crops never said that they wanted to be used, you know, to cause such brutality and labor. And so I do feel like when we liberate ourselves, and it does feel like I’m releasing, you know, that house from that kind of violence. And then also to be used as an important resource, you know, I think it’s important education-wise and also as a center of healing. So, there’s so many uses that it can still be used for that I think we as a Black community still need, you know, for our healing.

Ivry: I wanted to ask you, Jo, you mentioned, like, the Hollywood version of plantation life, what do you mean by that? Can you explain a little bit more?

Jo: Yeah, I’m thinking of movies that glamorize plantations and the Civil War such as Gone with the Wind and, we will even see renditions of that in modern day, right? I’m surprised, I look back and Louisiana tourism had a commercial, and it featured the plantation on this tourism commercial, and it’s very, like, the person who was there was eating pecan pie, and it was like “Come visit sweet Louisiana!” So, it’s those images that are totally made up it shows this glamorous lifestyle of the plantation owner, of the sugar baron, and we see that often a lot because these plantations are our royalty. This is what royalty looks like in the United States or in North America. We still see it. I’m still surprised at how often I see that imagery. And that’s what is infuriating when someone can talk about, “Come and have a mint julep, and come dine here and imagine yourself in the footsteps of these people” without understanding that: But what was that built on? What about those who were enslaved? And also, even the lifestyle of a sugar baron wasn’t necessarily easy either. It was hard life, it could be very dirty life. But that part has been totally sanitized, has been totally erased in many instances, and that’s what people, I think, that’s what they respond to as a fact that this is totally not an accurate depiction of what plantations would have been and are.

Ivry: Where I live in New York City, you often see efforts, you know, to make spaces public, to take it away from private hands in order to make it accessible for everybody, or you have a private corporation that comes in and makes something accessible to everybody. In your case, it’s kind of like you flipped the script, and you’ve taken something into your own hands to make it more accessible to a population that wasn’t being served by the former owners of the site. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about that, about sort of, like, privatizing in order to publicize in a way.

Joy: Yeah, I think that’s, it’s a good point of showing how government can be so difficult for communities like ours that have been deemed sacrificial from the start. It touches back to being, our ancestors being sacrificed, coming from Africa, being put on these plantations, even when they were buried, there wasn’t really much concern. So, it’s just this lineage of not caring, of ignoring, of sacrificing our communities. So you have a government that’s very much doing what it’s been doing for, you know, all of these centuries, which has not been for our protection. So the only way that we can truly protect ourselves, until we can get a government that will truly honor the independence that it brags about every year and celebrates, we are the ones who have to take our own health into our hands, and our own happiness into our hands. So that is what liberation looks [like] for us: is being able to own that land and then find some way to then give it back to the public, until we can have a system that finally cares about us and [is] concerned about our survival and our existence.

Ivry: I think one of the really interesting things about this conversation is that it highlights that there are different publics and different communities. I mean, when we say public space, that’s so amorphous, and then when we start to sort of drill down, we’re like, oh, there’s different populations that are served. And it makes you really wonder what would be a completely public space in which everybody was equally represented and felt equally welcome. I don’t know what that would be, where that would be, and how it would look.

Jo: I think for, like your point about the statues, if you put a statue of Robert E. Lee in a park, or you name it after Robert E. Lee, and you say this for the public, how would your Black person… Is that space really for you? You’re saying, you’re signifying, this is not your space. Or yes, it’s your space, if you bow down to white supremacy, then yes is your space. So I think, right, just because we say public, what do we mean by public naming and placemaking is also a big part of that public space.

Joy: Yeah. And I think that the argument that, you know, like I’m hearing, like, “Oh, we can, why don’t we keep the statues up and just talk about the context of what it was in. Let’s talk about the racism!”

Really? We’re seeing that right now, right, where the intent of a statue is that it represents a value or an ideal that we as a public want to honor and uplift. That says, “Here is who we should be emulating!” Right? And then for us to take these quote unquote heroes to some and say, we’re going to leave it up there, but we’re going to talk about the fact that he owned 300 slaves. We’re going to talk about the fact that he raped women. You know, we’re going to talk about the fact that he sold children, and the organization that’s behind putting up, you know, this statue in the 1920s, like way after the Civil War, was actually a racist women’s group, you know, from the South. So, really, are you telling me that people are going to be okay with putting all that context in with the statues? Probably not.

Jo: And even if you did, if I’m just going to a park, do I really want to hear all of that? I just want to go to a picnic with my family. Really, do I need to know all about, okay, Robert E. Lee. No.

Joy: The trauma.

Jo: Right, the trauma. And okay, go and enjoy your hamburger, you know. And so, it’s just, like, come on, right?

Joy: That’s a really good point.

Jo: Oh gosh, yes.

Ivry: You know, as I understand it, you want Woodland ultimately to be a site of education. And I wonder what do you imagine that looks like? And then also for whom?

Joy: So, when we say that Woodland is a site of education, there is still a descendant community specific to Woodland that is still near it, it’s called Woodland Quarters. And so first of all, as an organization called The Descendants Project, our first responsibility is to the descendant community. And so what we would hope is that for them and the larger, you know, Black community, and the larger community in general, to think of that space as a place of education but also heritage, and arts, and a resource that assists, you know, their pursuit of quality of life, right? Something that adds something to their population and that’s in service of them.

But in terms of the education… Parts of it, we want to deal with slavery in a way that… We have a lot of organizations that are doing a great job, I named one, Whitney Plantation. But it’s like, how can we build on this education about slavery that’s also not being taught.

Right now, we have a temporary executive director who has a background in, like, the impact of trauma to the body, right? So as we are setting up Woodland as this interpretive space, like, we are looking at what has been the impact of trauma on Black bodies, not only because of racism and because of issues, but like literally when they are walking through a space, like Jo just mentioned, like sure we can add all of this context to a statue, but then as a Black person, does that make it better that I have to see Robert E. Lee and all of the pain that he caused, you know, while I’m trying to have peace and relaxation, you know, with my family? So, we want to address all of those issues.

Jo: And I’ll also add to, like, for education, much of it is about building, but also, it’s about deconstructing and allowing expression. Because what we don’t want is for, especially Black people, to walk into that space and feel that they can’t express themselves because they’re so used to how the tour has been constructed through, like, other sites that they may have visited.

We will find that, as our programming is touching more to like Black community, we may find a need, for example, where we may sing and we may dance, and it may be on a porch of a plantation, but you know what, it fits in because of this is something that we as Black people do. So, like, we’re seeing like all these different threads and through lines and all this engagement now that honestly I hadn’t even thought about it until it happens. And we’re, like, okay right now there is, we have a DJ that’s playing on a porch for a Black commemoration event, and he’s playing music that you hear at a Black family reunion. The Black people are going to dance, are going to want to feel that need to dance. So, how’s it all coming together? I think ultimately what it means, like this is what liberation feels like, and this is what happens when Black people can freely express themselves on sites like Woodland.

Ivry: Given all the obstacles that this project faces, given the environmental degradation of the area, how do you yourselves keep going every day? I mean, it’s got to be very emotionally taxing.

Joy: You know, I would say that there is a movement called “Living with the Trouble.” You know, like, even when you are in places of devastation, in some respects, it doesn’t mean that you aren’t in places of absolute beauty. Like, I’m looking at my window right now, and it’s green, and there’s a bird sitting out on my ledge. My parents are right next door. I’m able to work in an organization that Jo and I created literally from the dreams that we had, from our passions. I get to work with my twin sister. And so, it’s like, along these obstacles, it’s not like good stuff isn’t happening, right? And, you know, and I think that there is an art form, and there is a satisfaction that comes with tackling problems. And like, we’re winning some, too; like, we’re winning a lot. And so I think that this idea of, like, because things aren’t absolutely perfect that we give it all up and stuff… That’s not life. That’s not anybody’s reality. Every aspect has its challenges. And so I feel especially grateful and blessed to be anointed and chosen to do this kind of work.

Jo: Yeah, I’ll just add that we don’t have the luxury of giving up. We don’t have the luxury of saying, “How do I keep going?” You just keep going. And so that’s what we do, and I think, like Joy said, there is a lot of beauty around us. This area is… it’s breathtaking. In the bad ways, but also in the good ways, too. It’s life giving, and it’s the roots. I can’t walk out of my door without tripping on a root. So, literally of my roots, and that makes me so connected to the land and understanding the spirituality and the energy that’s here.

And that’s what keeps me going. And you know, it’s fun pissing off billionaires. I have to say, that gives me a lot of joy in the world. When they think they can take you out, right, and they can tell you what to do. And you can push back just on your stubbornness, and you win? Right? That is very life-giving, too.

Joy: We’ve had some fun. We’ve had some fun.

Jo: Like we mean, when we say we are going to fight morning, noon, and night? I mean, we have fought morning, noon, and night. We don’t stop fighting. And so, and that’s what gives us our advantage, is because we have something that we truly love and we’re passionate for.

You know, our, the symbol of our, of The Descendants Project is a Fawohodie, an adinkra symbol, meaning, it’s a symbol of emancipation. But what it really means is: emancipation comes with its responsibilities. And, like, we understand the work that is involved in being stewards of this land, and we’ve, not only did we sign up for it, we created an organization to do just that. And so we just have to, like, again, this is our purpose in life. And we are extremely happy to do the work.

the only thing that I wanted to add, as you talked about, again, at the public and private space, that now we are seeing our public spaces attacked for the stories that they’re telling and the truth that they are telling. And it is going to be the responsibility of private organizations, like The Descendants Project and other private museums, that is going to have to step up. We’ve been doing that work, but I think there’s going to be an even larger responsibility, you know, those of us that are not getting as much funding from the federal government, which we are not, thankfully. It will be up to us to carry that mission. So donating and funding organizations like ours is going to be, you know, extremely important.

Basic EB-2 NIW Requirements for Wind Energy Engineers

Before diving into strategy, understand foundational EB-2 NIW requirements for wind energy engineers.To qualify as engineer for EB-2 NIW, must satisfy two categories of requirements: Advanced Degree like master's degree or higher in engineering field or foreign equivalent, and Exceptional Ability demonstrated by degree of expertise significantly above norm Kameli Law.

For most wind energy engineers, the advanced degree path works smoothly. You need a master's or higher in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, or related fields with wind energy focus. Bachelor's degree plus five years progressive experience in wind energy also qualifies.Provide evidence of a US degree above bachelor's or foreign equivalent degree, or evidence of US bachelor's degree or foreign equivalent followed by 5 years progressive experience in specialty USCIS. Wind energy system design, turbine engineering, or renewable energy integration all qualify as specialty areas.Foreign degrees work fine as long as they're equivalent to US advanced degrees. Get credential evaluation if needed to establish equivalence clearly for immigration purposes.

The exceptional ability route requires meeting at least three criteria. Official academic records showing exceptional performance. Professional engineering license. Evidence of ten years full-time experience in wind energy. Salary demonstrating exceptional ability compared to peers. Membership in professional associations like American Wind Energy Association. Recognition for achievements through industry awards or patents.Most wind energy engineers qualify through advanced degrees combined with technical achievements rather than exceptional ability alone.

The Three Prong Dhanasar Test for Wind Engineers

Every EB-2 NIW for engineers must prove three specific prongs from Matter of Dhanasar.

Prong One: Substantial Merit and National Importance

Your proposed endeavor must have intrinsic value and broad national impact, which for engineers could mean working on national infrastructure, advancing technology supporting national security, contributing to clean energy innovation, or delivering automation solutions boosting economy Kameli Law.Offshore wind development demonstrates clear national importance. Build policy-ready narrative aligning work with US priorities like CHIPS Act or National AI Strategy Amir Ismail And Associates. Federal offshore wind targets of 30 gigawatts by 2030 validate priority status.

The funding will support Constellation Energy Generation, LLC in financing the Crane Clean Energy Center, an 835 MW facility located on the Susquehanna River in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania. This loan marks a major step toward restoring reliable, carbon-free power to the region.

Energy Secretary Wright highlighted further,

“Thanks to President Trump’s bold leadership and the Working Families Tax Cut, the United States is taking unprecedented steps to lower energy costs and bring about the next American nuclear renaissance. Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region. It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) is the first company to receive a simultaneous conditional loan commitment and financial close from the DOE Loan Programs Office. Its strong finances and credit rating allowed the process to move quickly. The loan, provided through the Energy Dominance Financing Program, will lower financing costs and attract private investment to restart the plant. In addition, DOE noted the project will help the U.S. stay competitive in the global AI and digital economy, which is driving higher electricity demand.

Crane Clean Energy Center: Returning 835 MW of Carbon-Free Power

The Crane Clean Energy Center is an 835-megawatt nuclear plant on the Susquehanna River. Previously known as Three Mile Island Unit 1, it has a long and historic legacy. In March 1979, Three Mile Island Unit 2 suffered a partial meltdown and has remained in monitored storage ever since. Unit 1, however, continued operating safely for four decades before being shut down in September 2019 due to market conditions rather than safety concerns.

In September 2024, Constellation signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which allows the tech giant to buy the carbon-free electricity generated by the restarted plant. Following the agreement, Constellation rebranded the facility as the Crane Clean Energy Center. As said before, once operational, the plant will provide 835 MW of nuclear energy.

DOE Loan Accelerates the Restart

Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) is the first company to receive a simultaneous conditional loan commitment and financial close from the DOE Loan Programs Office. Its strong finances and credit rating allowed the process to move quickly. The loan, provided through the Energy Dominance Financing Program, will lower financing costs and attract private investment to restart the plant. In addition, DOE noted the project will help the U.S. stay competitive in the global AI and digital economy, which is driving higher electricity demand.

DOE stated that the Crane loan aligns with President Trump’s Executive Order on Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base. The project is the first under this administration to receive a simultaneous conditional commitment and financial close.

Because the reactor was never fully decommissioned, restarting it is faster and more cost-effective than building a new plant. The loan will fund equipment inspections, system upgrades, workforce training, and regulatory compliance. Once approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the plant will supply enough electricity to power about 800,000 homes across the PJM Interconnection region. It will help lower electricity costs, strengthen grid reliability, and create hundreds of jobs.

Pennsylvania Leads in Clean Energy and AI Power

Senator Dave McCormick praised the DOE loan, saying Pennsylvania is leading the nation in energy independence and AI innovation. He highlighted that the restart will deliver more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity and create 3,400 direct and indirect jobs.

McCormick also noted Constellation’s ongoing investments across the state, including commitments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit. The restart comes amid unprecedented electricity demand from AI, cloud computing, and expanding data centers.

A Goldman Sachs report predicts that AI could increase data-center power demand by 160 percent. AI queries, like those used by tools such as ChatGPT, require nearly ten times more electricity than a standard Google search. Nuclear power is vital to meet this growing demand reliably.

Extending Nuclear Plant Life: Constellation’s Strategy for Reliable Power

Constellation has invested in local communities by committing over $1 million in charitable contributions over five years. In 2025 alone, the company donated $200,000 to support nonprofits, workforce programs, and local initiatives.

Significantly, restarting Crane is part of Constellation’s larger multi-billion-dollar plan to extend the life of America’s nuclear fleet, increase output, and ensure reliable power for decades.

The Crane Clean Energy Center is expected to deliver significant economic benefits to Pennsylvania. An analysis by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council projected that the restart would create thousands of direct and indirect jobs. It could add more than $16 billion to the state’s GDP and generate over $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

The plant is already more than 80 percent staffed, with over 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics, technicians, and licensed operators. Regulatory reviews and technical inspections remain on schedule.

Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, said:

“DOE’s quick action and leadership is another huge step towards bringing hundreds of megawatts of reliable nuclear power onto the grid at this critical moment. Under the Trump administration, the FERC and DOE have made it possible for us to vastly expedite this restart without compromising quality or safety. It’s a great example of how America first energy policies create jobs, growth and opportunities and make the grid more reliable. Utilities and grid operators are moving too slowly and need to make regulatory changes that will allow our nation to unlock its abundant energy potential. Constellation and nuclear energy are helping to lead the way and we are thankful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for putting the ‘energy’ back into DOE.”

Nuclear Power for America’s Clean Energy Future

The surge in AI, electrification, and cloud computing has made nuclear energy more critical than ever. Small modular reactors and advanced technologies are gaining interest from utilities and data-center developers.

The U.S. produces about 30 percent of the world’s nuclear electricity. Ninety-four reactors supply steady, clean power to millions of homes and industries nationwide. According to the World Nuclear Association, U.S. reactors generated 779 terawatt-hours in 2023, accounting for 19 percent of the nation’s total electricity output.

The administration aims to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050. The International Energy Agency projects 35 GW of new capacity by 2035 and 200 GW by 2050, nearly triple current levels. Restarting Crane contributes to this goal while providing reliable baseload power, supporting AI and digital growth, and boosting the economy.

“And so your local grocery store, believe it or not, is still transporting that from California.","The pollution from food is sneaky. Because the apple sitting on your kitchen counter isn't really causing any harm.

But chances are good that you didn't pick it from a tree in your backyard. It required land and water to grow, machines to harvest and process, packaging to ship, trucks to transport and often refrigerators to store. Much of that process releases planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

That's why the global food system makes up roughly a third of worldwide, human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EDGAR FOOD pollution database.

Meanwhile, roughly a third of the U.S. food supply is lost or wasted without being eaten, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It might never get harvested, it might spoil in transit or the grocery store might reject it for being the wrong size or color. That's a big reason why some consumers are looking for less-wasteful alternatives ranging from farmers markets to delivery services for produce that didn't meet supermarket size or appearance standards.

“There’s a whole breadth of opportunities to purchase food,” said Julia Van Soelen Kim, food systems adviser with the University of California Cooperative Extension.

And during the week of Thanksgiving, this decision is especially high stakes because lots of grocery shoppers are buying for extra guests, and more food can mean a bigger climate impact.

Here are tips for reducing impact by shopping beyond the grocery store.

The community supported agriculture box

Jane Kolodinsky, professor emerita at the University of Vermont and director of research at Arrowleaf Consulting, has bought her produce directly from a local farmer for 30 years.

It’s called Community Supported Agriculture, or CSA. At the beginning of every harvest season, Kolodinsky pays that farm a fee. Then, once per week, she picks up a box of produce at the farm. Some CSA programs pick the produce, while others let you customize. Some deliver. An online database shows which farms participate in CSA programs.

Since the food is grown nearby, there is less processing and packaging. “There's a smaller carbon footprint for purchasing locally compared to global or national food distribution channels,” said Van Soelen Kim. “When they’re local, they’re traveling less distance, so less gas, less fuel.”

Local farmers are also likely to grow whatever works best for the area's climate and season. “When things are in season, they need less storage time, so less electricity for cold storage,” said Van Soelen Kim, who added that can also mean a smaller food bill.

It’s not pollution-free, because the crops still require land and water, and the food does travel some distance. But CSAs avoid many steps in the modern food supply chain.

That model is challenging for consumers who want to maintain the same shopping list year-round. Shopping in-season requires more flexibility. “I would encourage consumers to think, ’OK, year-round we want some hand fruit that’s firm,'” she said. “So maybe it’s apples, and then it’s pears, and then its gonna move to kiwis, and then is gonna move to pluots.”

And in colder regions, she said there is still local produce. It's just more likely to be dried, frozen or canned.

The farmers market

Kolodinsky said the oldest alternative food system is the farmers market, where vendors gather and sell directly to consumers. Growers also sell at farm stands that aren’t tied to a centralized, scheduled event.

Farmers markets allow consumers more flexibility to pick the produce than a typical CSA. They also offer seasonal produce and less packaging and processing than a grocery store. Many also accept payment associated with government food assistance programs.

Plus, these models cut down on waste because customers are more tolerant of produce that's not a uniform size and shape, said Timothy Woods, a University of Kentucky agribusiness professor.

“It doesn’t matter to me if one cucumber’s a couple inches longer than the other one,” he said. “Less waste means more efficient utilization of all the resources that farmers are putting out to produce that crop in the first place.""

Other delivery services

Farmers who sell to grocery stores typically have to meet high standards, Woods said. For example, there could be onions that never got big enough or the carrot that grew two roots — vegetables that are just as safe and tasty to eat. There's also surplus harvest.

“They will intentionally not pick certain melons that are undersized out in the field. And so you’ll have gleaning programs that will be people that are saying, ‘Those are perfectly good cantaloupe that are out there. We’ll send a team out there to pick those,’” said Woods.

He said services delivering food that doesn’t meet supermarket size or appearance requirements, such as Misfit Markets or Imperfect Produce, have become more popular in recent years.

Van Soelen Kim said there isn't a lot of data yet on whether these services have a significantly lower climate impact. They reduce food waste, but the food might come from far away.

Misfits Market refreshes its online selection weekly. Customers then fill a box of often discounted groceries that might have misprinted labels or are undersized or blemished. They are delivered via a company truck or third-party courier such as FedEx. The company's founder and CEO, Abhi Ramesh, said it minimizes emissions by having set delivery days instead of offering on-demand delivery.

“By doing that, we batch all of our deliveries together. So it is one van to your ZIP code on that day. One truck that goes from our warehouse on that date,” he said.

Ramesh said sometimes a farmer's market or CSA is even better at offering nearby seasonal food than his company. But for a lot of the country, those services go away when the harvest season ends. “And so your local grocery store, believe it or not, is still transporting that from California. But the difference is we’re able to go and transport the food waste piece, which reduces a ton of emissions.”

Woods' advice for using services like Misfits Market is the same as other channels: Eat seasonally, eat locally and look for minimal packaging.

After nearly a year since the environmental disaster caused by Enterprise Products, LLC from a failure of its pipeline, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe extends its appreciation to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its increased authority over the remediation and waste management at the site.

The pipeline failure occurred in December 2024 has resulted in Colorado’s largest spill of its kind — an estimated 97,000 gallons of refined gasoline.

The EPA announced last week that it will fulfill its statutory responsibility and federal trust responsibilities and work with CDPHE to implement the State’s Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The Tribe, EPA, and CDPHE are jointly responding to the spill. On November 4, 2025, the Tribe expressed significant concerns with hazardous waste management, treatment, and storage related to the Enterprise remediation site to the EPA. In response to Tribal concerns, the EPA will ensure that the cleanup is performed in accordance with federal requirements and will also monitor Enterprise’s hazardous waste generator requirements, better known as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) compliance.

Enterprise previously submitted a Treatment-by-Rule Request to CDPHE to treat hazardous waste associated with the remediation on-site. On-site hazardous waste treatment can be done in a safe and responsible manner, but there have been issues of non-compliance with applicable hazardous waste laws. The Tribe has been actively monitoring the situation and expressed concern with the request given the non-compliance.

The EPA has issued a notice of non-compliance to Enterprise regarding violations and safety concerns at the site, including hazardous waste characterization, storage and disposal. With hazardous waste stored near Reservation residents and the Animas River, continued delay puts people and the environment at unnecessary risk. The EPA, the Tribe, and CDPHE will conduct a joint inspection on December 2, 2025, to confirm if these issues have been rectified.

Although the spill occurred on fee lands within the Reservation boundary, the Tribe’s Environmental Programs Department (EPD) recognized the threat to Tribal members and the public from the onset and has been fully involved in oversight decisions with EPA, CDPHE, and Enterprise. EPD, along with support from the Tribe’s Department of Energy, attends weekly update meetings, technical discussions, comments on remedial documents submitted by Enterprise and conducts independent technical assessments to gauge the cleanup progress.

EPD’s dedication to ensuring the utmost accountability and visibility from the responsible party is part of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe’s commitment to the protection of our people, water and environment.

Although natural gas generation still provides more electricity than any other source in California, electricity generation from natural gas has decreased over the past several years while generation from solar has increased.

According to data from our Electric Power Monthly, electricity generation from January through August 2025 (the latest data in our October release) was 140.9 billion kilowatthours (BkWh), 8% more than the same period in 2020.

The generation growth in recent years has been driven by solar. Solar generation by utility-scale power plants in California totaled 40.3 BkWh in the first eight months of 2025, nearly double the 22.0 BkWh over the same period in 2020. In the first eight months of 2025, solar generation increased 17%, or 5.9 BkWh, compared with the same time period in 2024.

Between January and August 2025, natural gas supplied 45.5 BkWh of electricity, 18% less than during the same period in 2020. Output increased in 2021 due to drought-spurred reduced hydroelectric output, but natural gas generation has fallen since then. The largest year-over-year drop occurred this year, when natural gas generation declined 9.5 BkWh, or 17%, compared with 2024.

In low-water years, the need for natural gas generation can increase. For example, hydro output fell in the first eight months of 2021 to 10.3 BkWh, and natural gas generation spiked to 63.5 BkWh.

Natural gas generation decreases during the middle of the day when solar generation is highest. During the midday hours (between noon and 5:00 p.m.) in May and June, which have similar cooling requirements, solar generation increased from 10.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2020 to 18.8 GW in 2025, according to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). CAISO changed its data collection methodology for natural gas in December 2023, and data posted prior to that are not comparable.

During peak evening hours between 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., generation from batteries charged by excess solar generation during midday rose from an average of less than 1 GW in May and June 2022 to 4.9 GW in 2025, displacing natural gas generation during that period.

Operations are anticipated to increase in 2026, contingent upon final agreements and successful implementation.

Moreover, NeoVolta claims the funding secured through this financing significantly strengthens its financial standing, improving liquidity and meeting working capital requirements to support ongoing growth efforts.

The plant’s establishment in Georgia is perhaps also notable. Utility Georgia Power predicts over 8GW of load growth in its service area by 2030, updating the assumptions from 2023 when it submitted the initial draft of its integrated resource plan (IRP). At that time, it predicted around 6GW of load growth by the end of this decade.

In a guest blog for Energy-Storage.news, Allan Oduor from Enertis Applus+ pointed out that current and future load growth is driving Georgia’s increasing number of utility-scale storage projects. He also noted that the state is becoming a key player in the domestic battery supply chain.

NeoVolta and IGC also intend to create a shared framework to assess potential future commercial opportunities, including offtake arrangements that could align NeoVolta’s commercial channels with IGC’s grid-scale pipeline, pending definitive agreements.

In NeoVolta’s Q4 2025 revenue update, the company delivered US$4.8 million, noting that this more than doubled Q3 2025’s fiscal revenue report.

The company also reported a net loss of US$5 million, compared to US$2.3 million in 2024.

They will stay a net-positive country, probably, and then others would have to go net negative.","But fanfare over the electric future was decidedly tamped down. The atmosphere reflected the uneasy state of EVs in America in this first year of the new Trump administration. During Kia’s press conference to start the day, for example, the EV9 three-row electric crossover lingered at the edge of the stage while brand bigwigs revealed a redesign of its petroleum-powered cousin, the best-selling Telluride, whose climate credentials go only as far as a 30-miles-per-gallon hybrid version.

Hyundai has been perhaps the most successful brand outside of Tesla in selling America on EVs, but its L.A. presentation pushed battery power into niche corners of the car world, the racetrack and the trail. One of its two attractions was the North American reveal of the limited-edition Ioniq 6N, the powered-up sports car version of the Ioniq 6 electric sedan, which the brand revealed at this very show three years ago.

This 641-horsepower battery-powered beast was an inevitability, given that Hyundai’s high-performance “N” division has built limited-edition racing versions of many of the carmakers’ stock vehicles, and its muscular version of the Ioniq 5 hatchback has been one of the best-regarded performance-focused EVs yet to hit the car market. Like its predecessor, Ioniq 6N is a test case in how to make electric power appeal to car enthusiasts who crave stick shifts and snarling V8s, so Hyundai built in simulated gear shifts and sounds to simulate the sensations of pushing a combustion car to its limits.

More compelling — and curious — was the Crater, the kind of otherworldly angular tank that Tesla’s Cybertruck wishes it were. A concept car rather than a vehicle ready to go into real production, the Crater is meant to signify the vision of Hyundai’s XRT sub-brand that makes off-roading versions of the brand’s vehicles, combustion ones included.

Although Hyundai barely said the “e” word during its presentation, Crater is meant to at least suggest an all-electric version of a supremely rugged vehicle that would compete with the likes of the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco. The concept has no tailpipe or engine, and the pixelated lights are taken from those used on the Ioniq series. Yet even this is uncertain: Having been burned by the back-and-forth of regime change in America, with Biden-era EV incentives disappearing just as the Korean brands were adjusting their production lines to meet the rules, the carmakers are wondering how hard to push battery power here.

Even the all-electric car brands didn’t arrive with sound and fury to show off all-new cars that would invigorate the EV market. Instead, they are doing the slow and steady work that legacy car companies have been doing for years, hoping to build long-term stability by filling out their vehicle lineups with more subtly different versions at more price points.

The Rivian R2 sat at the edge of the brand’s small display, giving many people their first in-person look at what could be the make-or-break vehicle for the EV startup. Its quiet presence was a subtle reminder that the smaller SUV is coming next year at a promised price of around $45,000, which would provide a (more) affordable option for drivers who’ve lusted after the brand’s $70,000-plus initial slate of electric SUVs and pickup trucks.

Likewise, Lucid took the mic after Hyundai to introduce a somewhat more attainable version of its electric SUV. The Gravity Touring edition brings the vehicle’s starting price from six figures down to $80,000, thanks in part to a smaller battery pack that still delivers more than 300 miles of range thanks to the carmaker’s hyper-focus on aerodynamics and efficiency. The price is still high, but this is a compelling vehicle: Gravity is a spacious three-row vehicle that goes 0 to 60 miles per hour in four seconds and recharges its battery at blazing speed thanks to 1,000-volt architecture that can add a claimed 200 miles in 15 minutes.

Car show stories come with a big caveat: These events don’t have the status they did in the heyday of old media, when new vehicles greeted the world for the first time in front of the assembled reporters. Tesla has always hosted its own vehicle events rather than share the stage, and these days, lots of brands have followed suit. Rivan revealed the R2 and R3 on its own turn last year, which is why the R2 could loom, unheralded, in a quiet corner of the show floor in Los Angeles.

Yet what the car industry chooses to show and say in front of the car media is still a telling indicator. What the companies said and didn’t say on Thursday suggests an industry that’s clearly struggling to navigate the electrification transition in America. Kia has been at the forefront of building great EVs for the States; its trumpeting of a hybrid Telluride is welcome, but 10 years out of date. The absence of EV hype in press events reveals an industry putting the brakes on the big talking points and preparing to lean back toward fossil fuels to maintain their profitability through this era of American EV limbo.

The idea demands a far meatier discussion than world leaders have had to date, according to Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, and a key contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scientific reports. If limiting warming to 1.5 degrees now requires surpassing that level and coming back to it later, and if this is something that countries actually want to attempt, there are a lot of implications to think through.

Geden and Andy Reisinger, an associate professor at Australian National University and another IPCC author, published an article last week spelling out what it would mean for policymakers to take this concept of “temporary overshoot” seriously. For example, the final agreement from COP30 encourages Parties to align their nationally determined contributions towards global net zero by or around mid-century.” Net zero, in this case, means cutting CO2 emissions as far as possible, and then cancelling out any residuals with efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Scientists now estimate that if the world achieves that balance by 2050, we’ll pass 1.5 and bring warming to a peak of about 1.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels. At that point, the planet will not begin to cool on its own. Ensuring that an “overshoot” of 1.5 degrees is temporary, then, requires removing even more carbon from the atmosphere than is being emitted — it requires achieving “net-negative” emissions.

Suffice it to say, you will not find the words “net negative” in any COP agreements. “If 1.5 degrees C is to remain the core temperature goal, then net zero can no longer be seen as an end point but only as a transition point in climate policy,” Geden and Reisinger wrote. The two stress that this wouldn’t prevent all of the harms of going past that level of warming, but it would reduce risk, depending on the magnitude and duration of the overshoot.

I spoke to Geden on Thursday, while the UN climate conference was still underway in Belém, Brazil, about what policymakers are missing about overshoot and the 1.5 degree goal. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

I’ve had scientists tell me they don’t like the term “overshoot” because the 1.5 degree boundary is arbitrary. How do you think about it?

You can apply the concept of overshoot to any level. You could also apply it to 2 degrees or 1.6 or 1.7. It’s just saying that there is a defined level you care about, and it’s about exceeding that level and returning to it later. That is the basic concept, and then 1.5 is the logical application right now in terms of where climate policy is. That return idea is not very well represented, but that’s how it has been used in the IPCC for quite some time — exceedance and return.

What was the impetus for writing the article with Reisinger and what was your main message?

We wanted to explain the concept of overshoot because it seems that it’s now being discussed more. The UN secretary general started using it in a speech to the World Meteorological Association two weeks before Belém, and now has continuously done so. It also led to some irritation because people interpret it as, He just called 1.5 off, although he usually says, “Science tells us you can come back to it.”

These overshoot trajectories and pathways for 1.5 degrees have been around since at least the Special Report on 1.5 Degrees in 2018, and then increasingly dominated the modeling of 1.5. But we feel that the broader climate policy community never quite got the point that it is baked into these trajectories whenever scientists say 1.5 is still possible. But then this element of, what does this now mean? Who has to do what? How is it possible to get temperature down? That’s even more obscure, in a way, in the political debate, because it means net-zero CO2 is not enough. Net-zero CO2 would halt temperature increase. To get it down, you need to go net negative. And then the obvious question, politically, would be, who’s going to do that?

In the paper, you write that the amount of net-negative emissions required to reduce global average temperatures by just 0.1 degrees is about equal to five years of current annual emissions, or 100x our current annual carbon removal, which is mostly from planting trees. Given that, is it realistic to talk about reversing warming?

That’s not for me to say. If you think about the trajectory — how would, let’s say, a temperature trajectory in the 21st century look? What you would get now is a peak warming level above 1.5. Then really the question is, what happens afterwards? If everybody only talks about going to net-zero CO2 then we should assume it’s that new peak temperature level, and then we just stay there. But if you want to say the world needs to go back down to 1.5 by the end of the century then we have to talk about net-negative levels, and we still may find out that it’s not realistic.

This kind of circumvents the conversation of how good we look on getting to net zero. We all assume that’s doable. I also assume that’s doable. But you cannot forget the fact that right now, our emissions are still rising.

One of the policy implications you write about in the piece is that if Europe were to set a target to go net negative, its carbon pricing scheme could go from a source of income to a financial burden. Can you explain that?

If you have carbon pricing and you have emitters, you can finance carbon dioxide removal through the revenues from carbon pricing. But if you want to go net negative, you need more removals than you have emissions. The question is, who’s going to pay for it? You would always have residual emitters, but if you want to go deeply into net negative, you will run out of revenue sources to finance these removals.

One of the big problems is, conceptually, a government can say, Okay, your factory does not have a license to produce anymore, and you can force it to close down. But you cannot force any entity to remove CO2 for you. So how can a government guarantee that these removals are really going to happen? Would the acceleration of this carbon dioxide removal actually work? Which methods do we prefer? Do we have enough geological storage? It’s all unresolved. This paper is not a call to Europe to say hey, just make a promise. [It’s saying,] can you please really think about it? Can we please stop assuming somebody is going to organize all this to go net negative and then it magically happens? You need to make a serious plan. And you may find out that it’s too hard to do.

Another question is, how will other actors react? I think that’s part of the reluctance to talk about going net negative. The mental model right now of being a frontrunner is going down to the net zero line and then waiting there for the others to come. But if you enter net negative territory, it becomes basically bottomless. So every developing country could, reasonably so, demand ever higher levels of you. In the European Union, where you have 27 member states, even there, you would get into distributional challenges because some member states may ask others to go net negative because they are disadvantaged.

Also, which sectors would be forced to go net negative, which ones can stay net positive? Agriculture, at least as long as you have livestock, will be net positive. Then you have a country like Ireland, with 30% of the emissions coming from agriculture. They will stay a net-positive country, probably, and then others would have to go net negative. So you can imagine what kind of tensions you would get in.

I know you’re not in Belém, but from what you’ve read and from what you’re hearing, do you think that overshoot and all of these questions that you raise are being discussed more there? Do you get the sense that they are making their way into the conversation more?

A bit. The talk you hear is only just about 1.5 and 1.5-aligned, and it makes you wonder what governments or NGOs think, how this is going to happen. In the text presented by the Brazilian government, overshoot is mentioned, and “limiting or minimizing magnitude and duration of overshoot.” But it does not talk about what that actually means.

The whole 1.5 conversation, I think it’s hard for governments to understand. At the same they’re getting told, “if you just look at the pledges, you will end up at 2.6 or 2.7 or 2.8 by the end of the century, you have to do more.” Of course they all have to do more, but to really get to 1.5 they have to do more than they can imagine. If the world does not want to cross 1.5, never ever, it would need to be at net-zero CO2 in 2030, between 2030 and 2035. And if you go later, then you have to go net negative. It’s actually quite easy, but it seems to be uncomfortable knowledge. And then the way we communicate the challenge — governments, scientists, media — it’s not very straightforward.

All these temperature targets are special in the sense that they set an absolute target. Usually policymakers, governments, set relative targets, like 0.7% of national GDP for overseas development aid — you can miss that every year, but then you can say, next year we’re going to meet it. That logic does not apply here. Once you are there, you are there. Then it’s not enough to say that next year we are going to put more effort into it. You just then can limit the extra damage.

The final resolution that concluded the United Nations climate summit in Brazil made no mention of fossil fuels, in what The New York Times called “a victory for oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia.” But the so-called COP30 confab in the northeastern Amazonian city of Belém made some notable progress. This was the first conference to seriously broach the effects of mining the metals needed for the energy transition, as I wrote here last week. The event had other firsts, as the Financial Times noted: It was the first completely spurned by the U.S. administration, “the first since the world hit 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming for an entire calendar year,” and — it turned out — “the first with a venue plagued by extreme heat, flooding — even a fire that brought the talks to a standstill for much of their second-last day.” But, FT columnist Pilita Clark continued, Brazil’s turn at the yearly summit “still managed something these huge annual gatherings should have done years ago: a shift away from showy pledges to tackling the real world complexities of cutting carbon emissions.”

The COP30 statement “does not spell out the implications or required response as bluntly as many want to see,” Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote, “It does, however, introduce an important new concept that could become a key part of the negotiations in the future. For the first time, the text references a resolve to ‘limit both the magnitude and duration of any temperature overshoot.’ This not only acknowledges that it’s possible to bring temperatures back down after warming surpasses 1.5 degrees, but that the level at which temperatures peak, and the length of time we remain at that peak before the world begins to cool, are just as important. The statement implies the need for a much larger conversation about carbon removal that has been nearly absent from the annual COPs, but which scientists say that countries must have if they are serious about the Paris Agreement goals.”

2. U.S. Export-Import Bank will invest $100 billion in ‘energy dominance’

The U.S. Export-Import Bank plans to invest $100 billion in overseas energy projects to promote President Donald Trump’s global energy dominance. The first tranche of funding will go to projects in Egypt, Pakistan, and Europe. In his first interview since taking office in September, the federal lender’s newly-appointed chair, John Jovanovic, told the FT the administration was focusing the bank on “efforts to secure U.S. and allied supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear energy, and liquified natural gas to counter western reliance on China and Russia.” In short, Jovanovic said, the Ex-Im Bank is “back in a big way, and it’s open for business.”

3. Wyoming is planning America’s first new coal plant in 12 years

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon last week announced $4 million in state matching funds to study building a second coal-fired unit at the Dry Fork Station power plant in Gillette. The move, Cowboy State Daily reported, “could be the first step toward building a new coal-fired power plant” in the sparsely populated state’s third-largest city. “This is clear proof that coal is not dead and a reminder that Wyoming’s strength has always come from our ability to innovate without abandoning our values,” Gordon, a Republican, said in a statement. If built, the plant would be the first new coal-fired unit to open in the U.S. since 2013.

The Trump administration is trying to keep existing coal plants open. But it’s running into the problem that their equipment keeps breaking down, as Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin wrote. The trend toward coal isn’t unique to Trump’s America. Coal demand is rising globally.

4. Oregon’s governor orders sweeping review of clean energy bottlenecks

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek ordered state agencies last week to speed up the government’s performance on permitting, energy efficiency, electrification, and low-carbon fuel. In a speech, the Democrat said her administration would pursue the cheapest pathway to the state’s 2040 target of decarbonizing electricity, E&E News reported. “We’re talking about what we really need to meet our [climate] goals in an affordable way… where we’re not getting help from the federal government,” Kotek said Wednesday at a press conference.

Democratic states are largely in a moment of flux on climate policy. California eased permitting restrictions and passed a series of bills on energy and emissions, as Emily laid out at the time. As I reported here last week, Pennsylvania took the opposite approach and withdrew from the multi-state cap-and-trade market under pressure to contain costs. New York, meanwhile, has required a federal judge to intervene to force its government to enforce climate regulations. It's all part of the emerging tension between Democrats' affordability campaigns and the party's desire to cut planet-heating pollution, as Heatmap's Robinson Meyer wrote.

5. British oil and gas developer Harbour Energy is pumped on the U.S.

Regular readers of this newsletter scarcely need reminding of two basic realities about the American oil and gas industry right now: Trump is opening virtually everywhere he can to production, but drilling has largely remained flat. But the market is looking good to the British developer Harbour Energy. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Linda Cook, the company’s chief executive, said Harbour Energy is exploring a potential acquisition or merger with rivals in the U.S. offshore and onshore drilling business as a way to enter “the biggest market in the world” where the London-headquartered firm isn’t already present. In a sign of confidence in Trump’s as-yet-unrealized promise to “drill, baby, drill,” Harbour Energy has widened its scope from its past inquiries into only U.S. offshore assets to also look at onshore drilling.

Oregon joined 21 other Democratic-led states in August to sue the federal government for threatening to withhold $1.4 billion in federal Victims of Crime Act funding unless the states agreed to help with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit never went to trial because the Trump administration abandoned its plan after the suit was filed, allowing states to retain federal grants without any new immigration enforcement rules.

It’s one of 46 lawsuits the state has filed against the Trump administration, often teaming up with other Democratic states to prevent federal funding cuts. The state of Oregon doesn’t have to pay anything out of pocket by signing onto another state’s lawsuit, according to Oregon Department of Justice spokesperson Jenny Hansson.

The Oregon Department of Justice has spent at least $19,000 in legal fees and travel expenses this year to send employees to attend court hearings in Washington D.C. and New York, according to public records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. Meanwhile, by filing the lawsuits the state has kept about $4.5 billion meant for Oregon Health and Science University research, electric vehicle infrastructure, sexual health education programs and education programs supporting low-income and unhoused students.

The lawsuits are to ensure Oregonians aren’t left paying the price when the federal government oversteps or breaks the law, Hansson said.

“The Oregon Department of Justice is committed to protecting Oregonians — not wasting their money,” Hansson told the Capital Chronicle. “The resources we’ve invested in defending Oregon’s rights in court are a fraction of what’s at stake.”

Oregon’s federal litigation team isn’t funded with direct taxpayer dollars

Some states set aside millions for potential lawsuits against the Trump administration. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom in late 2024 convened a special session to set aside $25 million to pay for anticipated legal costs against the Trump administration. In Maryland, Attorney General Anthony Brown received $1 million from the governor to fund a federal litigation team, Maryland Matters reported.

The state of Oregon did something similar, allocating $8.2 million in its 2025-27 Department of Justice’s budget to fund 20 full-time positions to support civil litigation and for the “defense of state interests.”

What’s unique about Oregon is that the money going toward defending state interests isn’t coming from the state general fund — or money collected from personal or corporate income taxes — but rather it’s coming from proceeds from civil litigation when the state is awarded damages, according to legislative fiscal analyst Steve Robbins.

With this designated funding, the department created a federal litigation team to respond to national legal issues. An agency webpage tracks all the lawsuits Oregon is a part of tied to immigration, human rights, LGBTQ+ issues, federal employment and other Trump administration policies.

In total, Oregon’s Department of Justice’s budget increased by 4% from the previous two-year cycle, raising its budget to $1 billion.

Some of that new funding also includes $17 million to support child advocacy centers and support services for domestic and sexual violence victims, $13 million to replace some of its legal software, $8.8 million to upgrade its child support software system and $10.8 million to add 33 full-time attorneys in its trial division to reduce the state’s need to contract with more expensive, private firms.

“We haven’t taken our eyes off the day-to-day work that matters to Oregonians,” Hansson said. “We continue to deliver on core services and priorities — protecting working families, seniors and consumers and keeping communities safe and defending Oregon’s values.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_6293-1024x6831764079593.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=8QZhEtMw,N,,2025-11-25 14:02:35.958142

“It is crucial for the United States to harness our abundant natural resources and increase our baseload energy capacity to unlock this once-in-a-generation opportunity,” the lawmakers, led by RSC Chairman August Pfluger (R., Texas) and Rep.
Troy Balderson (R., Ohio), wrote; Balderson is also the chairman of the House Energy Action Team (HEAT).

Lawmakers wrote to Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a letter obtained exclusively by the Washington Reporter, thanking Wright and President Donald Trump for their “thoughtful leadership on energy dominance and for your commitment to strengthening America’s grid to meet the emerging power demands of data centers and artificial intelligence (AI).” They specifically appreciate Trump’s Executive Order 14154, which “terminated harmful Biden-era policies, advanced meaningful improvements in the efficiency and certainty of permitting approvals, and supported critical baseload energy projects.”

But, they want the administration to do even more. “It is crucial for the United States to harness our abundant natural resources and increase our baseload energy capacity to unlock this once-in-a-generation opportunity,” the lawmakers, led by RSC Chairman August Pfluger (R., Texas) and Rep. Troy Balderson (R., Ohio), wrote; Balderson is also the chairman of the House Energy Action Team (HEAT).

The lawmakers’ letter comes as Republican lawmakers work with the administration to achieve the president’s goal of American energy dominance, and as Congress and the White House increasingly focus on affordability issues.

“Without sufficient energy to power our data centers and keep up with the rapid pace of technological innovation and development, our strategic adversaries, including China, may ultimately win the AI arms race. Failure is not an option, as our nation’s economic and national security are at stake,” lawmakers cautioned Wright.

Republican lawmakers have a desired solution: “We must increase the amount of new, reliable, baseload resources connected to the grid to adequately meet rising demand and offset planned retirements,” they wrote.

“As you consider funding allocations and other authorities to ensure the electric grid has the energy resources the nation needs to accommodate and enable this growth, we urge you to prioritize baseload energy generation sources,” the Republicans said. “Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants jointly accounted for 91 percent of planned retirements of power generation capacity in 2024. As grid operators and experts have warned, our nation cannot solely rely on weather-dependent, intermittent resources.”

“For these reasons, we respectfully urge the Department of Energy to exercise its authorities and programs to rapidly expand energy generation to reliably and affordably meet electricity demand growth across the country,” the lawmakers wrote. “Such action would align with the Trump Administration’s broader objectives of strengthening domestic supply chains and supporting American energy workers. We are committed to working with you, the Department of Energy, and President Trump to get out of the energy crisis caused by the Biden-Harris Administration’s deeply misguided policies and hostility towards domestic energy production. The golden age of technological innovation depends on a resilient grid and a reliable energy supply.”

Joining Reps. Balderson and Pfluger in signing the letter are Reps. Stephanie Bice (R., Okla.), Rick Allen (R., Ga.), Andy Barr (R., Ky.), Nick Begich (R., Alaska), Josh Brecheen (R., Okla.), Andrew Clyde (R., Ga.), Jeff Crank (R., Colo.), Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Vince Fong (R., Calif.), Scott Franklin (R., Fla.), Craig Goldman (R., Texas), Morgan Griffith (R., Va.), Harriet Hageman (R., Wyo.), Pat Harrigan (R., N.C.), Jeff Hurd (R., Colo.), Bob Latta (R., Ohio), Laurel Lee (R., Fla.), Rich McCormick (R., Ga.), Dan Newhouse (R., Wash.), Gary Palmer (R., Ala.), John Rose (R., Tenn.), Pete Sessions (R., Texas), Randy Weber (R., Texas), and Roger Williams (R., Texas).","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Iqp!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4146e4a-3308-4980-b46e-e1aefa64d1a3_1200x630.jpeg",N,,2025-11-25 10:01:59.155570

Oregon joined 21 other Democratic-led states in August to sue the federal government for threatening to withhold $1.4 billion in federal Victims of Crime Act funding unless the states agreed to help with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit never went to trial because the Trump administration abandoned its plan after the suit was filed, allowing states to retain federal grants without any new immigration enforcement rules.

It’s one of 46 lawsuits the state has filed against the Trump administration, often teaming up with other Democratic states to prevent federal funding cuts. The state of Oregon doesn’t have to pay anything out of pocket by signing onto another state’s lawsuit, according to Oregon Department of Justice spokesperson Jenny Hansson.

The Oregon Department of Justice has spent at least $19,000 in legal fees and travel expenses this year to send employees to attend court hearings in Washington D.C. and New York, according to public records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. Meanwhile, by filing the lawsuits the state has kept about $4.5 billion meant for Oregon Health and Science University research, electric vehicle infrastructure, sexual health education programs and education programs supporting low-income and unhoused students.

The lawsuits are to ensure Oregonians aren’t left paying the price when the federal government oversteps or breaks the law, Hansson said.

“The Oregon Department of Justice is committed to protecting Oregonians — not wasting their money,” Hansson told the Capital Chronicle. “The resources we’ve invested in defending Oregon’s rights in court are a fraction of what’s at stake.”

Oregon’s federal litigation team isn’t funded with direct taxpayer dollars

Some states set aside millions for potential lawsuits against the Trump administration. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom in late 2024 convened a special session to set aside $25 million to pay for anticipated legal costs against the Trump administration. In Maryland, Attorney General Anthony Brown received $1 million from the governor to fund a federal litigation team, Maryland Matters reported.

The state of Oregon did something similar, allocating $8.2 million in its 2025-27 Department of Justice’s budget to fund 20 full-time positions to support civil litigation and for the “defense of state interests.”

What’s unique about Oregon is that the money going toward defending state interests isn’t coming from the state general fund — or money collected from personal or corporate income taxes — but rather it’s coming from proceeds from civil litigation when the state is awarded damages, according to legislative fiscal analyst Steve Robbins.

With this designated funding, the department created a federal litigation team to respond to national legal issues. An agency webpage tracks all the lawsuits Oregon is a part of tied to immigration, human rights, LGBTQ+ issues, federal employment and other Trump administration policies.

In total, Oregon’s Department of Justice’s budget increased by 4% from the previous two-year cycle, raising its budget to $1 billion.

Some of that new funding also includes $17 million to support child advocacy centers and support services for domestic and sexual violence victims, $13 million to replace some of its legal software, $8.8 million to upgrade its child support software system and $10.8 million to add 33 full-time attorneys in its trial division to reduce the state’s need to contract with more expensive, private firms.

“We haven’t taken our eyes off the day-to-day work that matters to Oregonians,” Hansson said. “We continue to deliver on core services and priorities — protecting working families, seniors and consumers and keeping communities safe and defending Oregon’s values.”",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6293-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 10:01:34.573670

In July 2025, a devastating flood in Central Texas claimed the lives of at least 135 people when the Guadalupe River rose 31 feet in 90 minutes, becoming the deadliest inland U.S. flooding event in almost 50 years.1 Floods can be life-changing, and they are becoming more frequent and severe as fossil-fueled climate change is making rainfall heavier and flooding events more intense in many areas.2 As of mid-November, more than 5,000 flash flood warnings have been issued across all weather-forecasting offices nationwide—the first time the number has crossed the 5,000-warning mark in a year, and 2025 is not over yet.3

The total annual economic burden of flooding in the United States totals between $179.8 billion and $496 billion when factoring in a broader spectrum of impacts, such as annual loss in tax revenue, increases in insurance premiums, damage to ecosystem services, and damage to transit infrastructure from flooding.4 Floods can also lead to serious and often-overlooked risks to public health, upend lives, cause infrastructure damage, and bring contamination and disease—especially for those already vulnerable.5 Working-class, low-income, Black, Latino, Indigenous, and other underserved communities experience disproportionately high impacts from flooding and take longer to recover.6

Climate change and the built environment contribute to increased flooding

As the Earth warms up due to fossil-fueled climate change, flooding becomes increasingly destructive.7 A warmer world means increased evaporation, which supercharges storms to produce more rain, resulting in higher chances of flooding.8 In the United States, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation have occurred since 1995.9 Looking forward, one study found that extreme rainfall events in the United States could become three times more likely and up to 20 percent more severe within the next 45 years.10 Other conditions—such as drought or a recent wildfire, which climate change has also made more frequent—can make it harder for the ground to absorb water, making flooding impacts even more devastating for Americans.11

Extreme rainfall events in the United States could become three times more likely and up to 20 percent more severe within the next 45 years.

Whether the environment is built or natural also determines how severe flooding will be and how quickly communities can build back. Hardened shorelines—those reinforced with artificial structures such as bulkheads and seawalls—can cause shoreline erosion, making the risks of coastal flooding higher over time.12 Impermeable surfaces such as asphalt and concrete can also significantly increase the risk of flooding. When 10 to 20 percent of a watershed has impervious cover, the amount of runoff doubles.13 Short bursts of intense rainfall over major metropolitan areas can rapidly create flash flood conditions that overwhelm sewer systems when trash and debris clog drains.14 For example, a recent October storm in New York City broke three daily rainfall records, triggered numerous flash flood warnings that led to two deaths, left 1,500 residents without electricity, and flooded roads.15

In comparison, natural environments and ecosystems such as floodplains can reduce the impacts of flooding by providing natural flood and erosion control and by slowing runoff.16

Flooding risks vary in the United States by region and type of weather event

Flooding can occur in a variety of ways, and different regions of the United States will experience distinct climate change impacts. In the Northeast, river flooding may become larger and more frequent.17 Meanwhile, the Southwest is expected to experience more drought conditions with flooding expected to become less frequent.18

The commonality is how climate change is making flooding events worse. As global temperatures continue to rise, the atmosphere holds more moisture: For every 1-degree Celsius increase in temperature, air can hold 7 percent more moisture.19 More atmospheric moisture leads to more frequent and heavier rainfall over shorter periods of time.

Flash floods

The most dangerous type of flooding is flash floods, which happen within minutes or hours of rainfall starting.20 They occur when rainfall is no longer able to be absorbed by the ground due to factors such as drought or the presence of impermeable surfaces such as concrete roads—or when a river dam breaks.21 Forecasting precisely where a relatively small storm may cause flash flooding is difficult because the storm and local hydrological conditions can change rapidly.22 Flash floods claim an average of 100 lives each year in the United States and 5,000 lives globally.23

River flooding

River flooding, also known as inland flooding, occurs when water levels top river banks following heavy or sustained rainfall from storms and runoff from snowmelt.24 River flooding can happen at any time of the year and anywhere in the country. Sustained rainfall from tropical cyclones and hurricanes has caused disastrous floods, such as in Texas in 2019 during Tropical Storm Imelda and in North Carolina in 2018 during Hurricane Florence.25 And in 2017, human-induced climate change likely increased Hurricane Harvey’s total rainfall by at least 19 percent in the Houston area.26 Warmer temperatures can also lead to more frequent drought conditions and soil that is less able to absorb moisture.27

Coastal impacts

Rising sea levels and the increasing severity and frequency of hurricanes put coastal communities more at risk.28 Global average sea level has risen 8 to 9 inches since 1880, and that rate is accelerating as ice floes melt and warmer water temperatures cause thermal expansion due to climate change.29 One in 10 Americans live in coastal areas at risk of flooding.30 Over the next 30 years, sea levels along the contiguous U.S. coast are expected to rise by as much as 1 foot—about the same amount of sea level rise observed across the past century.31 Projected increases in sea level rise could lead to more coastal flooding events and 10 times the number of damaging flooding events over the next 30 years.32

Flooding’s harms to public health are both immediate and long term

Floods are among the most frequent and deadly climate-fueled disasters, yet their hidden toll on public health is vastly undercounted.33 Beyond the immediate danger of drowning, floods silently unleash cascading health crises that can unfold over weeks, months, and even years.

Immediate health impacts

The health threats begin the moment floodwaters rise. During flash floods and coastal floods, drowning is the leading cause of death as fast-moving water can sweep away cars and people in seconds; just 6 inches of water is enough to knock someone off their feet, and just 1 to 2 feet of rushing water is enough to carry away most cars, SUVs, and trucks.34 Rushing currents can carry raw sewage, glass, hazardous household waste, medical waste, pesticides, lumber, and farm waste.35 This toxic slurry can cause gastrointestinal illness; eye, ear, and skin infections; and long-term respiratory issues.36 Flooded areas often also contain live power lines, posing a major electrocution risk.37

In addition, flooding triggers severe disruptions to health care systems.38 Roads may be washed out, becoming unnavigable for emergency vehicles.39 Clinics and hospitals can lose power, flood, or close entirely. Supply chains can be interrupted, delaying critical medications and medical devices. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy sent floodwaters surging into Coney Island Hospital in New York, knocking out both electricity and backup generators.40 The state’s health care system was rocked by the storm, with more than 6,400 patients forced to evacuate.41 Coney Island Hospital shut down for three months and redirected patients to nearby facilities—many of which were also overwhelmed with patients and the storm’s impact on infrastructure or were damaged by the storm.42 In total, six hospitals and 26 residential care facilities in New York City alone closed due to Sandy.43

Disease and outbreaks—particularly waterborne illnesses such as cholera, typhoid, and leptospirosis—are huge health concerns after a flood because of exposure to contaminated water.44 Stagnant pools become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which can spread diseases such as malaria, Zika virus, and dengue fever.45 After heavy monsoon flooding in Bangladesh in 2020, for instance, dengue fever cases spiked to more than 100,000, killing nearly 200 people.46 Higher temperatures due to climate change are increasing the incidence of dengue fever, particularly in places where it was once uncommon, such as California, Texas, Hawaii, Florida, and Europe.47

Long-term health impacts

As floodwaters recede, additional threats emerge. New research estimates that in the year following major floods, the United States saw more than 22,000 excess deaths.48 Flooding also creates dangerous conditions for respiratory health.49 Mold and dampness can quickly overtake water-damaged homes, triggering respiratory flare-ups, allergic reactions, and fungal infections, especially in people with asthma or compromised immune systems.50 The risk grows for flood-displaced individuals living in overcrowded shelters.51 Poor ventilation and limited sanitation increase exposure to airborne pathogens and fungi, compounding health risks and prolonging recovery.

Floods can also leave deep psychological scars that often go uncounted. Although the physical destruction of flooding is immediately visible, its mental health toll can emerge slowly and last for years.52 Survivors commonly experience anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, and even psychosis—especially when recovery is prolonged or support systems falter. Research from the United Kingdom found that people affected by floods were 4 to 8.7 times more likely to suffer long-term mental health issues than those who were not.53 In some cases, even rainfall can retraumatize people.54 The cleanup and rebuilding process itself is a major stressor, particularly when compounded by inadequate government or private-sector response.55

Jackson, Mississippi

In August 2022, heavy rainfall and a slow-moving weather system caused the Pearl River to flood parts of central Mississippi including the capital city of Jackson.56 The river rose almost 20 feet, nearly reaching a major flood stage.57 The area is situated in a low-lying delta that is prone to sinking land and repeated flooding.58

While the immediate damage to homes and neighborhoods was minimal, the flood waters inundated Jackson’s main water treatment facility, overwhelming the pump system and causing it to fail.59 The shutdown cut off safe drinking water to more than 180,000 people for weeks and exposed the majority-Black population to pollutants.60

As climate change causes flooding to increase, aging infrastructure across the country will become more vulnerable to failures that put communities at risk.61 A recent report found that investments in making infrastructure more resilient, such as protecting wastewater treatment facilities, can return as much as $31 per dollar invested.62

Economic risks

As flooding grows more frequent and severe, the economic risks are no longer confined to isolated disasters; they are systemic, compounding, and reverberate throughout a community. Recent major floods have devastated countless communities, and once-rare disasters have turned into regular financial shocks. The total annual economic burden of flooding in the United States is estimated to range from $179.8 billion to $496 billion,63 or as much as 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 dollars, when accounting for often-overlooked costs such as crop losses, increased insurance premiums, costs associated with flooding deaths, and damages to uninsured homes. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average cost of each flooding event is $4.5 billion.64 Even minor flooding can trigger major costs: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates that just 5 inches of water in a home can cause more than $25,000 in damage.65 These losses are not only staggering in scale; they are growing, compounding, and unequally distributed.66

The total annual economic burden of flooding in the United States is estimated to range from $179.8 billion to $496 billion.

Each sector in the U.S. economy faces flood impacts, but the agricultural industry, in particular, experiences major losses. Most crops in North America are not flood tolerant, and flooding may lead to conditions that favor disease development.67 In 2024, one study found that flooding caused more than $6 billion of estimated total crop losses in the United States.68 Hurricane Helene alone caused more than $5 billion in damages for the agriculture and forestry industry in the state of Georgia.69 As climate change increases the frequency of heavy precipitation that can erode soil and deplete nutrients, food security may change for some households.70

Flood insurance

Flood insurance is a critical pillar of the nation’s flood response. However, across the United States, millions of homes and buildings face far greater flood risk than accounted for in conventional planning and insurance models.71 New analyses that factor in sea level rise, rainfall intensity, and previously overlooked inland waterways show that more than 14 million properties—far more than previous estimates—are now at risk from a so-called 100-year flood.72 This hidden vulnerability is especially pronounced in cities such as Chicago, Buffalo, and Chattanooga, where tens of thousands of properties face previously unrecognized flooding threats.73

Millions of households remain uninsured, ineligible for federal assistance, or undersupported by existing aid programs, leaving residents vulnerable to financial ruin after a flood.74 The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), designed to help property owners recover from flood losses, has faced growing financial strain in the face of worsening disasters.75 Between 2007 and 2017, the NFIP paid out an average of $2.9 billion per year in flood-related claims, with costs spiking in years marked by severe storms.76 After Hurricane Ian hit Florida in 2022, the program fielded more than 37,000 flood insurance claims.77 As the frequency and intensity of flooding increase, the gap between insured losses and total damages is expected to widen, further exposing households, small businesses, and local governments to unsustainable economic risk.

Communities face unequal impacts from floods

Flooding can happen almost anywhere, but resources for preparedness and recovery vary widely. Climate change creates unequal burdens on communities, especially harming communities of color, lower-income households, older adults, children, and people experiencing homelessness.78 These communities often face a greater likelihood of flood damage, costly repairs, and health disparities and are slower to financially recover than wealthier communities.79

Discriminatory housing policies such as redlining have placed communities of color in poorly maintained floodplains; the lowest-lying land; or areas that lack adequate stormwater infrastructure, which increases the risk for flooding.80 For example, Hispanic residents are 50 percent more likely to live in a 500-year floodplain, while Black communities are forecasted to have a disproportionate share of future flood damages.81 An analysis of nearly 10 years of NFIP data found that almost 20 percent of flood relief claims were paid to ZIP codes where at least 25 percent of the residents are Black—despite Black Americans making up only 13 percent of the U.S. population during the same time period.82 Average annual losses in census tracts with a population of at least 20 percent Black residents are projected to roughly double that of census tracts where Black residents make up less than 1 percent of the population.83

There are countless other examples of communities of color at increased risk for flooding:

Many Indigenous communities live in areas at risk for coastal and river flooding.84 In October, Typhoon Halong devastated Indigenous communities in western Alaska when a storm surge and high winds caused water levels to rise 6 feet above the highest normal tide line, sweeping away homes in low-lying communities. Kipnuk, one of the affected villages, had been a recipient of a $20 million grant through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Change Grants Program.85 This program, which was recently canceled, aimed to help low-income and disadvantaged communities address climate risks such as erosion and flooding.

In Chicago, a study found that a staggering 87 percent of more than 225,000 insurance claims from urban flooding over nine years were from households of color.86

Low-income populations are also more vulnerable to inequities in flooding response and recovery. Mobile homes—an affordable housing option for many families—face a higher risk of flooding than other housing types: One out of 7 mobile homes are in high-flood risk census tracts, compared with 1 out of 10 for other housing types.87 While renters are able to receive financial assistance through FEMA after a disaster, access is often complicated by factors such as renters not having a formal lease agreement, the complicated application process, and language barriers. Those without access to a car are also less likely to evacuate, reach evacuation centers, or even return home once flooding recedes.88 Disasters increase wealth inequality over time: Families already financially struggling can experience harms to credit scores, increases in debt, and higher chances of defaulting on loans or declaring bankruptcy after disasters.89

Ways to address the impacts of floods

Floods pose a growing threat to the American economy, public health, and lives while disproportionately affecting already vulnerable communities. Government leaders must prioritize investments in and the implementation of solutions to alleviate these increasingly devastating consequences.

Investing in resilience

The escalating costs of flooding underscore the value of investing in resilience. In recent years, landmark legislation—including the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , and the Water Resources Development Act of 2022—has delivered major funding to help communities adapt to climate-driven flooding.90 These investments are not only necessary but also cost-effective: Every $1 spent on flood protection can yield between $5 and $8 in avoided damages.91

Every $1 spent on flood protection can yield between $5 and $8 in avoided damages.

Smart investments in flood mitigation, infrastructure upgrades, and natural protections can deliver outsized benefits, often saving many times more than the investments cost. To avoid escalating losses and protect long-term economic security, policymakers must prioritize forward-looking flood resilience across federal, state, and local levels, treating it not as a one-time expense but a national economic imperative.

Funding scientific research and access to disaster relief

NOAA, FEMA, and other agencies that provide weather and climate monitoring and disaster relief need to be adequately funded and staffed. FEMA is a critical agency in disaster response and recovery, and NOAA provides scientific assessments and data along with forecasting.92 Programs such as the NOAA Global Systems Laboratory, National Weather Service, and National Hurricane Center are vital in disaster preparedness and response.93

Incorporating nature-based solutions

Nature-based solutions are a powerful, underutilized tool in cutting flood risk. Wetlands, marshes, and mangroves can reduce storm surge and absorb excess water, offering flood protection with long-term economic and environmental benefits.94 Conserving and restoring coastal habitats can help protect communities from extreme weather while also supporting wildlife and providing ecosystem services.95 Increasing usage of living shorelines and permeable surfaces can help reduce risks of catastrophic flooding and can both protect coastal areas from severe storms and help improve coastal resiliency.96 A recent study found that every $1 invested in restoring coastal wetlands can generate $7 in direct flood reduction benefits.97 During Hurricane Sandy, coastal wetlands in the northeastern United States prevented an estimated $625 million in direct flood damages.98

Improving risk assessment, pricing, and planning

Measures can be taken before a flood to mitigate property damage and economic risk. Insurers should be required to account for proven mitigation measures in their pricing decisions.99 Flood disclosure laws should also be improved so that prospective renters and homebuyers are well-informed about a property’s flood history.100 Additionally, reforms to the NFIP should be made to avoid incentivizing development in high-risk areas while ensuring policies remain affordable.101 FEMA’s flood risk maps should also be updated to include risk from increased rainfall.102 And in some cases, managed retreat efforts should be considered to help communities relocate out of flood-prone areas.103

Conclusion

The impacts of floods on communities do not end when the waters recede. Improvements can be made to how the United States handles flooding before, during, and after the event. As climate change fuels more and increasingly intense flooding events, it is critical to ensure that communities are well-equipped to withstand the harmful economic and health impacts while also making sure that working-class, low-income, Black, Latino, Indigenous, and other underserved communities are not overlooked.

The timing could not be more brutal. As China’s EV market drowns in overcapacity and Europe’s sales stagnate, India has emerged as the rare bright spot where electric vehicle adoption is actually accelerating.

India’s EV Share Doubles in One Year

Electric models now account for more than 5% of new car sales in India, up from just 2.5% a year earlier, Tata Motors CEO Shailesh Chandra told Bloomberg at the launch of the new Tata Sierra SUV on Tuesday.

“It’s a good thing because that is what is creating excitement in the market,” Chandra said of the flood of new competitors. “A set of competitive products from multiple brands builds confidence in the category.”

That’s a remarkably diplomatic spin on what the numbers actually show: Tata is getting crushed.

Tata’s Market Share Collapse

Between January and August 2025, Tata’s EV market share plummeted to 35% from 59% in the same period last year, according to a BloombergNEF report dated October 3.

JSW MG Motor India, a joint venture between India’s JSW Group and China’s SAIC Motor, now commands 30% of the market, up from 25% last year. Mahindra & Mahindra has captured 22.6% as of August.

The three companies together control over 87% of India’s electric passenger vehicle market. But the leadership dynamics are shifting fast.

Tata’s comfortable dominance is evaporating precisely as global heavyweights arrive to compete for what remains a tiny but rapidly expanding prize.

Tesla and VinFast Join the Fight

Tesla opened its first Indian showroom in Mumbai on July 15, with a second location in New Delhi following later that month. The American automaker is selling made-in-China EVs, having declined India’s push for local manufacturing despite incentives offering reduced import duties.

Vietnam’s VinFast is also entering the fray, with an India factory slated to begin operations soon. The company has been negotiating a $200 million loan from Indian lenders to finance its expansion into the subcontinent’s massive car market.

Both companies join a growing roster that includes homegrown players and Chinese rivals spanning the full price spectrum, from budget hatchbacks to luxury SUVs.

The 2030 Price Parity Promise

Chandra predicts entry-level EVs will match gasoline car prices by 2030 while offering around 400 kilometers (249 miles) of range.

Currently, affordable EVs cost 25-30% more than their gasoline equivalents and deliver under 300 kilometers (186 miles) per charge. That gap is closing as automakers integrate components beyond lithium-ion cells into compact modules.

“What used to be multiple separate parts are now being merged into single units,” Chandra said. “The industry has moved from one function in one unit to several combined in one, which is driving down costs.”

Tata Motors, which also owns Jaguar Land Rover, expects nearly one-third of its total sales to come from EVs by 2030. The company aims to reclaim 45-50% market share through a broader product lineup spanning mass-market and premium segments.

The new Tata Sierra, a revival of the cult 1990s SUV positioned as a “premium mid-SUV,” will receive an electric version in early 2026.

Headwinds Beyond Competition

India’s EV momentum faces resistance from multiple directions.

Hyundai Motor and Kia are preparing hybrid offerings for the Indian market, providing a practical middle ground for consumers worried about charging infrastructure. India’s charging network remains sparse compared to developed markets.

The government also implemented consumption tax cuts on petrol cars in September, making conventional gasoline vehicles cheaper at the worst possible time for EV adoption.

Still, BloombergNEF projects India’s EV sales could exceed 650,000 units by 2030 as battery prices decline and more models enter the market.

EVXL’s Take

Tata Motors’ optimistic rhetoric about competition “building confidence” masks a brutal reality: the company that pioneered India’s EV market is watching its first-mover advantage dissolve in real-time.

This story is significant because India represents something increasingly rare in the global EV landscape: a market that’s actually growing. When we covered Europe’s EV sales plunge in June, the contrast with emerging Asian markets was already becoming clear. China’s market is saturated with 129 brands fighting over scraps, and the brutal consolidation we’ve documented will leave only 15 survivors by 2030.

India is the last major battleground where the EV war hasn’t already been decided.

The irony of Chandra’s position is striking. He’s celebrating competition while his company hemorrhages market share. Tata’s slide from 59% to 35% in just eight months signals that being first doesn’t guarantee being best when well-funded competitors show up with aggressive pricing and fresh products.

Tesla’s entry adds another dimension. When we reported on India’s EV policy and Tesla’s hesitation to manufacture locally, the American automaker seemed content to sit out India’s nascent market. Now it’s selling imported Chinese-made vehicles while Indian regulators watch and wait.

VinFast’s arrival is perhaps more telling. As we covered just days ago, VinFast’s losses nearly doubled to $911 million as its premium pricing strategy collapses against Chinese competition. The Vietnamese automaker is betting that India’s price-sensitive consumers will respond better than Americans did. Given VinFast’s negative 56% gross margins, that’s a gamble funded entirely by billionaire Pham Nhat Vuong’s personal fortune.

The broader pattern here connects directly to what we’ve been documenting about subsidy-dependent EV markets facing reality. India never had the massive government incentives that distorted Western markets. Its EV adoption is growing on fundamentals: falling costs, improving technology, and genuine consumer demand.

That makes India a natural experiment in whether EVs can succeed without artificial support. The 5% market share isn’t impressive by Chinese or European standards, but it doubled in one year without $7,500 tax credits propping up demand.

Tata’s 2030 vision of price parity might arrive faster than expected if competition continues intensifying. The question is whether Tata will still be leading when it does.

For now, India’s EV market remains a story of potential rather than achievement. But with every major global automaker now circling, the sleepy 2.5% market share of just 12 months ago is about to become unrecognizable.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_0224.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:01:54.920462

Summary

The IEA’s 2025 World Energy Outlook projects more resilient global crude oil demand than previously modeled, reinforcing the long-term call on U.S. production and supporting sustained volumes for midstream infrastructure.

The “Age of Electricity” is revitalizing domestic natural gas demand, which creates opportunities for midstream companies.

The US remains well positioned to meet rising demand from developing economies for liquefied natural gas and petrochemical feedstocks.

Earlier this month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its annual World Energy Outlook, a report that explores a range of scenarios for the global energy landscape. This year’s analysis marked a significant change from prior years, with the theme centering on energy security rather than climate and the shift to cleaner fuel sources. Learn how key takeaways around oil demand, natural gas and rising global energy exports have positive read-through for U.S. midstream.

The CPS Returns in This Year’s WEO

This year’s report has three main scenarios, with the IEA reintroducing its Current Policies Scenario (CPS) after a five-year absence. The CPS offers a cautious perspective on the energy system by strictly modeling outcomes based on current policies and regulations. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) considers a broader range of policies that have been formally put forward or announced alongside existing strategy documents. The final pathway is the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), which reflects the specific steps required to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

A Revised Outlook for Durable Global Crude Oil Demand

The 2025 Outlook marks a significant change from prior year reports that had modeled peak fossil fuel demand by 2030. The scenarios offer more robust assessments of demand growth for crude oil and natural gas, while acknowledging that renewable power alone will not be enough to support global energy needs for the foreseeable future. In the CPS model, global demand for oil rises ~13% to 2050, driven by increased use for road transport, petrochemical feedstocks, and aviation in emerging and developing economies. Oil remains the dominant fuel to 2050 in the CPS, and India overtakes China to become the main driver of oil demand growth.

In the STEPS model, global oil demand would peak around 2030 compared with before 2030 in the 2024 STEPS model. Global oil demand out to 2050 is also higher in this year’s STEPS model, as can be seen in the below chart. For context, global oil demand was 103 million barrels per day (MMBpd) in 2024.

In both scenarios, the U.S. remains the world’s largest oil producer to 2050. Importantly, the scenarios this year signal the durability of crude oil demand, pushing back on the idea that peak oil consumption is imminent. Even in the STEPS model, which anticipates a peak around 2030, the subsequent decline is modeled to be much shallower than previously expected.

For the U.S. midstream sector, this combination of dominant U.S. production and resilient global consumption is constructive. It suggests that the call on U.S. infrastructure will endure, keeping volumes for oil pipelines and marine terminals high and supporting sustained free cash flow. Notably, this implies a solid outlook for midstream even without the tailwind of natural gas demand, which is modeled to grow rapidly over the next decade.

The Expanding Role of Domestic Natural Gas in the “Age of Electricity”

The IEA’s 2025 report highlights the resurgence of domestic power demand, with U.S. natural gas demand in the STEPS model higher than in 2024’s report. In the CPS model, U.S. natural gas demand grows by 8.5% or 7.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) through 2035, driven by a 4.8 Bcf/d increase related to power generation. In the STEPS model, U.S. natural gas demand peaks around 2030 and returns to 2024 levels by 2035. The IEA notes that upward revisions in natural gas demand are driven by higher expectations for data center demand (read more) and regulatory shifts, keeping natural gas central to the energy mix well into the 2030s.

This trend is underpinned by what the IEA terms the “Age of Electricity,” where U.S. demand is projected to rise sharply due to the rapid proliferation of data centers supporting artificial intelligence (AI). To meet the 24/7 reliability required by hyperscalers, utilities are requiring new pipeline capacity to fuel gas-fired power plants that backstop renewables. At the same time, tech companies are increasingly bypassing the grid via Behind-the-Meter (BTM) arrangements, where power generation is co-located on site.

Within midstream, Williams (WMB) has three BTM projects underway through its Power Innovation business, while also pursuing pipeline expansions. MPLX (MPLX) recently signed a letter of intent with MARA Holdings (MARA) to supply gas for up to 1.5 GW of on-site generation in the Permian. Other midstream names are building or expanding pipelines to help meet growing natural gas demand for power generation, including Energy Transfer (ET), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and DT Midstream (DTM) to name a few.

U.S. Continues to Dominate LNG Exports

Rising global demand for U.S. LNG is driving growth opportunities for midstream. Based on projects under construction, global LNG export capacity is set to increase by ~54% to 83.2 Bcf/d by 2030. The U.S. is central to this expansion, accounting for roughly half of global growth and doubling its own export capacity by 2031 as shown below (read more). Midstream is investing in new feed-gas pipelines to transport volumes from the Haynesville and Permian basins to Gulf Coast export terminals.

In the CPS model, global demand keeps pace with the rapid capacity buildout. Natural gas demand from developing economies, the primary driver of LNG export growth, increases by 67.2 Bcf/d through 2035 and 129.0 Bcf/d by 2050. In this scenario, new capacity is fully utilized, primarily driven by Asian export growth.

In the STEPS model, slower demand growth creates a temporary surplus. Natural gas demand from developing economies grows by 52.8 Bcf/d to 2035 and 74.4 Bcf/d to 2050. The resulting global LNG surplus of 6.3 Bcf/d in 2030 is gradually worked off by 2035.

Petrochemicals Largest Driver of Future Oil Demand

Alongside natural gas, developing markets are also expected to drive export growth in natural gas liquids (NGLs). Recovered from natural gas streams, these hydrocarbons meet distinct international needs. Ethane acts as a primary feedstock ethylene, the critical building block for plastics and industrial products. Demand is anchored by Asian manufacturing growth, with overseas petrochemical crackers relying primarily on U.S. ethane. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is composed of propane and butane and serves as a vital residential fuel for cooking and heating across developing economies.

In its 2025 report, the IEA revised its NGL outlook upward and identified petrochemicals as the primary driver of future oil demand growth.

The U.S. is positioned as the dominant global supplier in LPG exports, accounting for about half of the overall market. To support these volumes, major midstream players including Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), ET, and Targa Resources (TRGP) are heavily investing in NGL infrastructure, advancing multiple projects to expand fractionation capacity and export terminals (read more). Growing demand for U.S. energy creates a sustained volume tailwind for midstream.

The midstream companies mentioned above are included in the Alerian Energy Infrastructure index suite. The suite includes a number of indexes that are tracked by investable products, providing investors with a pathway to invest in U.S. energy leadership.

North Carolina has about 525,000 manufactured homes, representing more than 10% of the state’s housing stock.
Around 12% of total housing stock in South Carolina and Alabama, and 7.4% in Georgia, is manufactured housing.","Though much less expensive to produce and purchase, manufactured housing is also much less common than site-built single-family homes in the U.S.

For this reason, wider adoption of manufactured homes has been identified as one among many proposals for alleviating the affordable housing shortage in the U.S.

An omnibus bipartisan housing bill passed by the U.S. Senate as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026, now awaiting reconciliation with the House of Representatives, specifically calls for expanding financing and market access for manufactured and modular homes.

If passed, for example, one of bills bundled in the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream (ROAD) to Housing Act of 2025 would direct the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to update its definition of “manufactured housing” to include modular and other prefabricated units not built on a permanent foundation or “chassis.”

A separate bill in the ROAD Act would direct HUD to expand eligibility for mortgage financing on factory-built housing through the HUD-administered Federal Housing Administration.

At approximately 7.9 million units nationwide, manufactured housing comprises just 5.4% of total U.S. housing stock. In certain markets around the country, however, manufactured homes play a disproportionate role in plugging the affordable housing gap.

The average new manufactured home sold for just over $123,000 in 2024 — less than half the national median home price, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data conducted by StorageCafe, a storage space listing platform operated by property analytics and technology provider Yardi Systems.

Mesa, Ariz., leads U.S. cities with 29,000 manufactured housing units. Phoenix is second with 20,000 units, followed by Jacksonville, Fla., with 15,000.

In Mesa, that represents 13% of the city’s overall housing stock, while in Phoenix and Jacksonville it represents just 3%.

Largo, Fla., and Hemet, Calif., have the largest share of manufactured housing among total housing stock at 28% and 21% respectively, followed by Yuma, Ariz., Lakeland, Fla., and Port Orange, Fla., all at 17%.

The common misconception that manufactured homes do not appreciate commensurate with site-built units, lending manufactured homes the illusion of being poor long-term assets that shed resale value, does not bear out in federal housing data.

According to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which regulates government-sponsored mortgage investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, manufactured homes and site-built homes have appreciated at roughly the same rate from the first quarter of 2000 to the second quarter of 2025, up 219.1% and 219.9%, respectively.

A research note published in October by the Urban Institute, a national housing policy think tank, called this trend “strong evidence that this negative perception of home price appreciation is false,” underscoring how manufactured homes have seen higher annual appreciation than site-built homes “in nearly every quarter” over the past decade.

Urban Institute’s analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data revealed that mortgage applications for manufactured homes were rejected at a rate of 57.8% in 2024 compared to site-built denial rates of just 10%, highlighting barriers to financing expanded adoption.

At the state level, manufactured housing is prevalent in the South, including Florida, Texas and North Carolina.

At 824,000 units, manufactured homes make up slightly less than 8% of Florida’s total housing stock, according to the StorageCafe analysis. The 776,000 units in Texas make up 6.2% of that state’s total housing stock.

North Carolina has about 525,000 manufactured homes, representing more than 10% of the state’s housing stock. Around 12% of total housing stock in South Carolina and Alabama, and 7.4% in Georgia, is manufactured housing.

With more than 507,000 units in California, manufactured homes comprise just 3.4% of the state’s roughly 15 million housing units but provide the greatest sale-price savings nationwide. The average new manufactured home in California sold for $167,000 in 2024 compared to the overall average home price of $759,500, according to StorageCafe.",https://www.scotsmanguide.com/files/sites/2/2025/11/Manufactured-homes-gain-policy-momentum-amid-affordable-supply-shortage.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 13:01:48.471911

Newsom must stop deferring to corporate utilities like PG&E and mobilize the state to support rooftop solar, virtual power plants and other clean, decentralized electricity solutions.","Governor Gavin Newsom stood before global leaders in Brazil recently at COP30, the annual United Nations climate conference, and introduced himself to the world as the new face of U.S. climate ambition.

The scene raised a question back home in California: Why did Newsom recently veto climate solutions that would have made electricity cleaner and more affordable for Californians?

For decades, California has shown the world that states and regions can drive climate and economic progress, even when national governments lag.

Now the world’s fourth-largest economy, our state has paired consistent cuts in emissions with sustained economic growth and set a standard for clean car rules that is copied worldwide. It also built the nation’s first economy-wide “Cap and Invest” program, the cap-and-trade energy credit program recently reformed and extended under Newsom’s watch.

Yet as the climate crisis escalates, even that legacy faces scrutiny. While Newsom was preparing for COP30, his administration was delaying or diluting key domestic reforms and quietly expanding in-state oil and gas drilling.

In Brazil, Newsom urged fellow Democrats to start framing climate as an affordability issue — of course, it is. This rhetoric earned him praise abroad.

But Newsom has balked at several recent opportunities to address climate and cost-of-living challenges together.

Just weeks ago, the governor vetoed three bipartisan bills that would have advanced virtual power plants, which are systems that deliver clean power back to the electrical grid during peak hours by aggregating power from devices many of us already have in our homes — such as smart thermostats, rooftop solar panels, home and electric vehicle batteries and electric heat pumps.

Managing strain on the grid with virtual power plants helps avoid blackouts, reduces reliance on gas powered plants and saves electricity customers money on their utility bills, including those not participating in a virtual power plant program.

One recent study predicted virtual power plants could save Californians up to $13.7 billion on electricity over the next five years. That is the kind of climate-forward and affordability-focused policy that California voters and global climate champions want.

But all three bills were doomed because investor-owned utilities like PG&E continue to work against local-scale electricity solutions like virtual power plants, and they know they can count on Newsom as an ally.

It’s time for Newsom to start treating climate like a winning issue here in California — not just on the international stage in the lead-up to the 2028 presidential race. Investing in solutions like virtual power plants creates jobs, lowers electricity bills and builds resilience to wildfires and floods.

Californians pay twice the national average for electricity and yet still endure frequent planned blackouts. We want solutions that work, protect our families and save money, and we want our governor to champion them.

Newsom is right to emphasize affordability as a pillar of climate progress, creating further contrast between himself and President Donald Trump. That’s good politics and good policy — but it’s also puzzling when his administration vetoes the most cost-effective clean energy solutions available today.

After his time in Brazil, Newsom needs more than rhetoric to cement his legacy as a true climate champion. In his final months as governor, he should advance policies that combat the climate crisis and economic relief to hardworking Californians. Here are two ways he can show the world how to tackle climate change while lowering the cost of living.

First, knock down state barriers to local, clean, affordable energy. Newsom must stop deferring to corporate utilities like PG&E and mobilize the state to support rooftop solar, virtual power plants and other clean, decentralized electricity solutions.

Second, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and make corporate polluters pay for climate disasters. California hands billions to the oil and gas industry while communities bear the costs of extreme weather and fossil fuel pollution. Making polluters pay their fair share would help finance the transition to a cleaner economy, improve public health and take the burden off taxpayers.

These solutions can be replicated around the world. And, thanks to Newsom’s strong showing in Brazil, the world will be watching.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/021820_Solar-Panels_AW_CM_03.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-25 10:00:23.083234

South Carolina Businesses To Save $40 Million

COLUMBIA, S.C. – Governor Henry McMaster and S.C. Department of Employment and Workforce (DEW) Executive Director William Floyd today announced that South Carolina’s unemployment insurance (UI) tax rates will decrease or remain the same for employers in 2026. Overall, UI tax costs next year are projected to be $40 million lower than in 2025.

""During every year of my administration, we have lowered or maintained UI business taxes, and 2026 will bring the largest reduction yet,"" said Governor Henry McMaster. ""South Carolina continues to attract jobs and investment because we focus on creating the most competitive and business-friendly climate in the country. These tax cuts give employers more room to hire, expand, and invest, which strengthens our economy and creates new opportunities for our people.""

UI tax rates have either decreased or remained the same for the last 12 consecutive years, reducing employer tax burdens by $355 million. The 2026 UI tax cut is the largest by percentage since 2011.

With a fully solvent and resilient UI Trust Fund balance of $1.8 billion, DEW has released the tax rates applicable to wages paid January 1 through December 31, 2026, ranging from 0.06% to 5.46% depending on an individual business’s experience with the UI system.

Some key information includes the following:

Any business that had no UI benefit charges from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2025, is assigned to tax class 1 and pays 0.06%.

New businesses with less than 12 months of accomplished liability will pay the new employer tax rate of 1.0%.

2026 rates are lower than last year for businesses in tax classes 2 through 19. The average savings for businesses in tax classes 2 through 19 is 34.7%.

“South Carolina has hit historic levels of people working, become fourth in the nation for real GDP growth, increased job and wage growth across many sectors this year, and has steadily grown our UI Trust Fund,” said DEW Executive Director William Floyd.

To determine tax rates each year, DEW conducts an extensive analysis of factors such as the economy, the current state of the UI Trust Fund, projected unemployment rates, and estimated benefit payments. Although tax rates for most classes are lower than their 2025 levels, individual businesses may still move between classes based on their unemployment claim activity. All businesses with charges against their accounts are provided a “charge statement” quarterly to review and have 30 days to protest any charges that they do not believe should be on their account. Tax rate notices will be mailed to businesses this week. However, employers can log into their State Unemployment Insurance Tax System (SUITS) account today to view their 2026 tax rate.

BJWSA preparing to activate two major system improvements

(Okatie, South Carolina) – November 20, 2025 -- Beaufort-Jasper Water & Sewer Authority (BJWSA) is about to activate two major infrastructure improvements with an eye toward expanding drinking water storage and treatment capacity: A new pump at the Purrysburg Water Treatment Plant and elevated storage tank at Buckwalter Parkway

“These projects are significant milestones toward meeting our current and future needs,” said Verna Arnette, BJWSA’s general manager. “The new 15-million-gallons per day (MGD) pump will distribute water treated at our recently expanded Purrysburg Water Treatment Plant. The elevated storage tank, located along Buckwalter Parkway will provide storage for 1.5-million-gallons of treated drinking water and stabilize pressure during times of high demand.”

The 15 MGD pump is part of a $60 million expansion of the Purrysburg Water Treatment plant capacity. This project doubled the amount of water the plant can treat from 15 to 30 million gallons of water per day. This pump is one of the largest at the plant with the ability to distribute 10,400 gallons of treated drinking water per minute. While the plant directly serves the BJWSA service area south of the Broad River, the project enhances supply for all BJWSA customers.

Construction of the elevated storage tank and associated transmission lines required an investment of more than $28 million. Work was completed several weeks ago, and it has been undergoing inspections and permitting. After Thanksgiving, it will be disinfected and placed into service.

Any hydraulic change in the distribution system has the potential to create discolored water caused by the disturbance of natural mineral sediment. However, crews are taking the following steps to reduce the likelihood of customer inconvenience. The high-service pump at Purrysburg will be tested this week with discharges into a nearby stormwater retention basin. When tests are complete, it will be placed into service. The elevated storage tank will be slowly filled and placed into service after December 8.

If customers notice discoloration, they should allow cold water to flow for a few minutes until it clears. If it does not run clear after 10 minutes, please call BJWSA’s customer service hotline at 843-987-9200 and crews can flush mains at nearby hydrants.

“While we support ‘no regrets’ policies, we note that this version of the Energy Master Plan contains the same fatal flaw as its predecessors.","The basics:

Murphy administration releases final 2024 Energy Master Plan after 22 months of development

EMP outlines ‘no-regrets’ strategies for clean energy, grid reliability & emissions targets

Plan includes major pushes on solar, wind, nuclear, EV adoption, energy affordability programs

Critics question costs, timing and electrification mandates as transition to new administration nears

As his administration enters its final stretch, Gov. Phil Murphy announced Nov. 24 the release of New Jersey’s 2024 Energy Master Plan.

As NJBIZ has reported extensively, the energy issue is front and center in the state. During the recent gubernatorial election between Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, the issue emerged at the heart of campaign ads, attacks, the debate and on the trail. This past June, New Jerseyans were hit with a nearly 20% bill increase. Sherrill has pledged a day one state of emergency on energy costs and a utility rate hike freeze as part of her energy policy.

The Murphy administration says the EMP, available here, provides a roadmap designed to guide future energy policy in the state.

Building on the 2019 EMP, the latest took nearly 22 months to develop. Consulting teams from Energy and Environmental Economics (E3), ILLUME Advising and BW Research prepared the report, incorporating the latest technologies, regulatory and market advancements.

“This report is the culmination of our no-regrets strategy to tackling the challenges of energy affordability, supply and demand, and climate change,” said Murphy. “I am proud of all that we’ve been able to achieve to make our energy sector cleaner and more efficient over the past eight years. This report’s recommendations will help guide energy policy to new heights in the future.”

‘No regrets’

At the core of the EMP is a “no-regrets” framework. The administration says these strategies provide immediate benefits while keeping future flexibility, ensuring New Jersey can adapt to technological innovations, market shifts or federal policy changes.

These strategies aim to advance the state’s statutory climate targets. Those include an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 under the Global Warming Response Act and 100% clean electricity sales by 2035.

Key strategies and initiatives include:

Emphasis on expanding solar, wind, advanced nuclear, green hydrogen and battery storage toward reducing electricity imports, increasing in-state generation, growing clean energy jobs, increasing resource diversity and supporting long-term cost stability

Expanding decarbonization and efficiency programs. The administration says these are essential for reducing emissions and electricity demand

Ensuring a reliable and modern grid to serve increasing loads and demand. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has implemented regulatory changes to speed up interconnection of distributed energy resources, improve transparency and support a more flexible, interactive grid

Continue to make strides in transportation electrification across multiple sectors. The administration points to progress made through various programs, such as Charge Up NJ and others. New Jersey is nearing its statutory goal of 330,000 light-duty electric vehicles by 2025, with over 260,000 EVs currently on the road. Additionally, more than 5,000 charging stations are deployed statewide

Calls for expanded bill assistance, time-of-use rate pilots and lowering upfront costs of energy efficiency, heat pumps and EVs for low- and moderate-income customers to expand affordability and environmental fairness

Continued engagement and coordination with PJM Interconnection and neighboring states to ensure grid reliability, affordability and accelerate clean energy integration

Major focus on innovation and workforce development. Current workforce initiatives – which the EMP says should continue – include:

Clean energy training hubs, apprenticeships and funding for overburdened communities, preparing for an estimated 14,300 to 42,400 net new workers needed in the state’s broader energy economy, primarily in the green economy, between 2022 and 2035

Timing

Of course, critics of the Murphy administration’s energy policy have regularly voiced their displeasure with 2019 EMP. They site its all-in bets on renewables as well as lofty, mandated electrification goals, which detractors don’t believe the state had the infrastructure and capacity for.

Senate Republican Leader Anthony Bucco, R-25th District, released a statement about the plan, particularly questioning the timing.

“Timing is everything, and it’s concerning that Gov. Murphy has chosen to officially release his 2024 Energy Master Plan less than 60 days before the end of his administration,” said Bucco. “Major policy decisions of this magnitude will shape New Jersey’s future for decades, and the next administration and incoming Legislature deserve a real voice in determining the direction of our state’s energy strategy.”

‘Unrealistic mandates’

Bucco says what continues to be missing from the plan is transparency.

“We still don’t have a clear picture of what this will cost New Jersey families, businesses and government entities,” said Bucco. “Utility customers have already endured steep rate increases, and they deserve to know how much more they will be asked to pay. Doubling down on full electrification by 2035 will only make the state’s energy challenges worse and push our utility rates even higher.

“These unrealistic mandates will only serve to further strain our grid, increase costs, and undermine reliability.”

Bucco recommended that Murphy and Sherrill follow Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s lead and withdraw from Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Ciattarelli had also supported exiting RGGI on the trail. Additionally, Bucco pushed consideration of Republican’s Senate Bill 4765. The legislation would suspends sales and use tax and societal benefits charges on electric and gas bills for one year from, Jan. 1, 2026 to Dec. 31, 2026.

“New Jersey should be pursuing commonsense, balanced energy solutions that protect both our environment and household budgets – not doubling down on policies that make life more expensive,” said Bucco. “As we prepare for a new administration, I look forward to pursuing these common sense solutions that lower electricity cost, strengthen our energy reliability, and make New Jersey affordable for families, seniors, and small businesses.”

Senate Democrats had no comment about the new EMP. Sherrill transition did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

‘Fatal flaw’

Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association (NJBIA), released a statement on behalf of the organization.

“We appreciate the Murphy administration providing a status report of its energy policies before we close the book on the last eight years,” said Cantor. “While we support ‘no regrets’ policies, we note that this version of the Energy Master Plan contains the same fatal flaw as its predecessors. It establishes artificial deadlines for decarbonization that has led to the policy choices that have contributed to driving up the price of energy.”

Cantor said that merely repeating the term – affordability, which he points out the report does 60 times – does not make it more affordable.

“We look forward to working with the incoming Sherill administration to implement energy policies that truly focus on affordability, reliability, and technological advancement. Working together, we can achieve both our energy and decarbonization goals in a way that works for all the citizens and business in New Jersey.”

This broad patent covers technology that combines lithium extraction, anode production and battery manufacturing. Pure Lithium’s Brine to Battery™ is a registered trademark in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, planting a strong base of intellectual property in the region.

“The technology is particularly relevant to Saudi Arabia because it is one of the places in the world with lithium-containing brines, and even has an abundance of vanadium, which is used in our second-generation battery,” said Founder, Chairman and CEO Emilie Bodoin. “In order to displace today’s lithium-ion battery, our vision is to create global battery hubs with closed loop supply chains, not just in the U.S., but in the many places in the world where the materials are co-located. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of these perfect fits, and our visions are clearly aligned.”

Pure Lithium received a foundational U.S. patent for “Lithium Metal and Lithium Battery” in February 2023, with Emilie Bodoin listed as the sole inventor. Pure Lithium has strategically built an intellectual property powerhouse, and now has more than 128 patents and patent applications, and a trademark registered in numerous countries.

Saudi Arabia’s Energy Capital Group became a Pure Lithium investor in 2023, saying the deployment of the company’s technology “could provide Saudi Arabia with the ability to enter the battery manufacturing space with the competitive edge of having unprecedented supply chain security.”

Pure Lithium has invented a lithium metal battery that is more powerful, lighter and less expensive to produce than today’s lithium-ion battery. The battery uses no graphite, nickel, cobalt or manganese, ending reliance on China for battery materials, and the principal elements tend to be located close together geographically unlike today’s complex lithium-ion battery supply chain.

Automated systems for operational continuity A defining feature of the solar roof is its automated retractability.","A remarkable foldable solar roof, which was constructed by dhp Technology, is transforming a large operational area into a dual-purpose asset.

For manufacturing executives, it is an example of how large-scale photovoltaic (PV) generation can be deployed over existing facilities such as storage yards, car parks or assembly areas without interrupting day-to-day business. This approach to land use could be an important factor for industrial sites where space is at a premium.

Constructed as a canopy above the ARA Thunersee Wastewater Treatment Plant in Uetendorf, the installation provides a blueprint for integrating renewable energy into sensitive or high-traffic environments. It is a powerful example of how industrial sectors can contribute to decarbonisation targets without needing to acquire new land for solar farms.

The ability to build above existing infrastructure rather than expanding outwards is a compelling proposition for manufacturing hubs in land-constrained regions.

Integrating solar generation in live manufacturing environments

One of the main challenges for on-site solar generation in manufacturing is the need to maintain constant access to the ground below.

The Uetendorf project is positioned over wastewater treatment basins, which require unobstructed access for maintenance and inspection, much like a factory yard requires access for lorries, forklifts and personnel. The HORIZON system from dhp Technology addresses this by using a cable-supported structure.

The design creates wide 20-metre spans with a roof height of up to seven metres. This ensures that operational workflows on the ground are not impeded. The system’s ability to fully retract means that access is never compromised.

For a manufacturing plant, this could mean deploying a solar array over a logistics yard while still allowing for the free movement of vehicles and goods. This dual-use capability turns what is normally just operational space into a source of clean energy.

Scalable energy output and financial viability

The foldable solar roof in Switzerland covers 20,000 square metres and has an installed capacity of 3,000 kilowatt peak (3 MWp). Its projected annual output of 3 to 3.4 gigawatt hours (GWh) is enough energy to supply approximately 700 homes.

For a large manufacturing facility, a system of this scale could considerably reduce reliance on purchased electricity helping to insulate the business from volatile energy markets.

This level of on-site generation directly supports long-term sustainability commitments and can lead to considerable cost savings. The design of the HORIZON system is also materially efficient. According to dhp Technology, the lightweight cable-supported structure uses around 50% less material than conventional rigid solar installations of a similar size.

This reduction in materials could not only lower the initial capital investment but also lessen the overall environmental footprint of the installation.

Automated systems for operational continuity

A defining feature of the solar roof is its automated retractability. Using technology inspired by cable cars, the non-glass PV modules are suspended from high-tension cables and can be automatically folded away into a protected storage position.

This mechanism is activated during severe weather like high winds or heavy snow, which reduces structural stress and protects the asset from damage.

This automated protection ensures the longevity of the system and simplifies its engineering requirements. For a manufacturer, the key benefit is operational continuity.

The roof can generate power under normal conditions but be retracted to prevent damage during a storm, ensuring the safety of the site and the asset itself. The system’s pre-assembled support trusses also simplify installation, reducing the complexity and time needed for on-site construction and improving safety.

This combination of automated protection and streamlined installation makes the technology a practical consideration for active industrial environments.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/1774edf428b97f03ca90608cb990194b:f43b6bed84244426db820d1ee4766db9/ara-thunersee-5.png.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 09:01:07.351871

“We have a national power grid, but each region makes its own projections of likely demand,” Purtilo explained.","In July, Reuters reported that America’s largest power grid was under strain as data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots increasingly consume power faster than new plants could be built. Within PJM Interconnection’s grid, which covers 13 states from Illinois to Tennessee, Virginia to New Jersey, there were more data centers than anywhere else in the world.

It was expected to spike energy costs by up to 20%.

According to a report from NPR, citing data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the typical data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the most significant data centers now under development will consume 20 times more. In addition, these data centers require billions of gallons of water to keep the hardware cool.

“Training large models requires immense computational power delivered by advanced servers that pack in powerful computer chips such as GPUs,” explains Archit Lohokare, cybersecurity advisor and general manager of the security business at CyberArk.

“These servers and components, that can perform trillions of calculations per second, require many times as much energy as traditional servers to run,” Lohokare told ClearanceJobs. “A single AI-enhanced internet query can use roughly 10 times the electricity of a conventional search, so when you scale that to billions of queries, the impact on the grid becomes very real. In the U.S., data centers used an estimated 183TWh of electricity in 2024, about 4% of all power, and it is expected that this could more than double by 2030 as workloads expand.”

Strain in Key Areas

The states most impacted by the surge in data centers are, not surprisingly, those with open land and access to reliable power. A new study by the mineral rights brokerage firm Texas Royalty Brokers measured AI energy demand across America and reported that Indiana dedicates more electricity to AI than any other state, with its data centers consuming nearly half of the state’s energy output.

A single AI facility in Wisconsin was also found to use a quarter of the Badger State’s electricity.

Texas, which has a massive power grid, now hosts the most AI facilities, with 17 clusters that use 15% of the state’s power generation.

The AI and data center boom will present challenges, at least regionally, Dr. Jim Purtilo, associate professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, told ClearanceJobs.

“We have a national power grid, but each region makes its own projections of likely demand,” Purtilo explained. “They look years ahead to ensure they are building out enough capacity, and also to service or upgrade infrastructure, since there is not much point to new generation if the lines can’t get power to where it is used. Anyone who lives in hurricane country knows issues of the latter.”

However, the dramatic shifts in immigration patterns in recent years impacted the housing market, which in turn broke projections of demand to power those homes.

“As a result, some regions are operating more on the edge than others,” Purtilo added. “When you add high-demand data and AI centers to the mix, then there is a real danger that demand will outstrip capacity. This reality is already reflected in regionally increasing energy costs.”

However, he said we should not necessarily extrapolate demand by drawing a straight line pointing up, even as many entrepreneurs do when they invite investors to buy into their firms that capitalize on expansion.

“My guess is that the demand picture will become more nuanced,” Purtilo continued. “Computer scientists have done an amazing job with new AI technology, but mostly these are based on brute force techniques, hence the demand for so much computation. It was all about being the first with the most. Now forward-thinking scientists are working hard on ‘frugal AI,’ which is to say, finding AI techniques that don’t need the heavy computations.”

May Not Bring A Lot of Jobs

The issue in the short term is where the AI data centers are being built. The centers require large buildings yet employ a relatively small workforce. Unlike a factory that can provide jobs for hundreds of individuals, such facilities employ anywhere from a couple of dozen to around 100 full-time staff for operations, including technicians, engineers, and security personnel. While construction can temporarily involve thousands of workers, the permanent, on-site staff is relatively small for the massive size of the facilities.

At the same time, data centers require space, and unless there is an old shopping mall or shuttered factory, builders look to rural rather than urban options. This is done for other reasons as well.

“While putting data centers in open rural areas avoids building huge substations next to neighborhoods, many rural grids just aren’t designed for multi-hundred-megawatt loads,” warned Lohokare. “Without targeted upgrades, they risk congestion and higher local costs – which is why groups like the Electric Power Research Institute and World Resources Institute emphasize careful regional planning so AI growth doesn’t just shift today’s grid problems onto smaller communities.”

This is the latest disruption to some communities. It should be remembered that electricity to homes in cities and urban centers arrived long before it reached rural communities. It was only following the establishment of the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) in 1935 that efforts began, and it took until the early 1960s for it to be largely completed.

“Rural communities will indeed benefit to some extent from this trend – there will be some economic benefits from increased tax revenues, improved infrastructure and indirect jobs, such as services, construction, local supply chain; in addition to some long-term jobs in operating the data centers themselves,” added Lohokare.

Lessons From History

AI is still in its infancy, and the technology will undoubtedly evolve. What that means is still only coming into focus.

“A hundred years ago, access to telephone technology was spreading fast around the country, and scientists extrapolated to predict that inside a few decades, half the population would need to be employed as telephone operators to route the calls of the other half of the population,” said Purtilo.

“Ultimately, that became true! But not the way people projected,” Purtilo added. “It became true because of the further advance of automatic switching in calls. Each user became their own operator by dialing for themselves. In much the same way, AI will continue to spread rampantly, but how we do it will look very different in just a few years. The technology will grow into the power capacity we will have.”",https://news.clearancejobs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1150x732-100.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:04:23.214562

BAIROIL—The remote dirt road through dusty fields of sagebrush that John Cash drove along in June seemed to pass little of economic value. But his car was, in fact, rattling towards the top-producing uranium mine in Wyoming.

In 2022, the Lost Creek Mine became the first of several such sites across the West to restart operations as the U.S. scrambles to reestablish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel.

Cash, the CEO of UR Energy, which operates the Lost Creek Mine, believes more mines will come online in the years ahead.

“This [area] is loaded with uranium,” he said amid the vast, arid expanse of Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin. “I promise you right now, if I drilled a hole right here, we would hit uranium.”

Newly revived mines are also humming in Texas and Arizona, their owners hopeful that a boom in demand lies ahead. Ten uranium mines operate in the country today, up from three in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Company announcements and public records show dozens of others on standby for reopening or queued up for permitting in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with at least four currently fast-tracked for approval under recent executive orders.

“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. “We’ve been off the playing field for decades on some of this stuff.”

For more than a generation, many of these sites sat dormant, stifled by a cheaper imported supply and modest demand from a stagnant nuclear power sector. However, uranium markets have recently reawakened: Spot prices doubled between 2022 and 2024, driven by global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tension and lofty expectations for a renaissance of American atomic power.

Lately, a buzzing landscape of nuclear startups has stirred excitement with announcements of ambitious plans for advanced reactors to power artificial intelligence and other heavy industries across the country. But almost all of these companies are waiting for the U.S. to rebuild a nuclear fuel supply chain before they can even power up their prototype units.

“Expectations for uranium demand have been growing,” said William Freebairn, an associate editorial director at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But this kind of demand is slow to show up.”

Investor appetite for uranium started to increase around 2022, he said, “as climate concerns became more prominent.” Uranium is processed and enriched into nuclear fuel that provides abundant energy without carbon emissions, although it poses other significant health and safety risks.

Presidential administrations since Barack Obama’s have pushed to increase domestic production of uranium fuel to supply the national nuclear sector, but that goal remains years away. President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders this year to streamline permitting, expedite environmental reviews and impose tariffs on imports that compete with American products.

Despite the recent activity, the U.S. still has a long way to go before it could even come close to meeting its nuclear needs with uranium from domestic mines, Freebairn said.

Unlike pit mines, which scrape away acres of earth, most modern uranium extraction projects drill hundreds of wells, inject them with solvents and suck up the mineral slurry they create. This method has a much lighter impact on the surface but can contaminate or deplete freshwater aquifers if improperly managed.

In Wyoming, several hundred wells churn out a modest 28,000 pounds of uranium oxide per month at the Lost Creek mine. The mine is licensed to produce more than 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide concentrate annually, according to UR Energy, but uranium miners are still waiting for the development of a domestic nuclear supply chain before ramping up production.

Supply chain bottleneck

For now, American uranium production remains a dribble. Despite recent steep increases, total output in 2024 was less than 2% of the country’s peak production in 1981. The U.S. lacks the infrastructure to transform uranium oxide concentrate, known in the industry as “yellowcake,” into the uranium hexafluoride gas used for enrichment. About 99% of the feedstock consumed by U.S. power plants is imported, and much of that uranium is enriched in Russia, despite the prohibition on importing Russian uranium that then-President Joe Biden signed in May 2024. The ban doesn’t fully go into effect until 2028.

“Uranium mining, uranium processing and uranium enrichment have all largely been offshored because they could do it cheaper,” said Rusty Towell, director of the Nuclear Energy Experimental Testing Laboratory at Abilene Christian University. “That whole supply chain was weakened.”

In the U.S., just one commercial plant converts uranium into the gaseous form required for enrichment and only one commercial plant enriches that gas into nuclear fuel at the scale required to fuel power plants. No facility can produce significant volumes of the higher-grade fuel used by new reactor designs — High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium, or HALEU. That also comes primarily from Russia, though the Department of Energy has posted billions in grant funding for private-sector enrichment projects in the U.S.

“The U.S. [government] is moving very fast on this,” said James Walker, CEO of a startup called Nano Nuclear Energy and a former nuclear engineer at the U.K. Ministry of Defense. “Now the pressure is on everybody to ramp up as fast as they can.”

A whole cluster of advanced nuclear startups like Nano eagerly awaits the availability of American HALEU to begin testing their reactors, and they’ll purchase the new enrichment facilities’ product as soon as it becomes available, Walker said.

However, even a booming domestic market for nuclear fuel doesn’t guarantee that American uranium miners will supply the needed raw material. New enrichment projects could continue to import uranium mined overseas — but government policies are making that harder, including with the Biden administration’s ban on imports of Russian uranium.

“We are making investments to build out a secure nuclear fuel supply chain here in the United States,” the announcement of that ban stated.

This year, Trump imposed tariffs on imports from 70 countries, including the top uranium producers: Kazakhstan, Canada and Namibia.

“As long as we’re keeping that foreign uranium from coming in, then I think there is hope for domestic production,” said Brent Elliott, a geologist with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas. But if “we can get it cheaper somewhere else, then that will more likely be the case.”

A flurry of new mines

In Wyoming, home to the nation’s richest known uranium deposits, three other companies have recently joined UR Energy in ramping up operations. To the south, in far western Colorado, Canadian firm Anfield Energy announced plans in August to begin exploratory drilling at an abandoned, 2000-acre uranium pit mine.

In Utah, Anfield’s Velvet-Wood project received an expedited environmental review that lasted just two weeks due to a March executive order from the White House.

“This approval marks a turning point,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release at the time. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries.”

The reviews of several mines in western New Mexico were also fast-tracked and are expected to conclude in late 2027. They include the Crownpoint-Church Rock and La Jara Mesa projects by Australian miner Laramide Resources, as well as Energy Fuels’ Roca Honda project in the Cibola National Forest.

On federal lands, where many of the reopened mines are located, digs for minerals are still governed by the Mining Act of 1872. Originally passed to draw settlers to the West, it declares all mineral deposits “free and open to exploration and purchase.” The law has enabled some mines to open in areas that are culturally important to tribes, critical habitat for vulnerable species or revered for recreational and scenic values, often over local opposition.

Some of the fast-tracked New Mexico mines border the lands of the Acoma and Laguna pueblos. In the nearby Navajo Nation, the new activity has sparked concern.

The Navajo Nation “continues to be affected — not only from abandoned uranium mines and mill sites — but also from other contaminants,” said Perry Charley, chair of the Diné Uranium Remediation Advisory Commission, at a public meeting in August in Shiprock, New Mexico.

From 1944 to 1986, mining activities left more than 500 abandoned mines and an enormous amount of uranium waste in various regions of Navajo land.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies of the Navajo Nation have shown widespread groundwater contamination by uranium, as well as other elements released by the mining process, including arsenic, vanadium, manganese and lithium.

“Though uranium mining ceased on the Navajo Nation in 1986, the contamination left from these operations still represents a significant danger,” said a study from 2019.

Recent studies have linked proximity to abandoned uranium mines with increased risks of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases on the Navajo Nation. Uranium concentrations in urine samples of Navajo women are almost three times higher than the national median and are associated with significantly increased risks of preterm births, according to studies in 2020 and 2023.

Navajo people’s cancer diagnosis rate is 6.3 times higher for gallbladder cancer, 3.2 times higher for stomach cancer, 1.9 times higher for kidney cancer and 1.8 times higher for liver cancer than white populations in New Mexico and Arizona, according to a 2023 report from the Navajo Epidemiology Center.

On the eastern edge of Navajo land, at the Church Rock site, a dam failure in 1979 released 94 million gallons of waste fluids into the Rio Puerco, the largest radioactive material spill in U.S. history. Church Rock is among the sites currently undergoing expedited environmental review to resume production.

“These communities are still trying to clean up from the last time this happened,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit advocating for protection of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau. “For years, tribes have been reassured that the problems of the past are just that — problems of the past — and that now we have environmental laws that are supposedly protecting them.”

At the Navajo reservation’s western edge, uranium production began last year at the Pinyon Plain Mine, nestled among pinyon pine trees in the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim in Arizona.

The mine operator, Energy Fuels, began trucking its uranium product through Navajo territory in July 2024, but was forced to stop after the tribal government issued an order banning unauthorized transport of radioactive material.

“Anyone bringing those substances onto the Nation should undertake that activity with respect and sensitivity to the psychological impact to our people, as well as the trauma of uranium development that our community continues to live with every day,” former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch said in a statement at the time.

Later, the tribal government and Energy Fuels negotiated an agreement to resume transport of uranium from the Pinyon Plain Mine across the Navajo lands.

“Energy Fuels is pursuing an aggressive plan to quickly increase short-term U.S. uranium supply,” company CEO Mark Chalmers said in a press release this year announcing record production at Pinyon Plain.

Energy Fuels did not respond to requests for comment. The company has a long list of mines it’s working to bring back online across Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to public announcements.

Groundwater concerns

Permitted in 1986, the 14-acre Pinyon Plain Mine sat dormant for decades, like hundreds of other sites in the country, waiting for uranium prices to rebound. When they did, the U.S. Forest Service cleared it to begin operations for the first time last year, although it last cleared federal environmental review almost 40 years ago. The decision prompted protests from local tribes, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes.

“We must protect the water supplies,” Mayes said in an August 2024 statement calling for reevaluation of the mine. “The risks are too great to ignore.”

The site contains a single mine shaft extending 1,470 feet down to the uranium deposits, and the company removed millions of gallons of groundwater to access the ore. The mine and others like it pose threats to the region’s network of interconnected aquifers that stretches across the Grand Canyon region, according to research published last year by Karl Karlstrom and Laura Crossey, Emeritus professors of earth science at the University of New Mexico.

“Energy Fuels doesn’t know how much their mining is contaminating the deep aquifer, and USGS doesn’t know, and we don’t know,” Karlstrom said. “Caution is needed.”

In an interview, both researchers said the Pinyon Plain mining plan assumes that two underlying formations holding water, the upper Coconino aquifer and the lower Redwall-Mauv aquifer, aren’t connected. But ample regional science shows that’s not true, they said; water moves between them.

The Redwall-Mauv aquifer feeds springs across the region, some of which provide drinking water for the Havasupai Tribe.

“Current well data are insufficient to rule out a connection between the two aquifers,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a review of the mine following Karlstrom and Crossey’s study. But the agency noted that USGS data from the mine’s well sites show elevated levels of uranium and arsenic contamination, and that it is unclear how or if it will spread.

“The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from operations at the Pinyon Plain Mine site cannot be assessed fully without additional investigations,” the EPA review concluded.

The uranium mining revival has churned up similar concerns in the savannah of South Texas. Encore Energy, based in the Gulf Coast city of Corpus Christi, started production at its Rosita site in November 2023 and its Alta Mesa site in June 2024. In August, it acquired 5,900 more acres adjacent to Alta Mesa, where it plans to begin drilling in October. Another Corpus Christi-based company, Uranium Energy Corp., expects to start mining at its South Texas sites in early 2026.

One rural groundwater conservation district is fighting the renewal of an old, unused mining permit UEC holds for a site in Goliad County.

“We are extremely concerned that UEC’s uranium mining activities will lead to groundwater contamination,” said a request for a hearing on the mine permits filed by the district with Texas’ environmental regulator late last year.

Faultlines and abandoned oil wells connect the mining area to freshwater aquifers, the district claims. Some 30 households, a church and about 400 cattle drink from wells in the area surrounding the mine. Groundwater levels there dropped 15 feet between 2000 and 2022, the district said.

The Goliad site will use about 130 million gallons per year, according to Art Dohmann, vice president of the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District. But mining is exempt from groundwater permitting requirements under Texas law, he said.

“This may cause more wells in the area to go dry,” the district wrote in comments to the state.

In August, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality voted unanimously to grant the district’s request for a hearing on the permit. UEC did not respond to requests for comment.

Separate state permits authorize UEC to inject up to 105 million gallons of mining wastewater underground for disposal every year at its Goliad site. UEC has four other projects under development in South Texas.

The company, which calls itself “America’s largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium,” also owns sites in New Mexico and Wyoming, where its Christensen Ranch mine began production last summer and its Sweetwater Uranium Complex was selected in August for the fast-tracked approval authorized by President Trump’s executive order.

UEC calls Sweetwater “the largest uranium complex in the U.S.” It encompasses 20,000 acres of exploration and mining rights in Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, and sits only a few miles from UR Energy’s Lost Creek Mine, where Cash, UR Energy’s CEO, was surveying his company’s project.

Before UEC can even develop the site, the expedited review is expected to take 18 months, according to a federal permitting tracker.

Drilling uranium

On a hot morning in June, three men and a 25-foot-tall winch pulled piping from the ground at the Lost Creek mine in Wyoming. They had just completed a new uranium well.

Cash, a trim man with brown hair lightly graying on the sides, inspected a slab of wood containing samples of wet earth taken every five feet down the well. A chunk he scooped up was a deep green, indicating it probably contained uranium.

“For a geologist, it’s like reading a book,” said Cash, who has a master’s degree in geology and geophysics from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Lost Creek extracts uranium using in-situ recovery — ISR mining — a process pioneered in Wyoming in the 1960s. Over the eons, water carried uranium off the granite mountains surrounding the Great Divide Basin, burying it in the sandstone. Water is now used to draw it back out. The company drills wells patterned like the five sides of dice and then injects a leachate — water, oxygen, CO2 and occasionally soda ash at UR-Energy’s project, according to Cash — into the exterior four shafts. When that stew is pumped back to the surface through the center pipe, it’s full of uranium.

Wells’ surface impacts bother Cash, he said, looking out over the site. “I wish we could do this with less disturbance.”

But if this were an open-pit mine, a crater would displace the vegetation on the surface and “this would all be gone in perpetuity,” he added. Instead, the company will replant native sagebrush and grasses, Cash said.

Hundreds of wells surrounded the site’s processing facility — a concrete and steel warehouse where employees wearing radiation-monitoring badges oversee chemical processes that turn uranium-filled slurry into yellowcake, the base ingredient of nuclear fuel.

Water that isn’t reused, about 21,600 gallons a day, according to Cash, is treated and disposed of underground.

Lost Creek has detected groundwater contaminated by what the company injects — moving “where it shouldn’t move” — four or five times since 2013, Cash said. If left alone, it could spread to freshwater sources. This is “exceedingly rare,” and each time it has happened, UR Energy has successfully prevented an escape, he said.

Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins. He chaffed at the fact that UR Energy was required to install and maintain a full-blown weather station at Lost Creek, and wondered why his company had to take groundwater that was already undrinkable and make it slightly cleaner, but still unpotable, before disposal.

“We need to be protective,” he said. “But we don’t need to be hyper-protective.”

Cash left Lost Creek for another UR Energy project, which would revive the Shirley Basin mine some 80 miles east at the foot of the Laramie Range. On his way that June day, he passed another potential mine, the Lost Soldier project, a claim he isn’t sure the company will ever develop.

“There’s a lot more work we need to do,” Cash said.

Executive summary

Climate change threatens to increase the risk of extinction of rare wildlife species and reduce the populations of many hunted wildlife species in Michigan. To reduce the threat of climate change to Michigan wildlife species, the state has set ambitious renewable energy targets, and wind energy will be an important component of Michigan’s clean energy future. Despite its inherent benefits, wind energy development in Michigan has the potential to harm some species of wildlife, especially bats and birds, if care is not taken to minimize adverse impacts. Other best management practice (BMP) documents for wind energy and wildlife exist, but they lack a Michigan perspective and framework for weighing the relative context-specific benefits of various practices. This set of BMPs adds specificity to Michigan’s unique geography and relevant wildlife species. This set of BMPs will be updated periodically as more information becomes available. We divided our recommendations into two sets: true BMPs, which broadly represent practices in industry, and “additional considerations,” which are generally applicable but might be applied differently in different regions, contexts, or circumstances.

Best Management Practices:

Consultation

Site evaluation, including a desktop environmental review for known locations of state or federally threatened or endangered species

In high-risk hibernacula zones (Figure 1), avoid siting turbines

In medium-risk hibernacula zones (Figure 1), use feathering to avoid risk of take. Avoidance can be through smart curtailment or feathering turbine blades below cut-in speeds > 6.9 m/s in seasons, weather, and times of day when bats are flying (Table 1)

In low-risk hibernacula zones (i.e., statewide; Figure 1), use feathering to reduce risk of take. Reduction can be through smart curtailment or feathering turbine blades below cut-in speeds of at least 5 m/s in seasons, in weather, and times of day when bats are flying (Table 1)

Site wind turbines at least 2 miles from state and federal public lands managed as wildlife refuges or managed waterfowl hunting areas (Figure 2)

Additional Considerations:

Site wind energy facilities at least 3 miles from Great Lakes shoreline

Do not site individual turbines within 0.5 miles of known bald eagle nests

Site in non-forested landscapes

Site at least 1 mile from bird conservation areas

Conduct post-construction bird/bat monitoring

Avoid siting individual turbines near (<200 m) local wildlife attractants, such as wetlands or woodlots

Build all meteorological towers as free-standing towers or install bird diverters if guyed meteorological towers are constructed

Use flashing tower lights

Use security lights that are motion-sensor and down-shielded

Pilot and test emerging deterrence technologies

Introduction

The Michigan DNR recognizes that climate change and land use change are the primary threats to wildlife in Michigan, now and for the foreseeable future. We also recognize that energy policy to address the root causes of climate change will require land use change. Wildlife are seemingly caught in a no-win situation. However, many studies (e.g., Arnett et al. 2013, Hayes et al. 2019, Friedenberg and Frick 2021) have shown that changes in how renewable energy is constructed and operated can minimize or eliminate the threats to wildlife from land use change, which changes the equation from a no-win situation to a win-win situation. Our intent in developing this set of BMPs is to encourage voluntary conservation practices in the wind energy development sector for both rare and common wildlife in Michigan.

Best practices represent a different threshold than laws and regulations; BMPs tend to be practices that may not be appropriate in the same way in all cases. This is one reason that consultation with state or federal wildlife biologists can be useful; each potential development is unique. We originally organized BMPs by priority, because not all practices have the same level of effect. However, this made it difficult to distinguish between best practices and practices to consider in certain contexts or in trade-offs with other practices. For that reason, we have simplified the list of best practices and included a section of “additional considerations,” which might be case- or site-specific. A secondary intent of this set of BMPs is to highlight some ways in which Michigan regulations regarding wind energy differ from those of other states, especially regarding concentrations of bat hibernacula in abandoned mines and state laws that protect state-listed threatened and endangered species. The regulatory environment for wind energy development in Michigan has been and continues to be dynamic. We have attempted to clearly distinguish in this document best practices, which are voluntary, from regulations, which are not voluntary.

The Roles of State and Federal Wildlife Agencies

Federal and state wildlife agencies are distinct entities. They have their own jurisdictions and enforce their own laws through different sets of regulations and policies. Wind energy developers and operators are responsible for following both sets of regulations. Michigan’s list of endangered species, for instance, has more than 400 species, and unlike the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), Michigan’s state law protects plants and animals equally. Within their borders, state wildlife agencies have jurisdiction over wildlife, which are managed in trust for the state’s citizens. Those jurisdictions vary from state to state. WLD encourages wind energy developers and operators to become familiar with state wildlife laws and regulations, including Michigan’s endangered species law and Wildlife Conservation Order. Communication with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) consistent with recommendations made in the Communication Framework for Wind Energy Project Proponents and State Fish and Wildlife Agencies jointly published by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the American Clean Power Association is one way to become familiar with our state laws, native species, and their habitats.

Michigan’s Climate Change Goals

Climate change is a major threat to wildlife and their habitats in Michigan, and the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation is increasing the severity of that threat (Sovacool 2012). Hoving et al. (2013) estimated that 54% of 400 Michigan wildlife species were vulnerable to climate change, including 61% of rare species and 17% of game species. Thus, the transition to renewable energy sources and away from energy sources that perpetuate and worsen climate change is an important wildlife conservation strategy. That said, the benefits of renewable energy also come with costs. Renewable energy in the wrong place or implemented in the wrong way can cause considerable harm to wildlife.

Michigan has set an ambitious goal for transitioning from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable energy with economy-wide clean energy by 2040. Wind energy will continue to be a major part of the new energy mix. In Michigan, the costs per energy generated for wind and solar are similar. Unlike solar energy facilities, most of the land area within a wind energy facility is not fenced; agricultural and other rural land uses, including hunting and trapping, can usually continue to occur under the turbines.

Wildlife that Benefits Most from Wind BMPs

The two taxa that are most impacted by wind energy development are birds and bats (Allison et al. 2019). Among both groups, risk tends to be greatest during fall and spring migration, but impacts can occur in any season. Birds can be impacted directly by mortality caused by wind energy developments or indirectly through loss of open grassland habitat without trees or structures that some bird species need to successfully reproduce (Conkling et al. 2022). Birds tend to strike any tall structures, and the movement of the wind turbine blades seems to add little if any risk (Maio et al. 2019). Wind energy turbines, communication towers, and tall buildings of a similar height are thus a direct mortality risk to birds in the same way.

Wind energy facilities can also cause some species of birds to avoid breeding in an area (Shaffer and Buhl 2016). Many grassland bird species are already in decline because so few suitable open fields remain on the landscape. This is especially true in Michigan, where several species of grassland nesting birds are on the state threatened and endangered species list.

Bat interactions with wind facilities are very different. Bat fatality rates are generally higher and more variable than bird fatality rates (AWWI 2021), and bat activity and behavior patterns in response to wind facilities suggest that at least some species of bats are attracted to wind turbines (Guest et al. 2022). No species appear to avoid areas with wind facilities, and in the northern hemisphere, peak wind mortality coincides with the fall migration and mating seasons of most species (AWWI 2021). The rotation of turbine blades poses the primary risk to bats, as evidence suggests bats (unlike birds) rarely collide with nonmoving blades or stationary turbine components (Horn et al. 2008, Cryan and Barclay 2014). Another important difference between bat and bird impacts is that bats breed very slowly; thus bat populations can be sent into decline more easily than most bird populations.

Several sets of best management practices or guidance documents now exist to inform wind energy development relative to wildlife impacts. What is still needed is guidance that is specific to Michigan’s unique geography and the distribution of wildlife in this state. Another need is a framework for prioritizing or combining various best management practices based on context-specific factors and impact potential. Finally, there is a need for Michigan-specific siting guidance that developers can use in the earliest phases of development, before significant resources have been invested in a given potential project area.

Intent in Developing Wind and Wildlife BMPs

Our objectives in developing these BMPs for wind energy and Michigan wildlife are to:

Encourage responsible wind energy development in Michigan

Reduce harm to wildlife in Michigan from wind energy development

Encourage cooperation and consultation between all partners involved in wind energy developments beyond the minimum regulatory requirements surrounding wildlife entrapment and endangered species.

These BMPs are intended to be used primarily by wind energy developers, operators, and their consultants to incorporate wildlife conservation values into projects. WLD recognizes that these audiences are attempting to optimize across many values, including energy generation and revenue, local community needs and interests, and other environmental considerations. Our goal in developing these BMPs is to provide information that will help developers prioritize voluntary measures to minimize adverse impacts to Michigan wildlife and provide a framework by which developers can highlight the beneficial practices they are voluntarily implementing. We also recognize that these BMPs will be used by many others with an interest in wind energy development or wildlife conservation, including wildlife advocates, local governments, and researchers.

Wind energy and bats

All Michigan bat species are susceptible to injury and death associated with wind energy facilities. Estimated bat fatality rates at wind facilities in the Midwest are variable but high in comparison with other regions of the U.S. and Canada, ranging from 0.4 to 32 bats per megawatt annually (Arnett et al. 2008, Hein et al. 2013, AWWI 2018, AWWI 2020). The median bat fatality rate among studies contained in the American Wind Wildlife Information Center for the Midwest was 8.4 bats per MW per year (AWWI 2020a, as reported in AWWI 2021). Bats are relatively long-lived, with some individuals living 30 years or more in the wild, and they have extremely low reproductive rates (Barclay and Harder 2003, Brunet-Rossinni and Austad 2004). As such, high levels of adult mortality can have significant effects on the long-term sustainability of local populations (Schorcht et al. 2009). In this, bats are similar to much larger mammals that live relatively long lifespans and reproduce slowly, such as elephants and primates. Relatively small increases in adult mortality rates can cause population declines.

Although recent population declines in cave hibernating bats are primarily due to the fungal disease white-nose syndrome (WNS), wind related fatality has been reported for all five species of bats listed as state threatened or endangered in Michigan: Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), northern long-eared bat (M. septentrionalis), tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus), little brown bat (M. lucifugus), and evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis). In addition to their state protected status, the Indiana bat and northern long-eared bat are also federally endangered, the tricolored bat is proposed for listing as federally endangered (as of December 2024), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is conducting a discretionary status review to determine if listing the little brown bat as endangered or threatened is warranted.

The USFWS species status assessment (SSA) reports for the northern long-eared bat (USFWS 2022; Docket FWS-R3-ES-2021-0140) and tricolored bat (USFWS 2021; Docket FWS-R5-ES-2021-0163) suggest that the impact of wind related mortality is discernible in the ongoing decline of both species. Based on data from Wiens et al. (2022) comparing a no wind energy baseline scenario to current and future wind energy development scenarios, projected abundance of northern long-eared bats decreases 24–33% by 2030 under the current scenario and up to 83% by 2060 under the future high impact scenario. In support of the SSAs for northern long-eared bat, tricolored bat, and little brown bat, Whitby et al. (2022) found declines in the predicted relative abundance of all three species with an increasing wind energy risk index.

Throughout most of Michigan and North America, the bat species most commonly killed by wind turbines are migratory “tree bats,” including hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), Eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans). These species are not currently protected by state or federal endangered species laws, and there is no international treaty comparable to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to protect migratory bats. The number of bats of these species being killed at wind facilities far exceeds any other documented natural or human-caused sources of mortality. Basic demographic information for these species is lacking, making it difficult to assess population-level impacts. However, recent studies suggest that the population viability of hoary bats may be threatened by wind turbine fatalities (Pylant et al. 2016, Frick et al. 2017), with recent models predicting that the species could decline by as much as 90% by 2062 (Frick et al. 2017) and at least 50% by 2028 (Friedenberg and Frick 2021) compared to a 2012 baseline if no action is taken to curb wind-related mortality. Based on the 2024 National Listing Workplan, the USFWS plans to conduct a discretionary status review to evaluate the need to list the hoary bat as federally threatened or endangered in fiscal year 2028. Voluntary guidelines such as these BMPs may be the best tool for conserving species like these that lack protection under state or federal endangered species laws.

In addition to the dynamic influence of WNS, species composition of bat fatalities at Michigan wind facilities may be influenced by the recent northward and/or eastward-westward range expansion of several species. Michigan is at the northern edge of the respective ranges of the Indiana bat, tricolored bat, and evening bat. The first Indiana bat maternity colony was reported in 1978, and the only known Michigan hibernaculum (Tippy Dam) was discovered in 1994. Maternity roost trees for Indiana bats in Michigan tend to have a larger degree of solar exposure than elsewhere in the species’ range, and the species seem to have a prolonged growth period in Michigan compared to more southerly locations, presumably due to the cooler climate (Kurta et al. 1993). Kurta et al. (1993) speculated that if Indiana bats roosted much farther north, they would not be able to compress a prolonged growth period and extended migration into the available warm weather months. However, with warming climates, the species may continue to shift northward and utilize new hibernacula.

The tricolored bat is speculated to be a relatively recent resident of the central Great Lakes Basin, most likely colonizing Michigan during the mid-twentieth century (Burt 1957, Kurta et al. 2007, Brown and Kurta 2013). The species was first observed in Michigan in 1965, and until the local invasion of WNS, it was regularly reported in or near Michigan hibernacula during the winter and fall migration period. The consistent presence of both males and females and the species’ typically short migration range suggests a breeding population may have occurred and may still occur year-round in parts of the state; however, with very few exceptions, the species has not been observed in Michigan in the summer and no maternity colonies have been documented. The tricolored bat has been uncommon since it was first detected in Michigan. Although WNS has reduced the range-wide Indiana bat population by 19% (USFWS 2019) and Michigan’s hibernating tricolored bat population has declined by nearly 94% (Kurta and Smith 2020), recent or ongoing range expansion may still be influencing the local distribution of both the tricolored bat and the Indiana bat.

Although not affected by WNS, the evening bat is historically rare in Michigan and is state listed as threatened. Prior to the discovery of a maternity colony in Lenawee County in 2004, representing the northernmost known colony in North America, there were only three records of evening bats in Michigan (Kurta et al. 2005). Although still rare in the state, climate change may be altering the species’ local phenology and distribution (Munzer 2008). Increasing observations in recent years suggest the species is becoming more common in Michigan or advancing its range northward (Auteri and Kurta 2015, Auteri and Mies 2016). Evening bats have now been detected in seven southern Michigan counties, with wind-related fatalities first reported at a Michigan wind facility in 2021 (Consumers Energy Company 2022, USFWS unpublished data).

The Seminole bat (Lasiurus seminolus) is another southern migratory species whose range has been shifting rapidly northward and westward in recent years (Wilhide et al. 1998; Lacki et al. 2014, Perry et al. 2018). Based on museum records and mist net data from 1970 through 2018, the northern edge of the species’ range advanced by 521 km, with a northward expansion rate of 11 km per year (Perry 2018). Like other tree bats, Seminole bats engage in widespread, long-distance migrations in the fall and remain largely active year-round, occasionally hibernating under leaf litter in colder temperatures (Hein et al. 2005). Although still most abundant in the southeastern United States, they have been reported in unexpected locations, including the Caribbean, Wisconsin, and New York (Perry et al. 2018). Previously undocumented in Michigan, multiple Seminole bats fatalities have been reported at Michigan wind facilities since 2013 (Consumers Energy Company 2022, USFWS unpublished data), suggesting that their migratory range now includes Michigan. According to Perry and Thill (2008), range expansion in Seminole bats seems to follow a pattern of increasing autumn (migration season) observations followed by maternity period observations (suggesting colonization). To date, reported Seminole bat fatalities in Michigan have occurred between late August and October (USFWS, unpublished data).

Wind energy and eagles

Wind energy collisions present a proportionally higher risk to longer lived bird species like eagles due to their low reproductive rates. Even low rates of collision can equate to dozens of birds killed each year. Placement of turbines is the best way to reduce collisions and should take into account local wildlife attractants like migration routes and food sources.

Eagles are not listed as a state threatened or endangered species, but they are tracked as a species of greatest conservation need and they have special values to Michigan citizens. People enjoy seeing these large birds in the wild, they are a national symbol, and they have special cultural values to several tribes in Michigan. Additionally, the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits anyone, without a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, from taking bald or golden eagles, including their parts (including feathers), nests, or eggs. The USFWS issues and maintains permits for eagle take and provides additional information on eagle take permitting, as well as eagle conservation, through the Eagle Management Program.

Return to Table of Contents

How we envision industry using these best management practices

These BMPs are intended to exist alongside and independent Michigan’s wildlife regulations. Following the BMPs does not replace the need for renewable energy companies to consult with state and federal wildlife agencies to comply with state and federal endangered species laws and other wildlife laws, rules, and harvest regulations. These BMPs are intended to be used as voluntary practices to minimize risk and leverage benefits for a wide range of wildlife species, which may or may not be otherwise regulated.

Formal consultation on the impacts of wind energy facilities tends to focus on bats and eagles because state and federal laws regulate the take of eagles and endangered species. These voluntary best practices are much broader in that they consider impacts to wildlife species that have other values to Michigan’s citizens. For example, large blocks of public land, especially forested public land, are important stopover habitat for migrating neotropical songbirds. People value seeing and hearing those songbirds, and for birders, those species are a key part of a recreational activity that gives them a relationship with nature and natural places. Most of those neotropical migrating songbirds are not endangered. Even if facilities do not have an impact that would trigger federal regulations, the state has public trust responsibility for all wildlife within its borders, including neotropical migrating songbirds. Voluntary guidelines convey and make explicit the importance of wildlife conservation beyond the relatively small number of wildlife species that are regulated.

Not all best practices are equal, and many are context-specific. Some will have a broader impact on a wide array of species, benefitting many wildlife beyond regulated bats and eagles. These BMPs are for addressing impacts to all Michigan wildlife. We organize these BMPs in two tiers to communicate which are of the highest priority to Michigan’s wildlife. Our intent is to encourage a company to voluntarily follow all of the BMPs, and as many as practical of the “Additional Considerations,” to be able to say that they are following Voluntary BMPs for Wind Energy and Wildlife in Michigan.

Best Management Practices

The Michigan DNR and USFWS strongly encourage all wind energy operators in Michigan to implement voluntary measures to conserve bats, such as siting away from high-risk areas, such as bat hibernacula, feathering blades to slow rotation speeds when not generating electricity, and raising turbine cut-in speeds in areas, during times of year, and at temperatures and weather conditions with potential risk.

Return to Table of Contents

Consultation

Wildlife consultation in particular is usually centered on state threatened and endangered species, but it can include other wildlife topics such as wildlife-friendly fencing, avoiding deer entrapment, and important local wildlife corridors. The state agency maintains a separate, longer list of endangered species and a separate permitting program from the USFWS. The state list is updated periodically. In 2023, the list was updated to include many new species, including the northern long-eared bat, tri-colored bat, and little brown bat.

There are usually two components to consultation: a desktop environmental review and permitting. The first component is requesting a review for recent records of state threatened or endangered species within the project area. The DNR program to do these reviews was defunded over a decade ago. These reviews can be requested of the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) or consultants with access to the state’s Natural Heritage database that is maintained by MNFI.

The second component is determination if the proposed action risks take of a state threatened or endangered species, and if so, whether the proposed action can be modified to reduce the risk of take or if a state threatened or endangered species permit is necessary. The developer sends the desktop review of the natural heritage database to the DNR, and the DNR responds with a finding that there is or that there is not a risk to state threatened or endangered species. If avoidance is not possible, we recommend applying for a state threatened and endangered species permit. Because a small number of state threatened little brown bats have been taken at wind energy facilities across the state, we recommend all wind energy companies in the state operate under a state threatened and endangered species permit, which would define mitigation strategies such as cut-in speeds, allowable take, and reporting requirements. The risk that any one facility will take a state listed bat in a given year is low, but because there are many wind energy facilities, the risk that one of those facilities will experience take is high.

If a developer chooses to seek siting approval via the Michigan Public Service Commission, the MPSC application will require (among other things) proof of consultation with the Michigan DNR, including the review of the natural heritage database and the DNR determination of whether a permit was necessary.

While most state listed species are not federally listed, all federally listed species are also protected by state endangered species laws. Thus, we recommend as a best practice to consult with state wildlife agencies whenever consulting with the USFWS on issues related to take of threatened and endangered species.

In addition to formal threatened and endangered species consultation, the Michigan DNR is available to provide insight and informal advice on wildlife and wildlife-related concerns outside of the purview of state threatened and endangered species. Local communities are often concerned about impacts of development to common wildlife such as songbirds, waterfowl, or deer, and the DNR has expertise on the status and needs of these wildlife populations.

Site Evaluation

Identifying areas of risk and informing site selection and operation can be achieved through detailed pre-construction studies assessing local species composition and activity trends, as well as post-construction fatality monitoring. However, several broadscale landscape features are known to be generally predictive of bat (particularly Myotis and Perimyotis spp.) activity in Michigan, prior to collecting relevant site-specific data. Thus, evaluating and minimizing a proposed facility’s proximity to key landscape features is the recommended first step in reducing impacts to vulnerable bats.

Several studies (Kurta and Smith 2014, Heist et al. 2018, Kurta et al. 2018) have documented landscape features that pose greater risk to bats and birds. Particular geographies that pose higher risk are known from other studies and from post-construction monitoring at existing facilities. At the broadest scale, bats and birds are most common in and around forested landscapes in the northern part of the state, near Great Lakes shorelines, and near caves or cave-like structures. Areas with all three of these features, such as the Keweenaw Peninsula (and other peninsulas in Michigan Upper Peninsula) have especially high populations of bats and migratory birds.

The importance of feathering and cut-in speeds

In addition to siting wind turbines away from sensitive areas for bats, the only broadly proven and accepted method for reducing wind related bat fatality is to “feather” turbine blades (i.e., pitch turbine blades parallel with the prevailing wind direction to slow rotation speeds) during low wind speeds when bats are most at risk (Whitby et al. 2021). The wind speed at which turbine blades begin to generate electricity, known as the “cut-in speed,” can be set at the manufacturer’s recommended cut-in speed (typically between 3.0 and 4.0 m/s for contemporary turbines; Saint-Drenan et al. 2020) or at a higher threshold, typically referred to as operational curtailment. Even when turbine blades are not generating electricity, they continue to spin and pose a risk to wildlife unless they are feathered below the cut-in speed. The effectiveness of feathering below various cut-in speeds differs among sites and years (Arnett et al. 2013, Berthinussen et al. 2021); however, most studies have demonstrated all-bat fatality reductions of >50% associated with feathering below cut-in speeds raised 1.0–3.0 m/s above the manufacturer’s recommendation (Arnett et al. 2013, Adams et al. 2021, USFWS, unpublished data). A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that operational curtailment reduced fatalities, on average, by 33% (95% CI: 21%–43%) for each 1.0 m/s increase in cut-in speed (Whitby et al. 2021). Incorporating weather, time of day, and time of year into operational mitigation can protect bats while reducing energy losses and associated costs. For instance, Martin et al. (2017) found that raising cut-in speeds from 4.0 to 6.0 m/s whenever nightly wind speeds were <6.0 m/s and temperatures were >9.5 °C (49 °F) reduced fatality by 1.52–4.45 times and incorporating temperature decreased energy losses by 18%.

Trade-offs Between Siting and Cut-in Speeds Relative to Hibernacula

Wind energy did not cause them to become endangered, but cave-hibernating bats have recently experienced populations crashes that have caused their populations to decrease to the point that they will likely go extinct if other threats are not reduced. Wind energy is one of those threats. The little brown bat and tri-colored bat were added to the state threatened and endangered species list in 2023. The best practice is to use a combination of siting and feathering thresholds based on the relative risk of harming these species. Using a combination of bat survey data and known dispersal distances of different bats species, we mapped three levels of rare bat activity (Figure 1): high, medium, and low. High activity areas are areas within 10 miles of known hibernacula for state and threatened bats. Medium activity areas are high activity areas plus a 62-mile (100 km) buffer around hibernacula with historic maximum counts greater than 10,000 bats and an 55-mile (89 km) buffer around hibernacula with historic maximum counts of at least 1,000 bats. (The buffers were derived from little brown bat and northern long-eared bat migration distances and populations sizes used in the US Fish and Wildlife Service Species Status Assessments.) Best practices are to avoid siting wind energy facilities in high activity areas, i.e., within 10 miles of significant bat hibernacula (Figure 1). In medium activity areas (between 10 miles and 100 miles of major bat hibernacula), we recommend feathering turbine blades between 6.9 m/s and 5 m/s, depending on risk (e.g., nearer 6.9 in the 10 to 55 mile range and nearer 5 in the 55 to 100 mile range). Endangered little brown bats have been detected at low numbers statewide. Thus, the remainder of the state is a low bat activity area. We recommend feathering turbine blades below cut-in speeds of 5 m/s in areas with low activity (i.e., statewide, outside high or medium bat activity areas; Figure 1). The best times to implement feathering (e.g., “cut-in speeds”) are April 1 through October 31, when temperatures are above 50 °F, between sunset and sunrise.

An alternative BMP to seasonal cut-in speeds is Acoustic Based Informed Curtailments (ABIC; i.e., “smart curtailment”). We recommend that ABIC be implemented such that risk to bats is similar or lower than the seasonal cut-in speed BMPs (i.e., avoidance of risk in medium activity areas). ABIC is an experimental approach that is an alternative to blanket curtailment (Peterson et al. 2021, Rabie et al. 2022). Available technologies use acoustic activity (i.e., recorded bat echolocation calls) and/or other local variables (e.g., weather data) to minimize risk to bats while allowing more electricity generation when bats are not acoustically detected or unlikely to be present based on site-specific algorithms. We encourage wind energy operators to consider locally testing available technologies and/or implementing those demonstrated to be equally or more protective of bats than blanket curtailment. Smart curtailment is a rapidly developing conservation measure, and we recommend that those considering it consult the most recent peer reviewed literature or other guidance, such as recent avoidance guidance for tricolored bat.

Distance from state or federal public land

Bat and bird density in Michigan is higher in areas where wildlife habitat management intentionally draws in large numbers of migrating and nesting birds, especially waterfowl. These areas represent some of the best waterfowl hunting and birding opportunities in the state and development nearby would likely trigger opposition from local and regional stakeholders. To minimize risks to wildlife from collision and from avoidance during nesting season, we recommend siting wind energy facilities 2 miles from parcels of state and federal land managed for large wetlands and waterfowl hunting (e.g., federal wildlife refuges and state managed waterfowl hunting areas). This recommendation is based on 1) local land manager knowledge of flight patterns of waterfowl near large wetlands and 2) concern that wind energy towers and turbines could change if and how waterfowl use large wetlands as critical stopover sites on migration or during breeding.

Additional Considerations

Distance from Great Lakes shoreline

Great Lakes shorelines are used disproportionately by wildlife, especially migrating birds and bats. Because these species often roost near the lakeshore, the birds and bats fly at altitudes that match wind turbine rotor swept areas twice per day, as they take off in the morning and land in the evening. Radar studies have documented that this shoreline area of use extends as far as 12 miles inland, with areas nearer the lakeshore receiving even more intense use. For this reason, we recommend siting wind turbines at least 3 miles from Great Lakes shoreline, but we note that there are potentially benefits to siting even further from the shoreline, up to 12 miles.

Return to Table of Contents

Distance from eagle nests

We recommend that wind energy facilities not site individual turbines within 0.5 miles of known bald eagle nests to minimize the risk of bald eagle strikes from wind energy turbines.

Return to Table of Contents

Wildlife corridors and habitat fragmentation

As a best practice, we recommend that wind energy facilities avoid siting developments on or near important wildlife corridors that serve as concentrated movement corridors for wildlife that are impacted by wind energy (e.g., bats, eagles, and certain other species of birds). We also recommend avoiding siting wind energy facilities in large contiguous forested landscapes. These wildlife corridors and large, intact forests are relatively rare on the landscape, but they do sometimes coincide with geographies with high wind energy, such as peninsulas on the Great Lakes, shorelines, and forested ridges. The Keweenaw Peninsula is the definitive example: a peninsula with abundant shoreline and a prominent ridge that runs parallel to shoreline. It is used extensively by migrating birds, including eagles and hawks, and it has one of the highest concentrations of bat hibernacula in the state.

Corridors occur at two scales relevant to the siting of wind energy facilities. At the broad-scale, certain features tend to funnel birds and bats, especially while they are migrating through certain landscapes. At a finer scale, birds and bats will use hedgerows, less prominent ridges, and linear hydrology (rivers, streams, chains of wetlands) on daily movements between roosting and feeding areas. We recommend avoiding siting individual turbines in ways that fragment movement corridors. Several maps exist of wildlife corridors, including the Midwest Landscape Initiative Conservation Blueprint and The Nature Conservancy’s Connected and Resilient Lands map.

Bats and many rare birds are associated with large contiguous blocks of forest. Furthermore, many birds and bats focus their activity within non-forested openings within forested landscapes. For this reason, we recommend avoiding developing wind energy facilities within forested landscapes that have relatively low levels of fragmentation. That includes developments that break large, forested landscapes into smaller blocks and developments that are focused in open areas within forest landscapes.

We recommend siting in landscapes in which the matrix surrounding the facility (e.g., buffered by 5 miles) is less than 75% forested, and ideally no more than 50% forested.

Distance to bird conservation areas

Important Bird Areas (IBAs), state game areas, and national wildlife refuges are often protected and managed specifically for birds and bird conservation. These are areas of the landscape that likely have higher migratory bird (and bat) populations; thus, nearby wind developments pose a higher risk of harming or displacing wildlife. Like shoreline areas, these bird conservation areas often see increased bird use in morning and evenings during the migratory seasons. We recommend siting at least 1 mile from bird conservation areas.

Post construction monitoring

Post-construction monitoring is important to document the wildlife impacts of specific projects. Often post-construction monitoring is a condition of state or federal permits. This section is intended to encourage post construction monitoring as a best practice even in conditions or for species where it is not explicitly required in a regulatory framework.

The number and species of wildlife that are affected by wind energy varies from site to site. Although we can assess risk based on geographic features, such as distance to hibernacula or distance from shoreline, individual sites can have higher or lower impacts than expected. Thus, it is important to conduct post-construction monitoring.

Specific methods vary by location and species of concern. However, we do recommend that post-construction monitoring:

Extend over more than one year

Focus on the spring and fall risk periods

Account for detection rates and wildlife use

Standardize monitoring across locations and through time

Use reporting protocols that protect confidential data while allowing data to be aggregated for meta-analyses

Report mortality in a standardized way to aid comparisons across facilities

Regional trend data is especially important for species such as hoary bat, which research suggests may face serious population level challenges from wind energy mortality (Frick et al. 2017, Friedenberg and Frick 2021). A range-wide effort to keep common species from ending up on the endangered species list is most likely to be effective and economical if all parties are engaged and sharing data (Conkling et al. 2020).

Distance from local attractants

Certain human and natural features on the landscape attract wildlife. We recommend that turbine layout take into consideration higher wildlife use near (within ~200 m) of local attractants such as woodlots, wetlands, ponds, and commercial dairy/cattle operations. (Dairy/cattle operations attract scavengers, including eagles.)

Meteorological (“met”) tower guy wires and lighting

Wires from the ground to meteorological (met) towers can harm birds. We recommend free-standing met towers rather than towers with guy wires to reduce this risk. If met towers cannot be free-standing, we recommend installing bird deterrents to guyed wires. Similarly, security lights that remain on all night attract insects, which can attract bats. We recommend using motion-sensor, down-shielded security lights to avoid attracting bats to an area. Finally, steady (not flashing) lights on towers can attract birds or disrupt their migratory patterns. We recommend using flashing tower lights.

Emerging technologies to reduce risk to wildlife

Many efforts are underway to improve our understanding of bat interactions with wind turbines and explore additional strategies for reducing bat mortality at wind facilities. For example, acoustic-activated “smart” curtailment aims to focus operational curtailment when bat activity is detected in real time (e.g., Hayes et al. 2019, Berthinussen et al. 2021, Hein and Straw 2021). Additionally, researchers are exploring whether illuminating turbines with dim ultraviolet light may deter bats from approaching them (Cryan et al. 2016, Berthinussen et al. 2021, Hein and Straw 2021, Cryan et al. 2022). Further, researchers have tested applying a textured coating to the surface of the turbine to alter bats’ perception of the turbine (Bennett and Hale 2019, Berthinussen et al. 2021, Hein and Straw 2021). However, more research is needed to determine the broad efficacy of fatality reduction technologies beyond various operational (feathering) strategies. We recommend that facilities incorporate emerging deterrence technologies, and where possible, work with researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of such technologies.

Maps

There are several maps that can be used to inform wildlife risk in broad-scale project siting. We provide maps that outline high, medium, and low bat activity areas: high activity areas within 10 miles of major bat hibernacula; medium activity areas within 100 miles of major bat hibernacula; the entire state outside the high and medium bat activity areas as a low bat activity area. Zones are determined by surveys at bat hibernacula that detected state or federally threatened or endangered bats, as well as relative numbers of bat mortalities detected at existing wind energy facilities (Figure 1). Maps are up to date as of 2025.

Maps maintained by other entities may also be relevant to preliminary site assessments. For example, The Nature Conservancy has developed a Site Renewables Right tool that provides geographic information on risk to wildlife, communities, and ecosystem services. Similarly, the USFWS developed a Great Lakes Airspace Map Decision Support Tool, which maps concentrations of bird and bat use using radar and acoustic monitors. Audubon maintains a map of Important Bird Areas. We encourage developers to use these tools and others listed in the next section to support and supplement voluntary BMP considerations.

BMP development

This set of BMPs was developed by DNR Wildlife Division staff, with input from the USFWS, over the course of four years (2022–2025). We also sought review of previous drafts from DNR staff in 2022. In 2023, we solicited review from external reviewers including public utilities, researchers, developers, wildlife organizations, other states, and American Clean Power. Several reviewers suggested substantive reorganization of the document, and the need for another round of review. During the time we were reorganizing this document, the regulatory environment underwent considerable changes. The state threatened and endangered species list was revised, and new laws were passed regarding siting of renewable energy and storage, which required further revisions. Two additional rounds of review occurred in 2025.

Appendix 1: Other guidance and BMPs

USFWS WEG

Many Michigan wind developers may be familiar with the USFWS Voluntary Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines (WEG; USFWS 2012). The WEG provide a structured, scientific process for addressing wildlife conservation concerns at all stages of land-based wind energy development. They also promote effective communication among wind energy developers and federal, state, tribal, and local conservation agencies. In addition, the WEG provide best management practices for site development, construction, retrofitting, repowering, and decommissioning.

The WEG emphasize the importance of consulting with the USFWS and state agencies early in the development of a wind energy project. Early consultation offers the greatest opportunity for avoiding areas where development is precluded or where wildlife impacts are likely to be high and difficult or costly to remedy or mitigate at a later stage. By consulting early, project developers can also incorporate appropriate wildlife conservation measures and monitoring into their decisions about project siting, design, and operation.

The WEG use a “tiered approach” for assessing potential adverse effects to species of concern and their habitats. The tiered approach is an iterative decision-making process for collecting information in increasing detail; quantifying the possible risks of proposed wind energy projects to species of concern and habitats; and evaluating those risks to make siting, construction, and operation decisions.

During the pre-construction tiers (Tiers 1, 2, and 3), developers work with the USFWS and state DNR to identify and avoid and minimize risks to species of concern. During post-construction tiers (Tiers 4 and 5), developers assess whether actions taken in earlier tiers to avoid and minimize impacts are successfully achieving the goals and, when necessary, taking additional steps to reduce impacts. Subsequent tiers refine and build upon issues raised and efforts undertaken in previous tiers. Each tier offers a set of questions to help the developer evaluate the potential risk associated with developing a project at the given location.

Adherence to the WEG is voluntary and does not relieve any individual, company, or agency of the responsibility to comply with laws and regulations. However, if a violation occurs the USFWS can consider a developer’s documented efforts to communicate with the Service and adhere to the WEG.

Communication Framework for Wind Energy Project Proponents and State Fish and Wildlife Agencies (link)

Similar to the WEG, the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (AFWA) and the American Clean Power Association (ACP) have developed a set of voluntary communication guidelines to clarify expectations about when and how state agencies desire to be included in discussions about wind energy developments. Each state has different laws and regulations, but the framework outlines some common themes around relationship building, preliminary site evaluation, site characterization, field studies and impact prediction, post construction studies, and other post-construction studies and research. As discussed elsewhere in this document, the Michigan DNR encourages early consultation and joint meetings with the USFWS Michigan Ecological Services Field Office and Migratory Birds Program Office.

Red File avoidance criteria

In 1984, Michigan received authorization from the federal government to administer Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) in most areas of the state. A state-administered 404 program must be consistent with the requirements of the federal CWA and associated regulations set forth in the Section 404(b)(1) guidelines. In other states, an applicant must apply to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and a state agency for wetland, lakes, and streams permits; whereas applicants in Michigan generally submit only one wetland permit application to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) and receive both federal and state authorization with a wetland permit.

Federal oversight of state-administered 404 programs is primarily the responsibility of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The department’s 1983 Memorandum of Agreement (as amended) with USEPA Region 5 outlines the procedures to be followed in program administration. This agreement waives federal review of the vast majority of applications in areas under Michigan’s 404 jurisdiction. However, federal agencies must review projects which impact critical environmental areas, or which involve major discharges. These projects are identified in the Memorandum of Agreement and include:

Projects affecting one or more acre of wetland

New construction of breakwaters or seawalls with a total length of more than 1,000 feet

Enclosure of more than 300 feet of a stream in one or more segments

Relocation or channelization of more than 1,000 feet of a stream in one or more segments

Projects with potential to affect endangered or threatened species as determined by the USFWS

Discharges to waters of another state, suspected to contain toxic pollutants or hazardous substances, located in proximity of a public water supply intake, or within defined state or federal critical areas

These above projects are called “Red Files” and require concurrent review by federal partners such as USACE and USFWS. Red Files may result in additional permit processing time depending on the complexity of the project. At the present time, USEPA reviews about one percent of all applications received. If EGLE determines that an application under Michigan’s 404 program is subject to federal review, copies of the public notice are sent to USEPA Region 5, Detroit District Corps, and USFWS. The USEPA is responsible for compiling all federal comments and submitting comments on the federal position to EGLE. These files do not require additional fees beyond those defined by EGLE. These types of projects do not include those also requiring authorization by the USACE under Section 10 of the CWA, which do contain additional fees and requirements as set forth by that agency. These projects utilize the same joint permit application but require separate review processes by the state and federal government, resulting in separate permit authorizations.

EGLE may not issue a permit which carries Section 404 authority if the USEPA objects to the project. This is true even if the applicant successfully appeals the state’s denial of a permit at the administrative level or through a state court. Section 404 provides for a reversion to USACE processing if a state and the USEPA reach an impasse on a project (that is, if the state is prepared to issue a permit, but USEPA continues to object).

Because of the high potential for federally protected birds and bats to be impacted by wind energy development, the USFWS and EGLE have an agreement that all wetland permits associated with a utility-scale wind development should be Red-Filed for federal review. However, the agencies have also developed a screening tool to exempt certain developments from Red-Filing on the basis of impacts to federally protected birds and bats if they can apply certain specified conservation measures as permit conditions. If EGLE staff determine that a proposed wind development project does not need to be Red-Filed for federally protected bats and birds, they follow additional normal screening processes for all other species.

If an applicant does not agree to the specified permit conditions for birds and bats, the USFWS will review the permit application under the Red File review process and provide project specific recommendations to USEPA. In some cases, the USFWS may provide a wind developer a letter prior to a wetland permit application submission documenting that the proposed development has adequately addressed the potential for adverse effects to federally protected birds and bats using alternative site-specific measures for incorporation as permit conditions. In such cases, the letter will clearly indicate that the coordination with USFWS is complete, and the application does not need to be Red Filed provided the permit conditions are incorporated into any EGLE permit.

Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs)

Per Section 10 of the ESA, incidental take permits (ITPs) may be sought whenever a non-federal entity believes their otherwise lawful activities are likely to result in take of federally threatened or endangered wildlife. A habitat conservation plan (HCP) must accompany an application for an ITP. HCPs describe the anticipated effects of the proposed taking; how those impacts will be minimized and/or mitigated; and how the HCP is to be funded. HCPs can apply to both listed and non-listed species, including those that are candidates or have been proposed for listing. Conserving species before they are in danger of extinction or are likely to become so can also provide early benefits and prevent the need for listing.

Early and frequent coordination with the USFWS can help determine whether a proposed wind development is likely to result in incidental take of listed species and whether an HCP is needed. Wind developers seeking an ITP are encouraged to work closely with the USFWS during the development of an HCP to ensure conservation measures are sufficient to avoid jeopardizing the survival or recovery of listed species and that impacts of the proposed taking are minimized and mitigated to the maximum extent practicable.

While wind developments in Michigan typically do not include a federal nexus, proposed developments initiated, authorized, or funded by a federal agency must evaluate potential effects and/or receive incidental take authorization for listed species through Section 7 of the ESA.

Eagle Conservation Plan (ECP)

In addition to ITPs for ESA-listed species, eagle take permits (ETPs) are available to individuals, agencies, businesses, and other organizations under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA) when take of eagles may result from, but is not the purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity. Incidental take includes disturbing eagles as well as killing and injuring them. ETPs do not authorize possession of any eagle, eagle parts, or eagle nests.

The USFWS’s Eagle Conservation Plan Guidance (ECPG) provides specific in-depth guidance for conserving bald and golden eagles during siting, construction, and operation of wind energy facilities, and supplements the WEG. Like the WEG, the ECPG calls for wind project developers to take a staged approach to siting new projects. Both guidance documents call for preliminary landscape-level assessments to assess potential wildlife interactions and proceed to site-specific surveys and risk assessments prior to construction. They also call for monitoring project operations and reporting eagle fatalities to the USFWS and state and tribal wildlife agencies.

Compliance with the ECPG is voluntary, but the guidance is intended to help project operators in complying with regulatory requirements and avoiding unintentional take of eagles at wind energy facilities, while assisting the wind energy industry in providing the biological data necessary to support permit applications for facilities that may pose a risk to eagles.

OneClickDIY, an online retailer of premium insulation and DIY supplies, has released a comprehensive guide detailing how homeowners can qualify for up to $3,200 in federal tax credits through DIY spray foam insulation projects. The guide addresses growing concerns about winter heating costs, which are projected to increase by 7.6 percent this heating season, according to recent energy market analyses.

The new resource comes as homeowners face mounting energy expenses and seek practical solutions to reduce heating bills. Industry data indicates that typical homes lose between 25 and 33 percent of their heat through inadequately insulated walls and roofs, making insulation improvements a critical consideration for household budgets. The guide specifically focuses on how DIY spray foam insulation projects can qualify for the Federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, also known as the 25C tax credit.

Under current federal tax provisions, homeowners can claim up to $1,200 annually for qualified insulation and air sealing materials, representing 30 percent of project costs. The broader energy efficiency credit allows for a maximum of $3,200 per year when combined with other qualifying improvements. Spray Foam Insulation materials that meet Energy Star requirements are eligible for this credit, making DIY installation projects particularly attractive for cost-conscious homeowners.

“Rising energy costs have prompted many homeowners to explore the benefits of spray foam insulation for homes, and the availability of federal tax credits makes these improvements even more accessible,” said a spokesperson from OneClickDIY. “This guide provides homeowners with the information they need to understand both the immediate tax advantages and long-term energy savings associated with DIY spray foam projects.”

The guide examines the dual functionality of spray foam as both an insulator and air sealant, addressing two major sources of energy loss in residential structures. It includes detailed comparisons of DIY kit costs against potential energy savings and tax benefits, helping homeowners make informed decisions about their insulation investments. The resource also covers proper installation techniques, safety considerations, and documentation requirements for claiming tax credits.

OneClickDIY has positioned the guide as part of its commitment to supporting the DIY community with educational resources and authentic products. As the only authorized reseller of Stanley insulation products in the United States, and an authorized distributor for brands including Kraken Bond, Sprayman, and Akfix, the company maintains a comprehensive inventory of spray foam insulation kits and related materials.

The release of this guide reflects broader industry trends toward energy-efficient home improvements. With heating and cooling accounting for approximately 50 percent of typical home energy consumption, proper insulation represents one of the most effective strategies for reducing utility costs and improving home comfort.

OneClickDIY specializes in providing DIY spray foam and sealant kits for professionals and homeowners. The company offers a comprehensive range of products, including DIY spray foam insulation kits, two-component spray foam systems, caulks, sealants, adhesives, and specialty installation tools.

WASHINGTON—President Trump today issued an Executive Order to launch the Genesis Mission, a historic national effort led by the Department of Energy. The Genesis Mission will transform American science and innovation through the power of artificial intelligence (AI), strengthening the nation’s technological leadership and global competitiveness.

The ambitious mission will harness the current AI and advanced computing revolution to double the productivity and impact of American science and engineering within a decade. It will deliver decisive breakthroughs to secure American energy dominance, accelerate scientific discovery, and strengthen national security.

“Throughout history, from the Manhattan Project to the Apollo mission, our nation’s brightest minds and industries have answered the call when their nation needed them,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Today, the United States is calling on them once again. Under President Trump’s leadership, the Genesis Mission will unleash the full power of our National Laboratories, supercomputers, and data resources to ensure that America is the global leader in artificial intelligence and to usher in a new golden era of American discovery.”

The announcement builds on President Trump’s Executive Order Removing Barriers to American Leadership In Artificial Intelligence and advances his America’s AI Action Plan released earlier this year—a directive to remove barriers to innovation, reduce dependence on foreign adversaries, and unleash the full strength of America’s scientific enterprise.

Secretary Wright has designated Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil to lead the initiative. The Genesis Mission will mobilize the Department of Energy’s 17 National Laboratories, industry, and academia to build an integrated discovery platform.

The platform will connect the world’s best supercomputers, AI systems, and next-generation quantum systems with the most advanced scientific instruments in the nation. Once complete, the platform will be the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built. It will draw on the expertise of roughly 40,000 DOE scientists, engineers, and technical staff, alongside private sector innovators, to ensure that the United States leads and builds the technologies that will define the future.

The Genesis Mission will focus on addressing three key challenges of national importance:

American energy dominance: The Genesis Mission will accelerate advanced nuclear, fusion, and grid modernization using AI to provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy for Americans.

The EcoCar Electric Vehicle Challenge team is showing off its work to the public on the MSU campus.

The 4-year project takes a base electric vehicle and enhances it with more eco-friendly and safety modifications.

“What we are doing is adding adaptive cruise-control, which slows down when it sees a vehicle in front of it and lane-centering control, which steers the vehicle and maintains it in the center of the lane,” Sam Ball said. “We also added automatic intersection navigation, which is a bonus feature that the LYRIQ does not have at stock. It allows one to go to a red light, see that it is red, stop, and then go when it is green.”

Team leaders provided a demonstration of the new Cadillac LYRIQ, showcasing its features, including LiDAR.

Visitors were also able to hear from experts about the future of accessible, long-lasting, independent driving.

Car team leader Isaac Alanis said the hands-on experience is a win-win for them as students, as the project puts them behind the wheel of what’s happening in the real-world automotive industry.

“I always loved automotive since I was a little kid,” Alanis said. “So working on a project like this is really cool, especially since I’m working with General Motors, this is one of my leading jobs, I want to go to. I was lucky to get an internship with them this summer, so showcasing this to fellow MSU students who are also my peers, is a really cool experience and I enjoy it a lot.”

MSU professor John Ball said it is satisfying helping students be a part of the next generation of advanced vehicle engineering.

“Many students go on and work at different automotive companies but others go to different places and the skills that they learn here: the software, teamwork, ability’s to work together solve hard problems, that’s going to help them anywhere,” Ball said. “Most of them it is not a question of if they are going to get a job, it’s which one they are going to take.”

The requirement hasn't just worried Democrats, who sent a letter to the Trump administration sounding the alarm.
The Sierra Solar project in Churchill County is scheduled to begin generating electricity next May, with full build-out expected by 2027.","Nevada is one of the sunniest states in the country, so it makes perfect sense that solar power has become a major part of the Silver State's clean energy transition. Big projects are coming online, and renewable energy production has been climbing.

But state officials and some in the solar industry fear policy changes implemented by the Trump administration could slow progress at a critical moment.

Will Nevada see a solar power slowdown under 'red tape' policies of Trump administration?

In Churchill County, crews are installing 1.1 million solar panels as part of NV Energy's 'Sierra Solar' project, one of the utility's largest projects in the state. When fully complete, it will generate 400 megawatts of electricity, which is enough to power a third of all the homes and businesses in northern Nevada on an average day.

""They're absolutely critical. Not only are they important to meet the renewable portfolio standard, but they're actually important to meet the increasing demand of energy that we're seeing within our service territory,"" said Jesse Murray, NV Energy's senior vice president of electric delivery.

Murray told News 4-Fox 11 projects like Sierra Solar are essential if the utility is to meet the state-required renewable portfolio standard, which requires that 50% of all power in Nevada must come from renewable sources by 2030. In 2024, 46.8% of the electricity generated in state came from renewable sources.

But now some fear good progress made so far could slow down under the new direction of the Trump administration, which has enacted policies and added bureaucratic red tape.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, set a 2027 deadline for companies to claim solar tax credits. A memo issued the same month requires Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally sign off on green energy projects on public land, an extra hurdle that could slow the approval of projects.

Talk about bureaucratic red tape, that is going to slow everything down.

""If it takes too long for the Secretary to make a determination based on all the other things he's got to do, to get to those reviews is going take some time for him. And if it slows these projects down, we may lose them,"" Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, told News 4-Fox 11.

""We may lose these renewable energy projects. They cost money. Investors are not going to stay forever. These projects are not gonna be there forever. And then we lose jobs in Nevada, and we lose the ability to grow our economy.""

The requirement hasn't just worried Democrats, who sent a letter to the Trump administration sounding the alarm.

Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo, a Republican, sent federal officials a letter warning them that the additional oversight has 'frozen' the industry, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. His office did not respond to multiple emails seeking an interview for this story.

Some reports this fall suggested the Bureau of Land Management had canceled the largest solar project in the country in Esmeralda County, commonly referred to as the 'Esmeralda 7.'

The agency disputed that and said the project could still move forward but with a different approach, according to The Nevada Independent. And President Trump posted on Truth Social that his administration 'will not approve wind or farmer destroying solar.'

On the ground, all the uncertainty is shaping decisions about where and how to develop grid-scale solar projects.

In the Honey Lake Valley north of Reno, Ultreia Group consultant Brent Moore is working to kickstart the 250-megawatt Sunseeker Solar project.

Because the project is already fully permitted and not located on federal land, Moore believes the project will advance. He worries, however, that similar efforts on or passing through federal lands across the West may struggle to clear new federal hurdles.

""Right now, if you want to develop power, you pretty much need to be on private land, and you need to ensure that that private land has no nexus to the federal government,"" he said. ""Now we're fighting a federal government who wants to impede the public policies and the state rights of the Western U.S.""

For NV Energy's part, Murray said the utility is still executing and following its integrated resource plan to reach the 50% renewables mark by 2030.

""I think right now we're still executing to our plan. Like I said, we go through the integrated resource planning process,"" he said.

Certainly, we're gonna evaluate any policy changes and that's common, right? We deal with that in our business, that's just how things go. And so as we do see changes in policy or changes in direction, we will evaluate those.

The Sierra Solar project in Churchill County is scheduled to begin generating electricity next May, with full build-out expected by 2027. In addition to solar power generation, the project also includes 400 megawatts of battery storage, allowing NV Energy to hold power generated during low-demand periods and send it back to customers when demand increases.

As for Sunseeker Solar, Moore said he hopes the project can begin construction in about a year.",https://mynews4.com/resources/media/1b6df5a9-5a0f-4e7d-afb7-8f9fd8347c7a-DJI_0016.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 13:01:07.583645

Time is running out to take advantage of tax credits that lower the cost of home improvements to help your household use less energy.

The federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit partially reimburses households for investments such as new exterior windows and doors, efficient heaters and insulation. The credit was extended and expanded by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under then-President Joe Biden, then cut short by the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump this summer.

Households have until Dec. 31 to make home improvements that can qualify for the credits.

“You should act on this right now,” said Jeaneen Zappa, executive director of the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance, a trade association representing businesses that do energy efficiency work in Pennsylvania. “This is a wonderful opportunity in the face of rising rates.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What does the tax credit cover?

The nonrefundable tax credit can reduce a household’s tax burden by up to $3,200.

Eligible services and purchases include home energy audits, insulation, air sealing, energy-efficient windows, exterior doors, new central air conditioners, energy-efficient heaters and heat pumps. Households can claim 30% of these expenses, with limits on certain items — such as $600 for a heater or air conditioner, $1,200 for insulation and $2,000 for a heat pump.

“All of these things matter,” Zappa said. “Usually, the building shell, the building envelope, is the best place to start to really make significant improvement in reducing your energy use and therefore cost and [raising] your comfort inside that home.”

The energy efficiency tax credits saved households in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey roughly $205 million in tax year 2023, according to IRS data.

Is there still time to make home improvements before the end of the year?

Zappa said none of the home improvements covered by the tax credit are “impossible” to accomplish before the end of the year.

“I think it depends on if you can get a contractor,” she said.

Don Naughton, owner of Pennsylvania-based Energy Saving Construction, said there’s still time for homeowners to get energy audits and weatherization done through his company before the end of the year. He said audits generally take a day or two, while air sealing and insulation can take up to a week.

As of mid-November, his company was booked until early December, he said.

“They call me soon, we’ll get it all in,” Naughton said.

To qualify, home improvements must be installed by the end of the day on Dec. 31, Zappa said.

Expert recommends energy audit and weatherization

If you want to take advantage of the tax credits before they expire, Simi Hoque, a professor of architectural engineering at Drexel University who studies energy conservation, recommends hiring a professional to audit your home’s energy use. The tax credit offers up to $150 toward the cost of a home energy audit done by a certified auditor.

Energy auditors find the places your home is losing heat in the winter or gaining heat in the summer. They use giant fans to suck air out of a home, pulling outside air in through cracks. They identify leaky areas using tools like infrared cameras.

Next, Hoque recommends weatherizing your home by sealing up any cracks identified in the energy audit. Weatherization can consist of installing gaskets around exterior doors, sealing cracks around window frames or insulating an attic. These measures can pay for themselves in energy savings within a few years, Hoque said.

“For the most part, when people do weatherize their house, it pays itself back,” Hoque said. “Even if they didn’t have the tax credit.”

Hoque only recommends buying a new heater if your current heater is inefficient and at the end of its life. If you need to replace it now anyway, the tax credit is a good way to lower the cost.

Hoque says a heat pump is a climate-friendly, but pricey, option.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/img_5943-20731a0ceb48aeaba09a1bdeebba11a38851f891.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 07:58:59.535064

In total, around 80 countries called for such a roadmap to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, including Australia and Brazil, while a similar number of countries were thought to have opposed such a roadmap, including Saudi Arabia and Russia. However, none of the latter countries identified themselves publicly.

This fracturing compromises the “global mutirão” – “collective efforts” – aspect of the summit, and has led to a number of separate agreements, including 24 countries signing the “Belém declaration on the just transition away from fossil fuels” and Colombia and the Netherlands announcing plans to host a conference on transitioning away from fossil fuels in Colombia next April.

This lack of formal progress towards the clean energy transition could be a blow to the global solar PV sector, which has already seen a slowdown in deployment this year. Leading solar markets such as the US and Europe have seen the rate of new solar capacity slow due to a combination of political uncertainty and macroeconomic pressures, and while the COP30 agreement noted that “significant global progress” had been made towards the clean energy transition, the implementation of a formal electricity generation roadmap could have helped tackle some of the uncertainties affecting the global solar sector.

Delivering the ‘Baku to Belém roadmap’

One area in which there is a formal roadmap to accelerate the energy transition, however, is the “Baku to Belém roadmap”, a programme for generating additional financing for the transition. The idea for such a roadmap was first discussed at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan, and the new roadmap was published ahead of this year’s event, targeting annual investment of “at least US$1.3 trillion” into developing countries, and US$3.2 trillion into the global energy transition, by 2035.

“That roadmap is a powerful signal of confidence—that the US$1.3 trillion annual flow of climate finance needed by 2035 is both achievable as well as essential and offers concrete examples of what can work,” said UN climate change executive secretary Simon Stiell. “Without this finance, climate action won’t happen. It’s only finance at this scale that can equally turn the tide on implementation as well as ensure climate action continues to be the road that makes business sense.”

Attendees agreed that “developer country parties” should take the lead in this regard, and deploy public and “grand-based resources and highly concessional finance” to this end, suggesting that a combination of financing types will be necessary to meet these targets.

Indeed, a report from the London School of Economics (LSE) found that public finance would likely have to make up half of the investment if the world is to meet the US$3.2 trillion by 2035 scenario. Considering achieving just the US$1.3 trillion target for developing countries would require a sevenfold increase in investment between 2022 and 2035, this is a highly ambitious target, and comes at a time where there is considerable uncertainty in many countries’ economic situations.

At this year’s Intersolar Europe event, held in Germany, industry experts said on a panel hosted by Solar Media that creative solutions will be required to secure finance in an increasingly risk-averse landscape. Similarly, in the US, uncertainty over tax credit policy in particular could threaten “tens of billions” of dollars of renewable energy investment, creating challenges for both policymakers and private financiers on both sides of the Atlantic.

The closing of COP30 follows the publication of a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which found that, despite these uncertainties, the world invested US$554 billion into solar projects in 2024, the most among renewable electricity generation sources. The economic efficiency of solar PV is well-documented, as the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar projects has fallen consistently over the last decade, potentially creating an economic opportunity for more investment in the solar sector.

Indeed, the final COP30 documentation “acknowledges that significant global progress has been made over the last decade, including rapid advancements in and declining costs of technologies and record levels of global renewable energy capacity and clean energy investments and highlights the economic and social benefits and opportunities of climate action, including economic growth, job creation, improved energy access and security and improved public health.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UN-Climate-Change-Kiara-Worth.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 12:02:58.263668

All prior five-year offshore drilling plans — dating back to 1980 — reference NEPA analyses.
But in its proposal, BOEM called that NEPA analysis “discretionary,” citing two past rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that dismissed challenges to NEPA analyses of five-year plans.

The decision to forgo the review under the National Environmental Policy Act comes as the Trump administration pushes to increase fossil fuel production and roll back environmental regulations. Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management laid out a proposal last week to hold 34 oil and gas lease sales in federal waters between 2026 and 2031 — including in new areas off California, in the High Arctic and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

All prior five-year offshore drilling plans — dating back to 1980 — reference NEPA analyses. But in its proposal, BOEM called that NEPA analysis “discretionary,” citing two past rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that dismissed challenges to NEPA analyses of five-year plans.

Per the court’s rulings, BOEM wrote, approval of a five-year plan “does not constitute an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources, and that, in the context of BOEM’s multiple stage leasing program, the obligation to fully comply with NEPA does not mature until the lease sale stage.”

The agency said it is instead preparing an environmental analysis “outside of the NEPA framework.” The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which is the legal basis of the five-year leasing plans, requires that the agency balance national interests in energy supply and environmental protection.

Meeting that requirement likely means still analyzing threats to coastlines and species from drilling and oil spills, legal experts and environmental advocates said.

Travis Annatoyn, a former deputy solicitor for energy and mineral resources at the Interior Department in the Biden administration, said Interior’s position was reasonable in light of recent court decisions, but said those decisions have not been tested “against a five-year program with no NEPA whatsoever.” Aside from ongoing legal questions over whether those reviews must include climate impacts, the OCSLA review of the five-year program requires a look at threatened species, risks of oil spills and affects to coastlines.

“The big question will be how deep is that analysis and how much does the agency defer until the lease sale stage,” said Annatoyn, who is now counsel at the Arnold & Porter law firm.

Steven Siros, a partner at the law firm Jenner & Block, said by email Saturday that while BOEM may have a legal basis for concluding the NEPA review at this stage was “discretionary,” it is less clear whether that decision could be made automatically.

“Some might argue that at a minimum, an environmental assessment is required to evaluate whether the plan does make any specific resource commitments that might require further NEPA review,” Siros said by email.

BOEM did not respond to a request for comment. But in its planning document, the agency said that its environmental analysis will consider potential environmental effects from lease sales, as well as effects that “could be experienced beyond BOEM program area boundaries, such as potential impacts on migratory animals.”

A Thursday press release from Interior also emphasizes that “each lease sale will undergo additional review, environmental analysis, and opportunities for public comment.”

Still, environmentalists are concerned.

“NEPA clearly applies and there is no exception for the five-year planning process,” said George Torgun, a senior attorney at Earthjustice. He noted that agencies at Interior have prepared programmatic environmental impact statements for every prior five-year leasing plan.

“It’s hard to see how Interior can possibly evaluate the relevant factors under OCSLA without a careful environmental review,” Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said by email. “But I’m not surprised to see this administration giving short shrift to its legal obligations to appease oil executives.”

Florida moratorium

The drilling plans include a new swath of the eastern Gulf, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The proposal has already angered Florida Republicans, who joined Democrats in opposition. The state’s politicians have long opposed drilling in the area over fears that an oil spill could devastate the state’s tourism industry.

BOEM is proposing to open a new leasing area that abuts a “100-mile coastal buffer” along Florida’s shores. The leasing area — called “Gulf of America Program Area B“— would start 100 miles off Florida’s western coast, though it also excludes the region of ocean that is east of a north-south line beginning roughly where Tallahassee is in Florida’s panhandle.

That region overlaps with a swath of ocean where Trump prohibited drilling in 2020, saying at the time that drilling off Florida’s coast was “not going to happen” because “the people of Florida just don’t want it.”

That moratorium ends in 2032. The proposal lists two lease sales in the area for 2029, but BOEM emphasizes that the proposal “only facilitates further information gathering and analysis of these areas, and it is not a final decision to offer these areas for lease.”

“The President and the Secretary will have the opportunity to use the information gathered and analyses developed during this process to exercise their discretion under … the OCS Lands Act and make more informed decisions on what areas should be made available for leasing,” the proposal said.

Five-year leasing plans often change before they’re finalized, with administrations sometimes winnowing down lease sales in response to feedback from the public and state governments.

To allow drilling before 2032, Trump’s prior withdrawal under OCSLA would have to be altered, said Andrew Hartsig, the Ocean Conservancy’s Arctic program senior director, in an email.

That could stir up legal wrangling.

During Trump’s first term, he attempted to undo an Obama-era withdrawal of waters in the Arctic Ocean from offshore drilling. Judge Sharon Gleason of the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska ruled in 2019 that the law did not allow that; a president could withdraw areas from leasing, but not undo a prior withdrawal.

Former President Joe Biden later reversed Trump’s efforts to open up the Arctic Ocean to drilling. But the legal fight has been resurrected as Trump again seeks to expand drilling in the Arctic; conservation groups sued over the issue earlier this year.

Competing efforts to withdraw or open areas to new drilling “squares up this issue of whether [a withdrawal] is truly a one-way ratchet or not,” said Jason Hill, a partner with the Holland & Knight law firm in Houston who served at Interior during Trump’s first term.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/bd/26/c7a8f3be44818bcd40e9275ce6d2/gulf-of-mexico-offshore-methane-64070.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:03:56.963883

What began as a gradual shift toward cleaner transportation has now become a geopolitical, economic and technological race that is reshaping global markets, trade balances and industrial strategies, News.az reports.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and advanced battery technologies are no longer niche alternatives – they are the core drivers of the next industrial revolution, influencing everything from mineral supply chains and energy markets to national security policies and global alliances.

Over the past decade, EV adoption has accelerated at an unprecedented pace. According to international energy forecasts, electric vehicles could account for more than half of all new car sales by 2035. This explosive growth is fueled by several factors: stricter emission standards, climate commitments, lower production costs and breakthrough innovations that have dramatically extended driving range. However, behind this surge lies an equally significant story – the battery revolution, which dictates the pace of the entire EV ecosystem.

At the center of this transformation is the global competition for dominance in battery manufacturing. Lithium-ion batteries, once considered an expensive luxury used only in electronics, have become the heart of modern mobility. The world’s largest economies have recognized that controlling battery production is synonymous with controlling the future of the car industry. China currently leads the field, producing more than 70 percent of global EV batteries, thanks to early investments, massive state support and control over critical mineral supply chains in Africa, Latin America and Central Asia. Chinese companies such as CATL and BYD have gained technological advantages that allow them to produce high-efficiency batteries at lower costs, reshaping the competitive landscape for American, European and Japanese manufacturers.

This dominance has triggered strategic responses across the world. The United States, through the Inflation Reduction Act, is investing billions to stimulate domestic battery and EV production, reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains and attract global manufacturers. Europe, meanwhile, is scrambling to build its own Gigafactories, fearing that a failure to catch up could make the continent permanently dependent on imports for both batteries and vehicles. The European Union’s push to phase out internal combustion engines by 2035 has forced automakers to rethink long-term strategies, invest in new technologies and forge alliances with battery manufacturers from Asia to North America.

Battery chemistry itself is undergoing a technological revolution. Solid-state batteries, which promise faster charging times, longer range and improved safety, are widely seen as the next big leap. Several companies, including major Japanese and American manufacturers, are preparing commercial launches within the next five years. If successful, solid-state technology could be a turning point, positioning early adopters at the forefront of the industry and accelerating global EV adoption.

However, the rise of EVs has exposed a critical geopolitical vulnerability: mineral supply chains. Key battery materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese are concentrated in a handful of countries, creating new dependencies and competition. Latin America’s Lithium Triangle – consisting of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia – controls more than half of the world’s lithium reserves. Indonesia has become a major player in nickel production, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains the dominant source of cobalt. This concentration has forced global powers to redesign their diplomatic and economic strategies, seeking long-term partnerships to secure stable access to minerals.

Countries like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Türkiye are emerging as important actors in the mineral and logistics chain. Azerbaijan’s growing interest in critical minerals and its role as a transport hub on the Middle Corridor offer new opportunities for connecting Central Asian resources to global markets. Kazakhstan’s vast mineral base and partnerships with Western and Asian companies further strengthen regional importance. These developments show that EV-related supply chains are not only technological but also geopolitical, changing the role of countries traditionally outside the automotive spotlight.

Beyond cars, battery technologies are transforming global energy markets. Improved battery storage enables more reliable integration of wind and solar power into national grids, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and enhancing energy security. Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are investing heavily in battery storage projects to support large-scale renewable energy production. China and the United States are competing to develop next-generation grid storage technologies, viewing them as essential to future national power systems.

In the consumer market, EV affordability is becoming a decisive factor. China’s low-cost EV boom – particularly the emergence of compact city models – has disrupted global pricing structures and placed pressure on Western manufacturers to innovate faster and reduce costs. The United States and Europe are responding with new tariffs, incentives for domestic production and attempts to attract Asian battery producers to build factories locally. This competition is reshaping global trade rules and industrial policies, sometimes creating tensions between major economies.

Meanwhile, automakers are integrating artificial intelligence, autonomous driving systems and new digital services into EV platforms, turning cars into connected devices and expanding revenue models. Software-defined vehicles – where updates and features are delivered digitally – are expected to create a new era of competition, where tech companies and automakers converge.

The transformation driven by electric vehicles and battery technologies is more than an industrial shift – it is a redefinition of global power dynamics. The countries that secure mineral resources, master battery innovation, build resilient supply chains and invest in clean energy infrastructure will set the pace of the twenty-first-century economy.

OneClickDIY, an online retailer of premium insulation and DIY supplies, has released a comprehensive guide detailing how homeowners can qualify for up to $3,200 in federal tax credits through DIY spray foam insulation projects. The guide addresses growing concerns about winter heating costs, which are projected to increase by 7.6 percent this heating season, according to recent energy market analyses.

The new resource comes as homeowners face mounting energy expenses and seek practical solutions to reduce heating bills. Industry data indicates that typical homes lose between 25 and 33 percent of their heat through inadequately insulated walls and roofs, making insulation improvements a critical consideration for household budgets. The guide specifically focuses on how DIY spray foam insulation projects can qualify for the Federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, also known as the 25C tax credit.

Under current federal tax provisions, homeowners can claim up to $1,200 annually for qualified insulation and air sealing materials, representing 30 percent of project costs. The broader energy efficiency credit allows for a maximum of $3,200 per year when combined with other qualifying improvements. Spray Foam Insulation materials that meet Energy Star requirements are eligible for this credit, making DIY installation projects particularly attractive for cost-conscious homeowners.

“Rising energy costs have prompted many homeowners to explore the benefits of spray foam insulation for homes, and the availability of federal tax credits makes these improvements even more accessible,” said a spokesperson from OneClickDIY. “This guide provides homeowners with the information they need to understand both the immediate tax advantages and long-term energy savings associated with DIY spray foam projects.”

The guide examines the dual functionality of spray foam as both an insulator and air sealant, addressing two major sources of energy loss in residential structures. It includes detailed comparisons of DIY kit costs against potential energy savings and tax benefits, helping homeowners make informed decisions about their insulation investments. The resource also covers proper installation techniques, safety considerations, and documentation requirements for claiming tax credits.

OneClickDIY has positioned the guide as part of its commitment to supporting the DIY community with educational resources and authentic products. As the only authorized reseller of Stanley insulation products in the United States, and an authorized distributor for brands including Kraken Bond, Sprayman, and Akfix, the company maintains a comprehensive inventory of spray foam insulation kits and related materials.

The release of this guide reflects broader industry trends toward energy-efficient home improvements. With heating and cooling accounting for approximately 50 percent of typical home energy consumption, proper insulation represents one of the most effective strategies for reducing utility costs and improving home comfort.

OneClickDIY specializes in providing DIY spray foam and sealant kits for professionals and homeowners. The company offers a comprehensive range of products, including DIY spray foam insulation kits, two-component spray foam systems, caulks, sealants, adhesives, and specialty installation tools. As an authorized retailer for multiple premium brands, OneClickDIY ensures product authenticity and provides expert support for insulation and sealing projects.

To meet its carbon neutrality goal, Korea can continue to encourage co-operation across multiple sectors through clear implementation plans and greater co-ordination, according to a new Energy Policy Review by the IEA.

Korea’s Carbon Neutrality Act in 2021 set a legally binding goal for reaching net zero emissions by 2050, making it one of the first IEA Member countries to put such an objective into law. It also set a 2030 emissions reduction target as a milestone on the path to its carbon neutrality goal. In recent years, Korea has achieved strong economic growth while also stabilising and slightly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from their 2018 peak. Yet fully decoupling emissions from economic activity remains a challenge, as Korea relies on coal for more than a quarter of its electricity generation, according to the report.

Demand for electricity in Korea is set to be driven by a combination of factors, including the rapid electrification of the buildings, transport and industry sectors – alongside projected growth in power consumption from air conditioning, the semiconductor industry and data centres. In this context, the new IEA report highlights the need for significant investment in diversified zero- and low-emissions electricity generation, robust grid infrastructure and effective market arrangements. It notes that reform of the wholesale electricity market could help attract additional investment and deliver efficient price signals.

The share of renewables in Korea’s electricity mix almost doubled in the past five years but remains the lowest among IEA Member countries, reflecting limited land availability, a high proportion of forested areas and public opposition to new infrastructure developments. Addressing these barriers will require robust planning and a clearer national strategy for public engagement. Energy storage will play an important role as Korea works to expand the deployment of renewables. Recent steps to establish a market for energy storage services are promising, with further development needed to mobilise investment and integrate storage effectively into electricity market system operations.

Korea was among the first IEA Member countries to establish a hydrogen roadmap in 2019, with an emphasis on the transport, building and power sectors. Widespread adoption of low-emissions hydrogen remains a key goal. However, greater clarity on policy regarding the role of hydrogen in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and heavy-duty transport can help to accelerate the adoption of low-emissions hydrogen. Korea should also create clear and transparent rules for building, owning and operating hydrogen infrastructure, according to the IEA report.

Korea’s Emissions Trading System remains a cornerstone of its climate policy, covering about 80% of national emissions. However, low prices and limited liquidity hinder its effectiveness. Increasing the volume of auctioned allowances, enabling broader market participation and introducing a market stability mechanism would improve price discovery and strengthen alignment with climate targets.

The report finds that positive institutional reforms are underway and should be carried forward to completion to realise their full benefits. The establishment of the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment (MCEE) can enhance coordination across sectors and focus national efforts on renewables. Establishing an independent regulator responsible for electricity, natural gas and hydrogen markets would strengthen transparency, ensure market-based pricing and improve consumer protection, the report finds.

Korea’s impressive industrial and economic strengths – spanning heavy industry, semiconductors, advanced batteries, consumer electronics and nuclear technology – position the country as a global leader in innovation and manufacturing. Leveraging these capabilities presents an opportunity to create a virtuous circle that reinforces domestic energy policy objectives, bolsters industrial competitiveness, and advances Korea’s international economic and climate ambitions. By aligning energy transition strategies with its industrial expertise, Korea can drive sustainable growth, enhance export potential and contribute meaningfully to international decarbonisation efforts.

The goal is to reduce costs, improve safety, and accelerate the deployment of the renewable energy infrastructure.","There is growing attention on the links between artificial intelligence and increased energy demands. But while the power-hungry data centers being built to support AI could potentially stress electricity grids, increase customer prices and service interruptions, and generally slow the transition to clean energy, the use of artificial intelligence can also help the energy transition.

For example, use of AI is reducing energy consumption and associated emissions in buildings, transportation, and industrial processes. In addition, AI is helping to optimize the design and siting of new wind and solar installations and energy storage facilities.

On electric power grids, using AI algorithms to control operations is helping to increase efficiency and reduce costs, integrate the growing share of renewables, and even predict when key equipment needs servicing to prevent failure and possible blackouts. AI can help grid planners schedule investments in generation, energy storage, and other infrastructure that will be needed in the future. AI is also helping researchers discover or design novel materials for nuclear reactors, batteries, and electrolyzers.

Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are actively investigating aspects of those and other opportunities for AI to support the clean energy transition. At its 2025 research conference, MITEI announced the Data Center Power Forum, a targeted research effort for MITEI member companies interested in addressing the challenges of data center power demand.

Controlling real-time operations

Customers generally rely on receiving a continuous supply of electricity, and grid operators get help from AI to make that happen — while optimizing the storage and distribution of energy from renewable sources at the same time.

But with more installation of solar and wind farms — both of which provide power in smaller amounts, and intermittently — and the growing threat of weather events and cyberattacks, ensuring reliability is getting more complicated. “That’s exactly where AI can come into the picture,” explains Anuradha Annaswamy, a senior research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and director of MIT’s Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory. “Essentially, you need to introduce a whole information infrastructure to supplement and complement the physical infrastructure.”

The electricity grid is a complex system that requires meticulous control on time scales ranging from decades all the way down to microseconds. The challenge can be traced to the basic laws of power physics: electricity supply must equal electricity demand at every instant, or generation can be interrupted. In past decades, grid operators generally assumed that generation was fixed — they could count on how much electricity each large power plant would produce — while demand varied over time in a fairly predictable way. As a result, operators could commission specific power plants to run as needed to meet demand the next day. If some outages occurred, specially designated units would start up as needed to make up the shortfall.

Today and in the future, that matching of supply and demand must still happen, even as the number of small, intermittent sources of generation grows and weather disturbances and other threats to the grid increase. AI algorithms provide a means of achieving the complex management of information needed to forecast within just a few hours which plants should run while also ensuring that the frequency, voltage, and other characteristics of the incoming power are as required for the grid to operate properly.

Moreover, AI can make possible new ways of increasing supply or decreasing demand at times when supplies on the grid run short. As Annaswamy points out, the battery in your electric vehicle (EV), as well as the one charged up by solar panels or wind turbines, can — when needed — serve as a source of extra power to be fed into the grid. And given real-time price signals, EV owners can choose to shift charging from a time when demand is peaking and prices are high to a time when demand and therefore prices are both lower. In addition, new smart thermostats can be set to allow the indoor temperature to drop or rise — a range defined by the customer — when demand on the grid is peaking. And data centers themselves can be a source of demand flexibility: selected AI calculations could be delayed as needed to smooth out peaks in demand. Thus, AI can provide many opportunities to fine-tune both supply and demand as needed.

In addition, AI makes possible “predictive maintenance.” Any downtime is costly for the company and threatens shortages for the customers served. AI algorithms can collect key performance data during normal operation and, when readings veer off from that normal, the system can alert operators that something might be going wrong, giving them a chance to intervene. That capability prevents equipment failures, reduces the need for routine inspections, increases worker productivity, and extends the lifetime of key equipment.

Annaswamy stresses that “figuring out how to architect this new power grid with these AI components will require many different experts to come together.” She notes that electrical engineers, computer scientists, and energy economists “will have to rub shoulders with enlightened regulators and policymakers to make sure that this is not just an academic exercise, but will actually get implemented. All the different stakeholders have to learn from each other. And you need guarantees that nothing is going to fail. You can’t have blackouts.”

Using AI to help plan investments in infrastructure for the future

Grid companies constantly need to plan for expanding generation, transmission, storage, and more, and getting all the necessary infrastructure built and operating may take many years, in some cases more than a decade. So, they need to predict what infrastructure they’ll need to ensure reliability in the future. “It’s complicated because you have to forecast over a decade ahead of time what to build and where to build it,” says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in MITEI.

One challenge with anticipating what will be needed is predicting how the future system will operate. “That’s becoming increasingly difficult,” says Deka, because more renewables are coming online and displacing traditional generators. In the past, operators could rely on “spinning reserves,” that is, generating capacity that’s not currently in use but could come online in a matter of minutes to meet any shortfall on the system. The presence of so many intermittent generators — wind and solar — means there’s now less stability and inertia built into the grid. Adding to the complication is that those intermittent generators can be built by various vendors, and grid planners may not have access to the physics-based equations that govern the operation of each piece of equipment at sufficiently fine time scales. “So, you probably don’t know exactly how it’s going to run,” says Deka.

And then there’s the weather. Determining the reliability of a proposed future energy system requires knowing what it’ll be up against in terms of weather. The future grid has to be reliable not only in everyday weather, but also during low-probability but high-risk events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, all of which are becoming more and more frequent, notes Deka. AI can help by predicting such events and even tracking changes in weather patterns due to climate change.

Deka points out another, less-obvious benefit of the speed of AI analysis. Any infrastructure development plan must be reviewed and approved, often by several regulatory and other bodies. Traditionally, an applicant would develop a plan, analyze its impacts, and submit the plan to one set of reviewers. After making any requested changes and repeating the analysis, the applicant would resubmit a revised version to the reviewers to see if the new version was acceptable. AI tools can speed up the required analysis so the process moves along more quickly. Planners can even reduce the number of times a proposal is rejected by using large language models to search regulatory publications and summarize what’s important for a proposed infrastructure installation.

Harnessing AI to discover and exploit advanced materials needed for the energy transition

“Use of AI for materials development is booming right now,” says Ju Li, MIT’s Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. He notes two main directions.

First, AI makes possible faster physics-based simulations at the atomic scale. The result is a better atomic-level understanding of how composition, processing, structure, and chemical reactivity relate to the performance of materials. That understanding provides design rules to help guide the development and discovery of novel materials for energy generation, storage, and conversion needed for a sustainable future energy system.

And second, AI can help guide experiments in real time as they take place in the lab. Li explains: “AI assists us in choosing the best experiment to do based on our previous experiments and — based on literature searches — makes hypotheses and suggests new experiments.”

He describes what happens in his own lab. Human scientists interact with a large language model, which then makes suggestions about what specific experiments to do next. The human researcher accepts or modifies the suggestion, and a robotic arm responds by setting up and performing the next step in the experimental sequence, synthesizing the material, testing the performance, and taking images of samples when appropriate. Based on a mix of literature knowledge, human intuition, and previous experimental results, AI thus coordinates active learning that balances the goals of reducing uncertainty with improving performance. And, as Li points out, “AI has read many more books and papers than any human can, and is thus naturally more interdisciplinary.”

The outcome, says Li, is both better design of experiments and speeding up the “work flow.” Traditionally, the process of developing new materials has required synthesizing the precursors, making the material, testing its performance and characterizing the structure, making adjustments, and repeating the same series of steps. AI guidance speeds up that process, “helping us to design critical, cheap experiments that can give us the maximum amount of information feedback,” says Li.

“Having this capability certainly will accelerate material discovery, and this may be the thing that can really help us in the clean energy transition,” he concludes. “AI [has the potential to] lubricate the material-discovery and optimization process, perhaps shortening it from decades, as in the past, to just a few years.”

MITEI’s contributions

At MIT, researchers are working on various aspects of the opportunities described above. In projects supported by MITEI, teams are using AI to better model and predict disruptions in plasma flows inside fusion reactors — a necessity in achieving practical fusion power generation. Other MITEI-supported teams are using AI-powered tools to interpret regulations, climate data, and infrastructure maps in order to achieve faster, more adaptive electric grid planning. AI-guided development of advanced materials continues, with one MITEI project using AI to optimize solar cells and thermoelectric materials.

Other MITEI researchers are developing robots that can learn maintenance tasks based on human feedback, including physical intervention and verbal instructions. The goal is to reduce costs, improve safety, and accelerate the deployment of the renewable energy infrastructure. And MITEI-funded work continues on ways to reduce the energy demand of data centers, from designing more efficient computer chips and computing algorithms to rethinking the architectural design of the buildings, for example, to increase airflow so as to reduce the need for air conditioning.

In addition to providing leadership and funding for many research projects, MITEI acts as a convenor, bringing together interested parties to consider common problems and potential solutions. In May 2025, MITEI’s annual spring symposium — titled “AI and energy: Peril and promise” — brought together AI and energy experts from across academia, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations to explore AI as both a problem and a potential solution for the clean energy transition. At the close of the symposium, William H. Green, director of MITEI and Hoyt C. Hottel Professor in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering, noted, “The challenge of meeting data center energy demand and of unlocking the potential benefits of AI to the energy transition is now a research priority for MITEI.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202511/power-lines.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 09:01:19.571267

BACKGROUND The CWA applies to “navigable waters,” which is defined as “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,” but the CWA does not further define WOTUS.
The Proposed Rule continues the long-standing exclusion of prior converted cropland, but clarifies that the exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland.
Eliminations The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters.
However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.","On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) in the Federal Register to update several regulatory definitions defining “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

The Proposed Rule is a culmination of decades of agency and judicial process that at times narrowed and expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over our nation’s waters. Driven by the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (Sackett), the Trump Administration is poised to change the definition of WOTUS to limit federal jurisdiction. These changes are intended to respect State and Tribal authority and promote regulatory certainty and clarity.

As further explained below, the Proposed Rule would clarify the definition of WOTUS by defining “continuous surface connection,” “relatively permanent,” and “tributaries,” and would clarify several exemptions under the CWA. Additionally, the Proposed Rule would add a new exemption for groundwater and would eliminate interstate waters that don’t themselves independently qualify as WOTUS from federal jurisdiction.

EPA and the Corps are also inviting comments on alternative approaches and additional revisions to the WOTUS definition and its implementation. Comments must be received on or before January 5, 2026.

BACKGROUND

The CWA applies to “navigable waters,” which is defined as “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,” but the CWA does not further define WOTUS. This lack of statutory definition has resulted in ambiguity, protracted rulemaking, and decades of litigation over the breadth of WOTUS.

Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the definition of WOTUS in Sackett. The Court adopted a narrow interpretation of WOTUS, holding that the CWA’s use of “waters” encompasses “only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water ‘forming geographical features,’” such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes. Similarly, Sackett concluded that the Agencies’ definition of “adjacent,” used to determine whether a wetland constituted a jurisdictional water under the CWA, was too broad, and affirmed that the “continuous surface connection” test is the appropriate standard. Shortly thereafter, the Corps and EPA under the Biden Administration promulgated regulations conforming the regulatory definition of WOTUS to the Sackett decision (Amended 2023 Rule). EPA and the Corps are now proposing to revise the definition again to address concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including assertions that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court’s interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction and implementation-related issues.

For additional background and history of the WOTUS saga, refer to Van Ness Feldman’s past alerts and notices.[1]

KEY CHANGES

Definitions:

The most significant proposed changes would revise the definitions of two terms that guide whether a water is a WOTUS or not: “relatively permanent” and “continuous surface connection.” The rule also clarifies the definition of “tributaries.” Each term plays an important role in determining whether a particular water qualifies as a WOTUS.

WOTUS includes (1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas; (2) most impoundments of “waters of the United States;” (3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments; (4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries; and (5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary.

Relatively Permanent. The Proposed Rule would define “relatively permanent” to mean “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” The relatively permanent definition applies to tributaries, lakes and ponds, and adjacent wetlands.

With the addition of “at least during the wet season,” the Agencies propose to add a temporal element to the test. “Wet season” would be defined using existing agency tools, and quantitatively as the point at which “precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration,” and would vary by geographic region and ecotype. Significantly, water must stand or flow for the entirety of the wet season to qualify as “relatively permanent;” intermittent flow, or longer flow not occurring during the wet season do not qualify as relatively permanent waters. The Agencies are soliciting comments on alternative methods that could better define the wet season given site and region-specific factors.

Continuous surface connection. The Proposed Rule would define a continuous surface connection as one “having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.”

EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season. The Agencies explain that this is meant to limit the scope of jurisdictional wetlands by suggesting that even if a wetland is more broadly delineated, only those portions of the wetland that have surface water that abuts or touches a jurisdictional water during the wet season are under federal jurisdiction.

Tributaries. The Proposed Rule would redefine tributaries as “bod[ies] of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.”

This definition expressly excludes “a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through [natural or artificial] feature[s]… if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow.” However, tributaries do include natural, man-altered, and man-made waterbodies, such as rivers, streams, ditches, canals, lakes, ponds, and impoundments,” as long as they connect to a downstream traditionally navigable water. Tributaries may connect through non-jurisdictional features, so long as those features convey relatively permanent flow.

Exclusions

The Proposed Rule would modify three existing jurisdictional exclusions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and ditches, and adds a new exclusion related to groundwater.

Waste water systems. The Proposed Rule would continue an existing exclusion for waste treatment systems, and define “waste treatment systems” as “including all components of a waste treatment system designed to meet the requirements of the [CWA], including lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).”

By adding this definition, the Proposed Rule appears to expand the scope of the exclusion to include all components of a waste treatment system. The Preamble of the Proposed Rule acknowledges that a cooling pond constructed within a WOTUS would be excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction provided it complies with CWA requirements.

Prior Converted Cropland. The Proposed Rule continues the long-standing exclusion of prior converted cropland, but clarifies that the exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland. The Agencies propose that prior converted cropland is considered abandoned if it is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at least once in the immediately preceding five years. The Proposed Rule also explains that agricultural uses can include myriad conservation and non-extractive uses, providing that the Agencies’ new list of agricultural uses “may not be obvious to Corps field staff,” such that the Corps can rely on public or private documentation that the land is being used in accordance with the agricultural uses set forth in the rule.

Ditches. The Proposed Rule would clarify the types of ditches that are excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction, explaining that non navigable ditches that are constructed or excavated “entirely in dry land” are not WOTUS. The Proposed Rule explains that ditches that channel or relocate jurisdictional tributaries maintain their jurisdictional status if the tributary continues to meet the regulatory definition of a tributary.

New exception for groundwater. The Proposed Rule explains that groundwater has never been interpreted as WOTUS, explaining that groundwater is by nature not navigable. However, “subsurface expressions of groundwater” that emerge from the ground and become baseflow in a relatively permanent stream are not subject to the exclusion and would continue to be subject to federal jurisdiction if they otherwise meet the requirements of a WOTUS.

Eliminations

The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters. Eliminating these triggers would remove lakes and streams that straddle state borders, that do not themselves independently meet the regulatory definition of a WOTUS. The Agencies reason that this has been a consistent source of litigation, reads out “navigable” from the statute, and is ultimately not supported by Sackett or Rapanos v. United States (Rapanos). The Proposed Rule provides that nonjurisdictional interstate waters are appropriately regulated by the “States and Tribes under their sovereign authorities.”

Additionally, the Proposed Rule would restrict mosaic wetlands to the individual wetland segments, which previously together constituted a single wetland comprising the hydrologically connected segments. In particular, this has significant implications for jurisdictional determinations in Alaska, where permafrost wetlands have long been regulated under the mosaic wetland interpretation.

Additionally, the Agencies are seeking comment regarding whether to adopt a USDA definition of wetland under the Food Security Act that expressly excludes certain permafrost wetlands in lands with high agricultural potential in Alaska.

Implications

The Proposed Rule would limit the scope of federal jurisdiction over the nation’s waters and correspondingly reduce the federal regulatory burden and compliance issues for work done in and near waters that are no longer considered jurisdictional. We would anticipate a significant reduction in the number of Section 404 permits and associated CWA 401 water quality certifications. However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.

Once finalized, additional litigation on the final rule is almost certain to occur.

Furthermore, irrespective of this rulemaking, states and Tribes will likely use their own regulatory authority to fill the gap left by Sackett and the finalized rule. States, including Washington, have ongoing rulemaking processes to further develop their regulatory authority over state waters.

The awards, announced at SC25, the international conference for high-performance computing, recognised work on tsunami forecasting and climate modelling that could reshape how organisations approach disaster response and environmental planning.

Real-time tsunami prediction systems

The University of Texas at Austin, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the University of California San Diego won the Gordon Bell Prize for developing a digital twin that issues real-time probabilistic tsunami forecasts based on a full-physics model. Applied to the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest, the system combines real-time sensor data with full-physics modelling and uncertainty quantification.

Tasks that would normally require 50 years on 512 graphics processing units (GPUs) were completed in just 0.2 seconds on the Alps and Perlmutter supercomputers.

Omar Ghattas, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, says: ""For the first time, real-time sensor data can be rapidly combined with full-physics modelling and uncertainty quantification to give people a chance to act before disaster strikes.""

Omar notes the framework ""provides a basis for predictive, physics-based emergency-response systems across various hazards"".

Kilometre-scale global climate modelling

A second team from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, German Climate Computing Centre, Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, Jülich Supercomputing Centre, ETH Zurich, the University of Hamburg and Nvidia won the Gordon Bell Prize for Climate Modelling for their work on the ICON Earth system model.

The ICON model simulates the entire Earth's systems at kilometre-scale resolution, capturing the flow of energy, water and carbon through the atmosphere, oceans and land. Running on Jupiter, Europe's first exascale supercomputer capable of performing a quintillion calculations per second and hosted at Jülich Supercomputing Centre, the model achieved what researchers describe as a world record in global climate simulation.

The system can simulate approximately 146 days every 24 hours, enabling climate projections decades forward with efficiency that traditional models cannot match.

Daniel Klocke, Computational Infrastructure and Model Development Group Leader at Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, says integrating all components of the Earth system in ICON ""at a resolution of 1 kilometre allows researchers to see full global Earth system information on local scales and learn more about the implications of future warming for both people and ecosystems"".

Hardware infrastructure enabling discoveries

The research teams used three supercomputers for their work. Alps, hosted at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, is powered by more than 10,000 Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, which combine a central processing unit with a graphics processing unit on a single module. Perlmutter, hosted at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center in California, runs on Nvidia accelerated computing hardware.

Thomas Schulthess, Director of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, says: ""At CSCS, we don't just support open science – we accelerate it.""

Thomas adds that the work by this year's five Gordon Bell finalists ""stand as irrefutable proof: without the Alps supercomputer, these scientific discoveries simply would not exist"".

Additional computational breakthroughs recognised

Five teams were shortlisted for the prizes, with projects spanning climate modelling, materials science, fluid simulation, geophysics and electronic design.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Nvidia developed ORBIT-2, an AI foundation model for weather and climate downscaling that creates high-resolution data from lower-resolution sources, enabling teams to capture localised phenomena, including urban heat islands and extreme precipitation events.

ETH Zurich developed QuaTrEx, a package of algorithms for nanoscale electronic device modelling. Running on Alps with Nvidia GH200 Superchips, the system can simulate devices with more than 45,000 atoms using 64-bit floating-point precision.

The Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Nvidia, also developed MFC, an open-source solver for fluid flow simulation used in spacecraft design. Running on Alps, the system enables simulation four times faster and with over five times greater energy efficiency than the previous benchmark.

Spencer Bryngelson, Assistant Professor in Computational Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, says the team's ""new information geometric regularisation method, combined with the Nvidia GH200 Superchip's unified virtual memory and mixed-precision capabilities, has substantially improved the efficiency of simulating complex computational fluid flows, enabling us to simulate rocket engine plumes at unprecedented scales"".",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/1e5790b1c3db36fbb91d5d3fc6781872:8c7ac87ff029ea83d0e4baa506fa3f58/gordon-bell-prize.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:04:01.393823

""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""","A recent study led to the development of a comprehensive framework that policymakers can use to retire America's coal plants forever.

The study, published in Nature Energy, was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A Tech Xplore article said that the goal was to develop a strategy to speed up the country's transition away from coal power.

Although many coal plants have already shut down, over 100 remain active with no retirement plans, per the outlet. The plants' continued operation could make it more difficult to meet carbon pollution goals meant to protect air quality and health.

But shutting down coal plant operations can be more complicated than one might realize.

""Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem,"" said study lead Sidney Gathrid, for whom the project started as a senior thesis. ""There's no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.""

The researchers' framework has two major points that policymakers could use to inform their decisions.

One is the ""contextual retirement vulnerability"" score, which measures a coal plant's likelihood of shutting down. The other is ""retirement archetypes"" — patterns that explain why plants may close, such as economic, health-based, and political factors.

Burning coal can have a variety of negative impacts on human health. For example, the pollutants from burning coal can lead to respiratory concerns, lung disease, and brain damage, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Coal power plants can also affect the environment. The Union of Concerned Scientists stated that ash may contaminate waterways, impacting recreation and drinking supplies.

That makes this new framework an exciting opportunity to close the coal plants that have had lasting impacts on people and the planet.

Some research suggests that coal use in the U.S. has reached its lowest since the 1960s. Another study discovered that most coal plants cost more to maintain than it would to replace them with wind or solar.

""What's exciting is that this framework doesn't just describe which plants might retire,"" said senior author and professor Grace Wu. ""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""

The scientists involved in the study believe the framework could even be adapted for other energy policy efforts. Wu said: ""It's flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/accelerated-coal-plant-retirementimage-rec5TCPTGenVo218L.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 07:58:45.811120

Sign up to get it in your inbox.

In early November, Texas-based New Era Energy & Digital announced plans to build a “hyperscale,” meaning massive, AI-processing data center complex in Lea County, New Mexico, the epicenter of the Permian Basin oil and gas drilling boom. The campus will be so big, and use so much power, that, if and when it is built, it will come with its own nuclear and gas power plants, with a mind-blowing combined generation capacity of about 7 gigawatts. That’s like piling the West’s largest nuclear and natural gas plants — Palo Verde and Gila River, both near Phoenix — on top of one another, and then adding another 800 megawatts. That kind of power could electrify something like 5.3 million homes, though these power plants’ output presumably will all go toward more pressing requirements: processing movie streaming, doomscrolling, social media posting and, especially, AI-related activities.

Despite the enormity of this proposal, it has received very little news coverage. This is not because anyone is trying to keep it secret, but rather because such announcements have become so common that it’s hardly worth mentioning every new one. New Era’s hyperscale server farm and others like it are still a long way from generating and then devouring their own electricity. But even if only a fraction of the current proposals succeed, they will transform the West’s power grid, its landscapes and its economies as significantly as the post-World War II Big Buildup, when huge coal plants and hydroelectric dams sprouted across the region to deliver power to burgeoning cities via high-voltage transmission lines.

In fact, this transformation is already underway. A new report from the nonprofit NEXT 10 and University of California Riverside found that, in 2023, data centers in California pulled 10.82 terawatt-hours of electricity — 1 terawatt equals 1 trillion watts — from the state’s grid, or about enough to power 1 million U.S. households. This resulted in about 2.4 million tons of carbon emissions, even with California’s relatively clean energy mix. (On more fossil fuel-reliant grids, the emissions would have been twice that, or even more.) These same centers directly and indirectly consumed about 13.2 billion gallons of water for cooling and electricity generation. In Silicon Valley, more than 50 data centers accounted for about 60% of one electricity provider’s total load, prompting the utility to raise its customers rates to fund the transmission and substation upgrades and new battery energy storage the facilities required.

These facilities are also colonizing cities and towns far from Big Tech’s Silicon Valley epicenter. Over 100 data centers — structures that resemble big-box stores overflowing with row after row of computer processors — have already sprung up in Phoenix-area business parks, and the planned new ones could increase Arizona’s total power load by 300% over current levels, according to utilities. Recently, Arizona Public Service announced it would keep burning coal at the Four Corners Power Plant beyond its scheduled 2031 retirement to help meet this growing demand.

Data center developments around the West include:

NorthWestern Energy signed on to provide up to 1,000 MW of power — or nearly all of the utility’s generating capacity — to Quantica Infrastructure’s AI data center under development in Montana’s Yellowstone County.

The 290-mile Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission project under development in Idaho and Oregon was initially designed to serve about 800,000 PacifiCorp utility customers. But in October it was revealed that the line now will deliver all of its electricity to a single industrial customer in Oregon, most likely a new data center.

In September, an NV Energy executive told a gathering in Las Vegas that tech firms are asking the utility to supply up to 22,000 megawatts of electricity for planned data centers. Since the utility has largely moved away from coal, this new load would likely be met by generation from existing and planned natural gas facilities, along with proposed utility-scale solar installations.

Xcel Energy expects to spend about $22 billion in the next 15 years to meet new data centers’ projected power demand in Colorado, potentially doubling or even tripling legacy customers’ rates. Xcel and the state’s public utilities commission are currently working to reverse the planned closure of a coal plant due to projected data center-associated electricity shortages.

Wyoming officials are doing their best to lure data centers and cryptocurrency firms to the state, and it seems to be working. This summer, Tallgrass proposed building an 1,800 MW data center, along with dedicated gas-fired and renewable power facilities, near Cheyenne. It would add to Meta’s facility in Cheyenne and the 1,200 MW natural gas-powered Prometheus Hyperscale data center under development in Evanston. Observers say electricity demand from these centers could transform the physical and regulatory utility landscape and potentially drive up costs for “legacy” customers.

New Mexico utilities are struggling to meet growing demand from an increasing number of data centers while also complying with the state’s Energy Transition Act’s requirements for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Doña Ana County approved tax incentives for Project Jupiter, a proposed $165 billion data center campus in Santa Teresa in the southeastern corner of New Mexico. Developers have indicated they plan on building dedicated power generation, though they have not yet disclosed the energy sources.

Numerous companies are eyeing Delta, Utah, as a site for new data centers, drawn by the area’s relatively cheap land, existing agricultural water rights and the fact that it’s home to the Intermountain Power Project, a colossal coal plant built during the original Big Buildup in the years after World War II. The plant is scheduled to be converted to run on natural gas and, ultimately, hydrogen, but Utah lawmakers want at least one of its units to continue to burn coal. They just need a buyer for the dirty power it would produce, and data centers could fit the bill. Fibernet MercuryDelta is looking to construct the 20 million-square-foot Delta Gigasite there, and Creekstone Energy plans to manage 10 gigawatts of capacity there, with power coming from coal, solar and natural gas.

The Western power grid is interconnected but also divided into 38 balancing authorities, or grid operators. Nearly every one of them is expected to see an increase in data center-driven demand over the next decade or so as the Big Digital Buildup gains steam, and few of them are currently equipped to meet that demand. In fact, the North American Electricity Reliability Corp. warned this month that growing data center-driven power demand is increasing the risk of outages this winter in parts of the West. Therefore, many of the largest data centers are going to need to generate their own power, while utilities also will have to scramble to add generating capacity and associated infrastructure as quickly as possible to serve the region’s on-grid facilities. The costs of that new infrastructure will be borne by each utility’s ratepayers.

How will the needed power be generated?

There’s simply no way utilities and developers can meet the projected demand with solar and wind, alone. So, utilities are already making plans to keep existing coal plants running past previously scheduled retirement dates, and to build new natural gas plants and even nuclear reactors. Yes, nukes: Google, Switch, Amazon, Open AI and Meta are all looking to power proposed facilities with the new — so new they have yet to be developed — crop of small, modular and advanced reactors, if and when they are finally up and running.

Can data centers be “sustainable”?

These developments will have environmental consequences, some more than others. Fossil fuel burning feeds climate change and pollutes the air, and oil and gas drilling and coal mining ravage landscapes; utility-scale solar and wind facilities can harm wildlife habitat and often require hundreds of miles of new transmission lines to move the power around; and nuclear power comes with unique safety hazards and a nagging radioactive waste problem, while the uranium mining and milling industry risks reenacting its deadly Cold War legacy. Even a facility that gets all of its power from solar and batteries is still using resources that, without the extra demand, would otherwise be replacing fossil fuels on the grid. And, unless it has a closed-loop air-cooled system, the data center will still consume water for cooling, usually from municipal drinking water systems.

Wyoming-based Prometheus Hyperscale has made waves with its ambitious and seemingly visionary talk of building “sustainable” data centers with dedicated clean energy generation, water recycling and efficient cooling systems that would capitalize on the cold in the Northern Rockies. It’s even talked about harnessing the heat from the servers to warm greenhouses and shrimp-farming operations. Maybe, one day, the power will be supplemented by nuclear micro-reactors. But so far, the company’s walk is not exactly matching its talk. In the beginning, at least, the facility will run on natural gas, and Prometheus says it will offset carbon emissions by paying another company to capture and sequester carbon dioxide from biofuel plants in Nebraska.

Is resistance futile?

Resistance to the imminent server farm tsunami and its outsized energy and water use is widespread, but because these are local projects considered on local levels, battling them can feel a bit like playing whack-a-mole. After Tucson-area residents defeated the city’s plan to annex the proposed Project Blue data center, which would have enabled it to use treated wastewater for cooling, the developers simply moved the project into the county and planned to use an air-cooling system, which requires less water but more energy. When opposition continued, the firm committed to investing in enough renewable energy on Tucson Electric Power’s grid to offset all of its electricity use.

Also working against the resistance is the fact that many local governments and utilities actually welcome the onslaught. Data centers can bring jobs and tax revenues — assuming the state, county or municipality doesn’t exempt them from taxes — to economically distraught areas. Meanwhile, utilities are champing at the bit to sell more of their product and raise rates to pay for the needed additional infrastructure. When announcing all the data centers headed for Nevada, NV Energy executive Jeff Brigger noted that the utility is “excited to serve this load.”

While much of the opposition to data centers is based on their environmental impacts and the effects they might have on utility rates and on the communities where they’re built, the notion of AI itself is also a factor. It’s one thing to see a lot of water or power used to grow food, for instance, but quite another to see coal power plants continue to run simply so that a computer can write a high school essay or answer an inane question or draw a picture or even serve as a companion of sorts. To be fair, AI does have potentially significant and positive applications, such as diagnosing medical conditions and crunching large quantities of data to find, say, possible cures for cancer or solutions to geopolitical problems.

But before it goes about changing the world, maybe AI ought to start with itself and figure out how to do its thing without using so much energy and water.

Representing a $3.2 billion investment the facility to be located in the city of St. Thomas would also be the first large-scale, low-emission synthetic graphite plant in North America.

Expected to employ about 300 people initially, the Vianode operation could possibly create 1,000 jobs once at full capacity.

“Today marks an important step towards a resilient North American battery supply chain,” said Burkhard Straube, CEO of Vianode. “Ontario and the city of St. Thomas have been strong partners from day one, and Via TWO will bring industrial-scale, low-emission graphite to market through a phased build-out that supports customers, communities, and the clean energy transition.”

As demand for graphite grows this Vianode facility would help Ontario and Canada as a whole to secure domestic supply of a key commodity used in manufacturing, defense, and energy, marking a significant step towards building a critical mineral supply chain in Ontario.

The Hon. Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario, said, “Today’s announcement is a historic milestone for southwestern Ontario and a major win for workers, creating good-paying manufacturing jobs today and for generations to come. We’re proud to welcome Vianode to St. Thomas as we strengthen our province’s competitive advantage in a critical industry and build the most competitive, resilient, self-reliant economy in the G7.”

Synthetic graphite is used to form a key component of lithium-ion batteries — the anode, and it is essential to semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defense systems, and steel production.

Through the use of proprietary technology, Vianode produces high-performance synthetic anode graphite with up to 90% lower carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional methods.

According to Vianode, ground preparation works are underway to enable start of production in 2028. Planned expansions would bring the Ontario plant’s total capacity to as many as 150,000 tons of synthetic graphite annually.

“Vianode’s decision is a clear signal that Ontario remains a dependable and competitive partner for business growth,” said Khawar Nasim, CEO of Invest Ontario. “Investing today demands clear strategy and steady navigation through a changing economic landscape, especially for landmark projects of this scale. We’re proud to have worked with Vianode along the way to help it enter a new market and grow with confidence in Ontario.”

Invest Ontario has been working closely with Vianode from the early stages of its site selection process.

“What the manufacturers here really want, and really need, is just certainty,” said MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing at the trade group American Clean Power. What they got this year was ​“policy whiplash,” he said, which has caused the Biden-era drumbeat of clean-energy manufacturing announcements to morph into a chorus of cancellations, per data from Atlas Public Policy.

But T1 nonetheless is staking a claim to homegrown American solar energy and making the case that it’s still lucrative. The firm has plowed ahead this year, signing deals for U.S.-made polysilicon and U.S. made steel frames and preparing to build its own solar-cell fabrication facility.

Gold pointed to the booming demand for solar, which has become the biggest source of new power plant capacity getting built in the U.S. today by a long shot.

“We absolutely believe that it is a great time to be making solar,” said Gold, who came to T1 in May after a career covering energy for The Wall Street Journal. ​“The main reason is we’re in the middle of this massive trend toward more electricity usage … Solar is the scalable energy resource that can produce the amount of electricity that is demanded today.”

State-of-the-art solar manufacturing in Texas

T1’s facility bustles with robots and people working side by side.

Autonomous units ferry materials around and handle the heavy lifting of pallets stacked high with finished panels. Specialized machines cut cells and string them together with electrically conductive filaments, while others sandwich rows of cells between glass, snap their frames into place, and roll them through a high-temperature curing process.

Today those frames are made out of imported aluminum, but next year T1 will replace them with U.S.-made steel frames from Nextpower, the solar equipment juggernaut formerly known as Nextracker. Dan Shugar, Nextpower’s CEO, had visited T1 shortly before I did; given Shugar’s well-known love for classic guitar rock, technicians reprogrammed the autonomous guided vehicles’ warning sounds with grooves by Santana and AC/DC. (“Because of course, AC/DC — it’s appropriate,” Gold told me.) The sounds stuck around.

The factory was running two 12-hour shifts every day, with workers watching over the robots and stepping in when necessary to correct their work. Signs listed every key notice in English, Mandarin, and Spanish, and the 1,200-person workforce reflected the diversity of the Texas metropolis.

The only production line that wasn’t operating during my visit had been geared toward smaller residential panels. T1 had paused production in response to slack demand, Gold said, and was working to adjust the line to produce panels for the booming utility-scale market instead.

Around the factory, a few clues hinted at a more nuanced backstory than the triumphal, homegrown American solar narrative that T1 leads with. Much of the production machinery sported the logo of Trina Solar, a Chinese company that ranks among the most prolific solar manufacturers in the world. At the end of the tour, we surveyed the warehouse area, where pallets of finished modules awaited shipping in Trina Solar–branded cardboard boxes.

The Chinese company, in fact, built the factory, as part of a wave of foreign investment in U.S. solar panel assembly that kicked off back in 2018, when the first Trump administration levied new tariffs on Chinese imports. Chinese investment in U.S. solar factories accelerated considerably when the Biden administration passed industrial policy that rewarded manufacturers for U.S. production and developers for installing domestically made equipment.

Within two and a half years of Biden signing the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. built enough factories to assemble all the panels it needed. The entire supply chain had not been re-shored, but it was well on its way — a remarkable turnaround for a sector long since decimated by cheaper Chinese competition. The lone exception to that collapse was First Solar, which makes a thin-film cadmium-telluride panel, in contrast to the dominant silicon-based photovoltaics; that company, too, has expanded its U.S. footprint, recently completing a factory in Louisiana and announcing a new one in South Carolina.

Even before Trump won his second election, though, bipartisan political sentiment was shifting against Chinese companies’ benefiting from federal incentives, even those that built state-of-the-art factories in the U.S. and staffed them with American workers.

Trina had constructed the Dallas factory and had just begun the laborious process of commissioning the lines when it evidently saw the writing on the wall. Trina sold the factory in December to Freyr Battery, which had tried and failed to build battery gigafactories in Norway and Georgia. The entity officially rebranded as T1 Energy in February and now is headquartered in the U.S. and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Gold demurred on the question of who approached whom with an offer. In any case, after the transaction, T1 owned the factory, which it calls G1 Dallas, and Trina retained a 13.2% stake in the company. That arrangement neatly anticipated the ​“foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules that Trump signed into law this summer: Republicans restricted clean energy tax credits from going to companies with too much ownership by Chinese companies.

“FEOC is going to be a challenge for this industry because China has dominated the solar industry for years,” Gold said. But the December transaction took the factory from a level of Chinese ownership that would violate the subsequent FEOC rules to a level ​“well below the equity cutoff,” Gold noted. ​“We were doing it before Congress spelled out what people need to do.”

Congress set the FEOC restrictions to kick in at the start of 2026, which means some domestic solar factories will, ironically, cease to qualify for the made-in-America tax credits under their current ownership structures. Santa’s sack just might hold some factories for corporations, like T1, that have made it onto the FEOC ​“nice list.”

As for the ongoing use of Trina-branded containers for shipping T1 modules, ​“there was no reason to make extra waste by trashing a bunch of boxes,” Gold said.

Domestic solar-cell supply incoming in Texas

Solar panels are the last step of the supply chain, and the one with the lowest barrier to entry: Though highly specialized and automated, the machines at T1, as at Qcells’ facility in Dalton, Georgia, are assembling components produced elsewhere. Making silicon cells requires a step change in capital and technical proficiency, as do the precursor steps of producing wafers and polysilicon ingots.

The U.S. has proved it can make solar panels that, if not economically competitive with those made in China, can get by in a protectionist trade regime that, at least for now, is still buoyed by federal incentives. Cell production is ticking up in the U.S., which currently has factories that can use them — Suniva and ES Foundry each brought about 1 gigawatt of cell capacity on line in the past year. Qcells is finishing up a 3.3-gigawatt cell-production facility in Georgia.

This constitutes an ​“orderly strategic buildout” for the domestic industry, said Shiao of American Clean Power. ​“The cell producers aren’t going to come until the module producers come … Right now, we’re starting to see that larger growth of cell production because we’ve had those years for those investment decisions to come to fruition.”

T1 is also getting in on the photovoltaic-cell action. By the end of the year, Gold said, the company expects to break ground on a $400 million cell-fabrication plant, or fab, in Rockdale, Texas, down the road from another silicon-oriented business: a major Samsung chip-fab development. The plan is to ramp up to 2.1 gigawatts of cell production by the end of 2026 and add another 3.2 gigawatts in a subsequent phase.

That’s one angle. This fall T1 also bought a minority equity stake in a fellow upstart solar manufacturer called Talon PV, which is building a 4.8-gigawatt cell fab in Baytown, Texas, and targeting production in early 2027.

A T1 deal with legacy glass producer Corning signals a further deepening of the U.S. solar supply chain. Corning announced in October that it had opened polysilicon ingot and wafer production in Michigan — the crucial precursor to cell production, and something the U.S. hasn’t had in almost a decade. Business launched on an auspicious note, as Corning has already sold 80% of all its expected production for the next five years to customers including T1.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/T1-solar-factory-lead-imate.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=dcdeccd685ed067815702ddbc8739510,N,,2025-11-25 04:57:44.847941

The Northern Indiana investment comes on the heels of Amazon Web Services’ previously announced $11 billion commitment to St. Joseph County, which at the time represented the largest capital investment in Indiana’s history. Combined, these investments total $26 billion in data center infrastructure, reflecting the unprecedented growth in demand for cloud services and the computational resources required to train and deploy sophisticated AI models.

Addressing the AI Computing Boom

The explosive growth of generative artificial intelligence technologies has created an insatiable appetite for computing power and advanced cloud infrastructure. Large language models, image generation systems, and other AI applications require massive amounts of computational resources for both training and inference operations. This surge in demand has prompted major technology companies to dramatically expand their data center capacity to meet current needs and anticipate future growth.

Amazon’s new Indiana facilities will be purpose-built to support AI workloads, leveraging AWS’s expertise in designing custom infrastructure optimized for machine learning operations. The company has developed its own specialized chips, including the Trainium processors for AI training and Inferentia chips for inference workloads, which deliver superior performance and energy efficiency compared to general-purpose processors. These custom-designed components, combined with proprietary server designs and network architecture, enable AWS to provide infrastructure that supports some of the world’s most demanding computational workloads.

The facilities will incorporate the same advanced technologies that power Project Rainier, described as the world’s largest AI supercomputer. This level of infrastructure is essential for companies and researchers working on frontier AI models that require coordinated training across thousands of specialized processors operating in parallel. By establishing this capacity in Indiana, Amazon positions the state at the forefront of AI innovation and ensures that American companies maintain competitive advantages in this strategically important technological domain.

Economic Impact and Job Creation

The economic implications of Amazon’s investment extend far beyond the direct employment figures. While the project will create 1,100 high-skilled positions in roles such as data center engineers, network specialists, engineering operations managers, and security specialists, the ripple effects throughout the regional economy will be substantial. Thousands of construction workers, electricians, fiber-optic technicians, and professionals in various support industries will find employment opportunities throughout the multi-year construction phase and ongoing operations.

Indiana Governor Mike Braun emphasized the significance of the investment for the state’s economic trajectory, noting that the project reinforces Indiana’s reputation as a business-friendly environment that attracts world-class employers. The governor highlighted that the agreement ensures energy development surplus that will deliver tangible cost savings to Indiana residents while strengthening the state’s position in both energy infrastructure and economic leadership.

According to Amazon’s track record in the state, the company has invested more than $31.3 billion in Indiana since 2010, including infrastructure development and employee compensation. This sustained investment has created more than 24,500 direct full-time and part-time jobs across various facilities, while supporting an additional 27,500 indirect jobs in fields such as construction, professional services, logistics, and technology. The cumulative economic impact has contributed more than $29.9 billion to Indiana’s gross domestic product, demonstrating how major technology investments can transform regional economies.

The data center project will also generate substantial tax revenue for local communities, providing resources that can be invested in public services, schools, infrastructure improvements, and community development initiatives. This increased tax base will benefit residents throughout the region, creating opportunities for enhanced public services without placing additional financial burdens on existing taxpayers.

U.S. Representative Rudy Yakym underscored the national significance of the project, stating that it positions Indiana at the forefront of America’s next generation of innovation. As the United States competes globally to lead in artificial intelligence and advanced computing capabilities, investments like Amazon’s ensure that critical technological infrastructure is built domestically, delivering opportunities for American workers and families while strengthening national competitiveness in strategic technologies.

Innovative Energy Partnership Delivers Savings

One of the most innovative aspects of Amazon’s Northern Indiana investment is the groundbreaking energy agreement established with NIPSCO (Northern Indiana Public Service Company), the region’s primary utility provider. This partnership represents a new model for how large-scale data center projects can be structured to benefit existing utility customers rather than imposing additional costs on local residents and businesses.

Under the agreement, Amazon will work with NIPSCO through a newly created subsidiary called NIPSCO Generation LLC (GenCo). Amazon will pay fees to use existing power transmission infrastructure and will cover all costs associated with new power plants, transmission lines, and equipment required to serve the data center project. Critically, these infrastructure investments will be made without passing any additional costs to NIPSCO’s existing residential and commercial customers.

The arrangement is projected to deliver approximately $1 billion in cost savings to current Indiana residents and businesses over a 15-year period. This unprecedented structure demonstrates how major technology companies can partner with utilities to expand capacity while protecting local ratepayers from bearing project risks or experiencing rate increases.

Vince Parisi, NIPSCO’s president and chief operating officer, explained that the agreement represents more than just data center power supply—it’s about powering possibilities for communities through job creation, an expanded tax base, and building a skilled workforce for long-term regional prosperity. The thoughtful structure ensures current customers are protected while the utility expands capacity to meet growing demands from economic development.

The project will add up to 3 gigawatts of new electricity generation capacity, which exceeds Amazon’s requirements of 2.4 gigawatts for the data centers. This additional generation capacity enhances grid reliability for all NIPSCO customers, providing greater assurance that the electrical grid remains stable during periods of peak demand, such as hot summer afternoons when air conditioning usage peaks or frigid winter nights when heating systems operate at maximum capacity.

This energy infrastructure model could serve as a blueprint for future large-scale technology projects across the country, demonstrating that economic development and consumer protection can be balanced effectively through innovative partnership structures. As data centers continue proliferating to meet AI and cloud computing demands, the Indiana approach may influence how utilities and technology companies collaborate in other states and regions.

Comprehensive Workforce Development Initiatives

Recognizing that the success of major infrastructure projects depends on having adequately trained workers, Amazon has committed to extensive workforce development programs that will prepare Indiana residents for careers in the growing data center and broadband industries. These initiatives build upon existing partnerships while introducing new educational programs designed to create pathways into high-skilled technical careers.

The Amazon Community Workforce Accelerator (CWA) program establishes training centers that support careers in cloud computing infrastructure with AWS and its network of contractors, vendors, and partners. These cutting-edge facilities work with community colleges, universities, school districts, industry training organizations, and AWS itself to house various skilled technical trades training programs. The goal is to prepare tomorrow’s workforce to build, connect, power, operate, and maintain AWS data centers throughout the region.

Amazon has partnered with Ivy Tech Community College, Indiana’s largest public postsecondary institution, to integrate Data Center Operations and Fiber Optic Technician Programs into the college’s curriculum. These programs, launched in 2025, bring industry experts and state-of-the-art equipment to local educational institutions, training the next generation of data center operators with the practical skills and knowledge required for these technical roles.

The Fiber Optic Fusion Splicing Workshops represent another targeted training initiative, offering two-day certificate courses at local community colleges, technical schools, and universities. These workshops train individuals in fusion splicing techniques—the process of welding together fiber optical cables—using industry-standard equipment. Upon completing the training, participants are connected with fiber-broadband employers seeking qualified technicians, creating a direct pathway from education to employment.

For educators themselves, Amazon offers Information Infrastructure Workshops, which are one-day sessions designed to help education and workforce leaders better understand the physical infrastructure underlying cloud computing and the modern information economy. These workshops also introduce educators to the diverse career opportunities available in the field, enabling them to better guide students toward these emerging career paths.

The AWS Information Infrastructure Pre-Apprenticeship program, launched at Ivy Tech in April with its first graduating class in May, represents a paid pre-apprenticeship opportunity for students and job-seekers. The program prepares participants for entry into careers building, connecting, powering, and operating the infrastructure of the information economy. Those who successfully complete the program earn industry-recognized credentials and receive guaranteed interviews with AWS or one of its contractors, providing a direct path to employment.

Beyond vocational and technical training, Amazon has committed to supporting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) awareness and learning opportunities throughout K-12 school systems in the region. Programs include “We Build it Better,” which provides middle school and older students with industry-designed curricular experiences in work-like STEM environments equipped with industry-grade tools. For younger students, “We Will Build it Better” brings career awareness programming to elementary classrooms, engaging children in STEAM (STEM plus Arts) environments with age-appropriate tools and technology.

The Think Big Experiences initiative empowers students in technology, programming, and robotics, inspiring young people to consider careers in technology fields from an early age. By engaging students throughout their educational journey, these programs aim to build a robust pipeline of future workers interested in and prepared for careers in cloud computing, AI, and related technological fields.

Amazon also provides support for educational institutions and independent learners through free, ready-to-learn cloud computing curriculum that addresses employer demand for specific skills and roles in cloud support, software development, and data integration. As of 2024, AWS has helped more than 31 million learners across 200 countries and territories build their cloud skills through free training initiatives, democratizing access to education in one of the fastest-growing career fields.

Community Investment and Local Impact

Beyond job creation and workforce development, Amazon has committed to sustained community investment through the Amazon Community Fund, which will launch in communities where the company builds and operates data centers. This grant program will support initiatives focused on key themes including STEM education, sustainability and environmental stewardship, digital skills development, culture and heritage preservation, and health and well-being programs.

Working collaboratively with community partners and local stakeholders, Amazon will identify opportunities to enhance community infrastructure, revitalize public spaces, create new green spaces, promote sustainability initiatives, and invest in priorities identified by local residents. This hyperlocal approach ensures that resources are directed toward projects and programs that matter most to the specific communities where data centers operate, rather than imposing one-size-fits-all initiatives.

The community investment model recognizes that large-scale infrastructure projects create both opportunities and challenges for local communities. By engaging directly with residents, community organizations, and local leaders, Amazon aims to ensure that its presence generates lasting positive impact beyond direct economic benefits. These investments might include parks and recreational facilities, community centers, educational resources for schools, environmental restoration projects, or support for local cultural institutions and events.

Amazon’s broader Indiana operations footprint now includes 15 fulfillment and sortation centers, 11 delivery stations, and data centers in New Carlisle, in addition to the planned Northern Indiana facilities. The company has also made significant investments in renewable energy projects throughout the state, including four solar farms and a wind farm, demonstrating commitment to environmental sustainability alongside economic development.

Strategic Considerations for Data Center Location

Amazon’s selection of Northern Indiana for this major data center expansion reflects careful consideration of multiple factors that make the region attractive for large-scale technology infrastructure. The area provides robust utility infrastructure capable of supporting the massive energy requirements of modern data centers, particularly those optimized for AI workloads that consume substantially more power than traditional computing operations.

The region’s existing workforce and educational institutions provide a foundation for recruiting and training the skilled technical workers required to operate sophisticated data center facilities. Indiana’s central location within the United States offers latency advantages for serving customers throughout the country, while the state’s business climate and regulatory environment facilitate major infrastructure investments.

The availability of land suitable for large campus-style developments, combined with reasonable real estate costs compared to coastal technology hubs, makes the region economically attractive for projects requiring substantial physical footprint. Additionally, Indiana’s relatively lower risk profile for natural disasters compared to regions prone to hurricanes, earthquakes, or wildfires provides operational stability advantages for mission-critical infrastructure.

The partnership with local and state government entities, including tax incentives and supportive regulatory frameworks, further enhances the attractiveness of the location. Governor Braun and other state leaders have emphasized Indiana’s commitment to creating an environment where businesses can invest, grow, and succeed, which has proven instrumental in attracting major technology investments.

The Broader Data Center Expansion Trend

Amazon’s Indiana investment represents just one component of a massive nationwide expansion of data center infrastructure driven by AI and cloud computing demand. Technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Meta, have all announced substantial data center investments across the United States and globally, responding to the computational requirements of modern digital services.

The Data Center Coalition reports that the industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide and contributes billions of dollars annually to local and national economies. As AI capabilities advance and adoption accelerates across industries, demand for data center capacity is projected to continue growing substantially throughout the remainder of the decade and beyond.

This infrastructure expansion has sparked important conversations about energy consumption, environmental impact, and grid capacity. Data centers consume significant amounts of electricity, and AI workloads are particularly power-intensive. The innovative energy agreement Amazon structured with NIPSCO represents one approach to addressing these challenges while ensuring that infrastructure expansion benefits rather than burdens local communities.

Looking Ahead: Indiana’s Technology Future

The combined $26 billion investment by Amazon in Indiana data center infrastructure positions the state as a significant player in the technology sector and particularly in AI development. This transformation from a manufacturing-focused economy to one that includes substantial technology infrastructure represents a strategic evolution that could provide long-term economic benefits.

The workforce development initiatives Amazon has committed to will create educational pathways that extend beyond immediate data center employment, building capabilities that support broader technology sector growth. As workers gain skills in networking, systems administration, fiber optics, electrical systems, and other technical domains, they become qualified for diverse technology careers that may emerge as the sector continues evolving.

The presence of substantial data center infrastructure may also attract other technology companies, startups, and research institutions seeking proximity to advanced computing resources. This clustering effect has been observed in other regions where major technology infrastructure investments catalyzed broader ecosystem development, creating self-reinforcing cycles of investment, talent attraction, and innovation.

David Zapolsky, Amazon’s chief global affairs and legal officer, emphasized that the expansion of advanced cloud infrastructure in Indiana represents investment in the state’s technological future through job creation, skills training initiatives, and community engagement programs. The company’s stated goal is to help power the next wave of technological advancement while delivering tangible benefits that enhance the lives of Indiana residents for years to come.

As the project moves from announcement to construction and eventually to operations, the full scope of impact will become clearer. The successful execution of this initiative could provide a model for how other states can attract major technology infrastructure investments while protecting existing residents and businesses from adverse impacts. The innovative energy partnership, comprehensive workforce development programs, and commitment to community investment represent approaches that could be replicated elsewhere as data center demand continues accelerating.

For Indiana, the Amazon investment represents a vote of confidence in the state’s ability to support cutting-edge technology operations while maintaining the quality of life and economic stability that residents value. As AI continues transforming industries, economies, and daily life, having robust domestic infrastructure to support these technologies becomes increasingly important for national competitiveness and economic prosperity.

The U.S. renewable energy market size was USD 71.92 billion in 2024, is anticipated to be USD 78.36 billion in 2025, and is projected to reach USD 155.56 billion by 2033, registering a CAGR of 8.95% from 2025 to 2033.

The renewable energy with the generation, distribution, and integration of electricity derived from naturally replenishing sources, including wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. Installed renewable capacity now exceeds three hundred and twenty gigawatts, sufficient to power over two hundred and forty million average American homes. Federal policy shifts the Inflation Reduction Act that has unlocked over three hundred and seventy billion dollars in direct incentives, accelerating deployment timelines, and attracting institutional capital.

MARKET DRIVERS

Federal Climate Legislation Unlocking Unprecedented Capital Deployment

They fundamentally altered the investment calculus for renewable energy developers by extending and expanding tax credits across technologies, which is driving the growth of the United States renewable energy market. Developers now benefit from transferability provisions allowing tax credits to be sold to third parties, which is unlocking capital for entities with limited tax appetite. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency allocated over five billion dollars to states for renewable integration under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, targeting disadvantaged communities. These mechanisms collectively reduce project risk, compress payback periods, and attract institutional investors managing over forty trillion dollars in global assets as per the Principles for Responsible Investment.

Corporate Procurement Mandates Accelerating Offtake Commitments

The large corporations are driving renewable energy growth through long-term power purchase agreements motivated by environmental, social, and governance commitments and cost predictability, which is propelling the growth of the United States renewable energy market. According to the Clean Energy Buyers Association, corporate buyers contracted over 37 gigawatts of new renewable capacity in 2023, a forty two% increase from the prior year. Technology and manufacturing firms, including Google, Microsoft, and General Motors, accounted for over 60% of this volume, seeking to meet 100% renewable energy targets by 2030 as verified by RE100. These agreements provide developers with bankable revenue streams, enabling project financing even in the absence of utility offtake.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Transmission Infrastructure Deficits Constraining Interconnection

The existing high voltage transmission network was engineered for centralized fossil fuel generation and lacks the spatial flexibility and capacity required to integrate geographically dispersed renewable resources. The transmission infrastructure deficits are solely restricting the growth of the United States renewable energy market. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, over 1,500 gigawatts of generation capacity, primarily wind and solar, remain stuck in interconnection queues as of early 2024, exceeding the nation’s entire operational generation fleet. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acknowledged that the median interconnection study duration for new projects now exceeds 28 months by causing developers to incur carrying costs of up to one point two million dollars per month.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Repowering Aging Wind and Solar Assets to Unlock Higher Yields and Extend Project Lifespans

The systematic repowering of legacy renewable energy installations presents a substantial opportunity to enhance output without expanding land use or triggering new permitting cycles, which creates new opportunities for the growth of the United States renewable energy market. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over 15 gigawatts of wind capacity installed before 2024 are now eligible for turbine replacement, with newer models offering up to 40% greater annual energy production due to taller hub heights and advanced blade aerodynamics. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory documented that repowering projects in states like Iowa and Texas have achieved capacity factor improvements from 32% to 51%, effectively doubling output per acre. The Internal Revenue Service permits repowered projects to qualify for new investment tax credits if at least 80% of the facility’s value is replaced by creating powerful financial incentives.

Green Hydrogen Integration to Decarbonize Hard-to-Electrify Sectors

The coupling of renewable energy with electrolytic hydrogen production opens a transformative pathway to decarbonize industrial processes, heavy transport, and long-duration energy storage. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Shot initiative, the goal is to reduce clean hydrogen production costs to one dollar per kilogram within a decade, making it competitive with fossil-derived hydrogen, currently priced at 2.5 dollars per kilogram. The Department allocated seven billion dollars in 2023 to establish seven regional clean hydrogen hubs, which are targeting sectors such as steelmaking, ammonia production, and long-haul trucking. Renewable-powered electrolyzers deployed in Texas and California are already producing hydrogen at under three dollars per kilogram, with pilot projects demonstrating round-trip efficiency exceeding sixty percent when paired with fuel cells. The Inflation Reduction Act provides a three-dollar per kilogram production tax credit for hydrogen generated with less than zero point four five kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of H2, effectively subsidizing renewable-based production. This symbiosis not only creates new offtake markets for excess renewable generation but also enables deep decarbonization where direct electrification remains technologically or economically unfeasible.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Skilled Labor Shortages Threatening Project Timelines and Cost Competitiveness

The renewable energy sector’s rapid expansion has outpaced the development of a sufficiently trained and geographically distributed workforce, which may slightly hamper the growth of the United States renewable energy market. According to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, the United States must add skilled workers by 2030 to meet projected installation targets, yet current vocational pipelines graduate fewer than 55,000 annually. Rural deployment zones face the most severe deficits; the Appalachian Regional Commission found that workforce density in renewable trades remains less than twenty percent of national averages despite abundant resource potential.

Regulatory Fragmentation and Siting Conflicts Delaying Critical Infrastructure

The absence of federal preemption over local land use and environmental permitting approval process that varies dramatically across jurisdictions introduces multi-year delays and cost overruns for renewable and transmission projects. These regulatory fragmentation and siting conflicts are delaying infrastructure are limiting the growth of the United States renewable energy market. The median time to secure local permits for utility-scale solar or wind projects exceeds twenty months in over 70% of counties, with some California and Northeastern jurisdictions requiring more than 36 months. Local opposition, often citing visual impact or wildlife concerns, has halted or downsized over twelve gigawatts of proposed projects since 2020, as per the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. The National Environmental Policy Act review process, while essential, lacks standardized timelines, with environmental impact statements averaging four point five years for large projects, according to the White House Council on Environmental Quality.

One local program gives Mecklenburg County residents a shot at a discount solar installation to help beat rising costs.

Two hundred eighty-nine Mecklenburg County residents have signed up for Solarize, the county’s solar energy group purchase program.

“The more people that purchase solar at one time, the easier it is for the solar company to make the cost of it go down,” said Heather Bolick, Charlotte’s chief sustainability and resiliency officer.

Registration for Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg ends this Friday. Homeowner Hope Lifsey in East Charlotte participated in the program early on. Her 13 solar panels face southeast from her ranch-style home, charging her new Tesla battery.

“I've only had one bill since the solar's been installed, but that bill was like $43, so definitely good,” Lifsey said.

She said she’ll be able to recover the cost of her solar and battery system in eight years.

The five-kilowatt array can charge the battery in about three hours. The battery can, in turn, keep the lights on when the power goes out. Her neighborhood experienced several outages over the summer.

“It's just ridiculous,” Lifsey said. “One day it was out for seven hours, and it was like 98 degrees outside.”

Lifsey’s exasperation gets at a serious problem in Charlotte. The city recently conducted a climate risk assessment, finding that extreme heat — along with severe thunderstorms — poses the biggest climate-related threat to residents. Solar panels on their own wouldn’t solve Lifsey’s problem — they automatically shut off during outages to avoid electrocuting lineworkers. However, the battery system allows her to create a kind of energy island, circulating solar power through her home and battery without backfeeding to the grid.

How long that charge lasts depends on Lifsey. More specifically, it depends on the appliances she uses. She has an app on her phone that allows her to monitor her power production and usage in real time. She’s learned that certain appliances, such as her electric range or dryer, draw a lot of power.

“So, when the power does go out, I know maybe I don’t want to make some tater tots tonight, because I'm living off the battery,” Lifsey said. She glanced down at her phone, “I’m off the grid right now.”

The app showed that her panels were generating 3.3 kilowatts of power. Since her home was only using 0.4 kilowatts, the extra energy flowed into her battery.

“Whatever solar my house and the battery don't need is sold to Duke [Energy],” Lifsey said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad34db7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5591x2935+0+105/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F44%2F0a57389247e99c581187d4c37029%2Fdsc-0767.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 01:59:21.817462

Indiana’s Model of Cooperative Innovation What is happening in Indiana offers a powerful counterexample to the dangers of government overreach.
The lesson of Bayh-Dole—and of a system that encourages research and exploration—is that innovation does not happen in a vacuum.","Earlier this month, Andrew Langer, Executive Director of the Coalition Against Socialized Medicine (CASM), visited the Novartis Radioligand Therapy (RLT) manufacturing facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. The visit was part of the Biotechnology Industry Organization’s (BIO) “BIO on the American Road” (BOTAR) series—a national tour highlighting the innovations transforming American medicine and biotechnology.

Standing on the production floor of the facility, surrounded by engineers, chemists, and technicians who are redefining the future of cancer treatment, Langer was reminded of a fundamental truth: American innovation continues to save lives each and every day—but it doesn’t happen by accident. It depends on deliberate public policy choices that encourage invention, protect intellectual property, and reward risk-taking.

Among the most important of these choices was the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, a bipartisan reform that set off a revolution in how publicly funded research is translated into real-world treatments. CASM and its member organizations have long championed Bayh-Dole as the single most successful innovation policy in American history—one that continues to serve as the foundation for breakthroughs like those taking place in Indiana today.

Indiana: The World’s Capital of Radiopharmaceutical Manufacturing

Indiana’s rise to become the radiopharmaceutical manufacturing capital of the world was no accident. It was the product of foresight, partnership, and a willingness to align policy with opportunity.

The state deliberately positioned itself to lead in this emerging field, cultivating relationships between academia, private industry, and state government. Purdue University has even launched a graduate degree in radiopharmaceutical manufacturing, an industry-first program developed through collaboration with Novartis and other biotechnology leaders.

At the Novartis RLT facility, Langer saw the results of this synergy firsthand. The facility produces precision-targeted therapies that pair radioactive isotopes with molecules designed to locate and destroy cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. This is not a theoretical concept—it’s a medical revolution already saving lives.

These therapies exemplify the promise of theranostics, an approach that merges diagnostics and therapeutics to identify, target, and treat disease with unmatched precision. The combination of scientific excellence, private investment, and pro-innovation public policy has made Indiana a global model for biomedical advancement.

Bayh-Dole: The Policy Engine of American Discovery

None of this innovation would exist without the framework provided by the Bayh-Dole Act, co-authored by Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana and Bob Dole of Kansas. Before Bayh-Dole’s passage, the federal government owned the rights to thousands of patents generated through taxpayer-funded research. Most of these discoveries never left the laboratory—buried under bureaucratic inertia.

Bayh-Dole changed that. It allowed universities, small businesses, and nonprofits to retain ownership of inventions developed with federal funding and to license them to private partners for development and commercialization. The result was nothing short of transformative. The United States became the global epicenter of biotechnology, with a thriving ecosystem that produced hundreds of breakthrough therapies and trillions of dollars in economic growth.

Observers of biomedical research often describe Bayh-Dole as the “warp drive” of American innovation—an elegant policy solution that released the creative energy of scientists, entrepreneurs, and investors. By aligning incentives across the public and private sectors, the law ensured that discoveries made in university laboratories could be translated into products that save lives.

But as CASM has warned, this success is now under threat. America’s growing socialist movement (and their willing dupes among progressives) have sought to twist the Bayh-Dole Act’s “march-in rights”—originally designed to ensure public access to unused inventions—into a mechanism for government price control. Such reinterpretations would represent a radical departure from the law’s original intent, create a direct assault on the very system that produced America’s biomedical dominance, and serve to create a slowdown or even “full stop” to that “innovation warp drive”.

Innovation Requires Certainty, Not Bureaucratic Intervention

In his conversations with researchers at Novartis, Langer heard a consistent refrain: innovation requires certainty. The development of advanced therapies depends on the confidence that intellectual property will be protected and that the rules of the game will remain stable—and that government bureaucrats will not needlessly throw roadblocks in the way of not just research and development, but the actual delivery of lifesaving technologies to those who need them.

It should be noted that with RLT therapies, time is of the essence. Each dose is manufactured for a specific patient, with a shelf-life of mere hours. Every hour lost between manufacture and utilization runs the risk of having the effectiveness of that treatment blunted, and so many hours are lost due to extraneous paperwork and bureaucratic hoops. This needs to change.

The burden of red tape is a threat to everyone: the patients who potentially lose out on lifesaving therapies, and the large companies working to provide them with the groundbreaking medicines. For start-ups and smaller biotech companies—those without the deep pockets of multinational firms—this uncertainty can be fatal. The threat of government second-guessing or price interference discourages investors, delays development, and diminishes the likelihood that life-saving therapies will ever reach patients.

CASM and its allies have repeatedly emphasized that the Bayh-Dole Act was designed to promote utilization, not regulation. Its purpose was to make sure inventions are used and commercialized—not to give the government the power to decide how much a life-saving drug should cost or whether a company deserves to profit from its creation.

The Cautionary Tale of Trofim Lysenko

The tension between science and politics is not new, and history offers a stark warning about what happens when ideology overrides evidence and a bureaucracy is co-opted. In the Soviet Union, a mid-20th-century agronomist named Trofim Lysenko rose to prominence by promoting pseudo-scientific ideas that aligned with Marxist doctrine. Lysenko rejected the principles of genetics and insisted that environmental manipulation alone could alter heredity—a claim that fit the political narrative of his time.

Under Stalin’s patronage, Lysenko’s theories became state policy. Geneticists who opposed him were silenced or executed. Agricultural production plummeted.

Millions starved.

Lysenko’s story is a warning against allowing politics to dictate scientific progress—and utilizing bureaucratic power to hamstring innovation. While today’s policymakers are not sending scientists to gulags, the impulse to bend science to fit ideology persists—in proposals that not only demonize those doing innovative research but also those engaging in the practice of medicine. We already have a crisis in the gap between the number of physicians we have and the number we need—pushing policies that dismiss the vital contribution that medical practitioners make in keeping Americans healthy will only exacerbate that problem further.

When government substitutes ideology for evidence, innovation dies. The lesson of Lysenkoism is that science cannot thrive under political coercion. The American innovation model has always depended on freedom—freedom to inquire, to test, to fail, and to profit from success. Laws like Bayh-Dole protect that freedom, ensuring that discovery is guided by curiosity and competition, not by central planning.

Indiana’s Model of Cooperative Innovation

What is happening in Indiana offers a powerful counterexample to the dangers of government overreach. The state’s bioscience community—anchored by Purdue University and strengthened by global companies like Novartis—demonstrates how public-private collaboration can accelerate innovation when guided by sound principles.

Purdue’s new radiopharmaceutical manufacturing program exemplifies this approach. It equips students with hands-on expertise in areas like isotope production, supply-chain logistics, and regulatory compliance—skills vital to sustaining America’s leadership in nuclear medicine. Graduates of this program will not only fill high-paying jobs but will also drive forward the next generation of medical breakthroughs.

Indiana’s success is economic as well as moral. The state’s biomanufacturing sector supports thousands of workers and attracts billions in investment each year. More importantly, it delivers real hope to patients. The therapies being produced there are not abstract research projects; they are tangible, effective treatments for diseases once thought incurable.

The Threat of Centralized Control Masquerading as Reform

Yet even as states like Indiana are proving what a free innovation economy can achieve, Washington is drifting toward a very different model. Recent actions by federal agencies—including CMS’s price-setting regime under the Inflation Reduction Act, NIH’s intrusive access-plan policy, and NIST’s proposed march-in reinterpretations—represent a creeping return to centralized control.

Under these frameworks, bureaucrats, not scientists or entrepreneurs, increasingly decide which drugs are developed, how they are priced, and who can bring them to market. It is a slow but steady march toward the kind of government-controlled system that CASM was founded to oppose.

CASM argues that this is not simply a matter of economics—it’s a moral question. A society that punishes success and politicizes discovery will produce fewer cures, fewer breakthroughs, and fewer miracles. The radiopharmaceutical industry offers the clearest possible evidence that freedom, not force, fuels progress.

Preserving America’s Innovation: “Warp Drive”

The Novartis facility represents the physical embodiment of a policy success story decades in the making. From a few lines of legislation passed in 1980 has sprung an entire universe of invention—one that continues to expand the boundaries of human health and possibility.

But we must recognize how fragile that ecosystem is. The balance that Bayh-Dole struck—between public investment and private ownership, between academic discovery and commercial development—must be protected. If the federal government starts signaling that innovation will not be protected, the results will be disastrous. The capital that funds research will vanish, and the next generation of therapies will remain trapped in laboratories instead of reaching patients who need them.

Indiana’s biopharmaceutical renaissance tells a larger story about the United States itself. When policymakers trust innovators and protect property rights, progress flourishes. When they replace competition with control, progress withers.

The lesson of Bayh-Dole—and of a system that encourages research and exploration—is that innovation does not happen in a vacuum. It happens when free minds are free to explore, when entrepreneurs can reap the rewards of risk, and when the law safeguards discovery from political interference.

From the failure of Lysenkoism to the triumph of radiopharmaceutical science, the verdict of history is clear: Science serves humanity best when it is free. The challenge before policymakers today is to keep it that way—by rejecting socialized models of control and preserving the American tradition of innovation that turns ideas into cures and imagination into life.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b5d67b_e5d60f65fc574567862fe89889649954~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/b5d67b_e5d60f65fc574567862fe89889649954~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-25 01:59:30.426474

For example, heat can reduce the load that the system can carry, while wind cools power lines that can provide existing lines with the ability to carry additional capacity.
Special coatings — which may be applied autonomously — can cool power lines and potentially enhance longevity.
Our Pulse Report shows that nearly four out of five Americans (77 percent) would like to know more about how to improve the electric grid in their community.
In short: We must treat the U.S. grid as the critical asset that it is.","America’s electric grid is at a tipping point. Decades of under-investment, aging infrastructure, increasing demand from electrification and growing weather-related risks are converging.

To keep our lights on while growing the economy, we must optimize existing assets; build infrastructure to generate additional power and link supply and demand; and engage key stakeholders.

Here’s how.

1) Optimize: From congestion to capacity

A shift in mindset and new approaches can help us get more from existing assets. In fact, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is requiring transmission providers to consider alternative technologies that can offer faster, cost-effective ways to expand grid capacity and improve performance.

Some of the most common grid enhancing technologies include tower lifting, which helps fix sagging power lines; and dynamic line ratings, which use sensors to track how weather affects line capacity. For example, heat can reduce the load that the system can carry, while wind cools power lines that can provide existing lines with the ability to carry additional capacity. Special coatings — which may be applied autonomously — can cool power lines and potentially enhance longevity.

Advanced analytics, sensors and digital twins can also help predict needs in advance, allowing operators to focus limited resources where they can have the greatest impact. By modeling grid behavior under various scenarios — from extreme weather to demand spikes — utilities can better prepare for disruptions. For example, a utility might use sensors on transmission lines or transformer health metrics to predict when failure is more likely, allowing preemptive action while increasing the likely return on investment.

These approaches can help flatten peak loads, reduce transmission congestion and make the most of distributed energy resources, like solar. While maintenance and optimization are the most economical options, over the long run, optimization alone won’t be enough. We also need to generate additional power and connect it to places with rising demand. We need to build.

2) Build: From micro-grids to big bets

Achieving U.S. energy security, let alone energy dominance, requires an all-of-the-above strategy with a diverse mix of energy sources, including fossil fuels, renewables, nuclear and emerging technologies. We need new sources of power generation, the flexibility that micro-grids can offer, and behind-the-meter developments, especially those co-located with heavy energy users.

We also need to expand battery storage, particularly alongside renewable energy, an approach that has broad support. WSP’s 2025 Pulse Report: Energy found that nearly seven out of 10 (69 percent) Americans believe the U.S. government should invest more in battery storage to make the electric grid more resilient. Breakthroughs in next-generation battery storage will make renewable energy more reliable, scalable and sustainable — creating a more resilient grid.

Energy generation and storage are one part of the equation, but transmission may be even more critical. An industry coalition estimates the U.S. should build approximately 5,000 miles of new high-capacity transmission lines annually through 2040 to meet growing demand. With only 322 miles of high-voltage lines completed in 2024, we’re not yet close to the pace required. We need to improve resilience and plan for future growth with new high-capacity transmission, new converter stations, buried cables and upgraded lines.

The good news is that 92 percent of people surveyed are open to new transmission through their community if the projects help the U.S. meet the growing demand for power — even if it may not benefit them directly. Additionally, a number of promising projects are underway that will benefit millions. One example is the Champlain Hudson Power Express, a new high-voltage transmission line bringing hydropower-generated electricity from Canada to New York City. At approximately 339 miles, it’s the largest underground project of its kind ever attempted in North America. Once completed, the project will deliver 1,250 megawatts of clean hydroelectricity, enough to power over one million homes.

The industry is also exploring new options. For example, the U.S. continues to develop the use of 765 kilovolt technology, ultra-high voltage alternating current systems that transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances with high efficiency, reducing transmission losses and the number of transmission lines needed. The use of AI could also allow us to be more confident in quicker decision-making around route optimization, environmental impact assessments and other challenges.

Progress will require us to use all of the tools available and engage stakeholders in the process.

3) Engage: Understanding people and perspectives

Even the best strategies can falter without broad stakeholder buy-in. Public involvement is particularly critical for energy infrastructure projects, to both solicit ideas and support the funding and decision-making needed to build and maintain a smarter, stronger grid. Multiple stakeholders need to understand siting, environmental impacts, workforce training and cost. Involving communities early helps build trust, reduce conflict and improve outcomes. The good news is that most people want to learn more.

Our Pulse Report shows that nearly four out of five Americans (77 percent) would like to know more about how to improve the electric grid in their community. A notable 28 percent are what we call “energy enthusiasts” — people who strongly agree that they want to know more about how to improve the electric grid in their community.

Those relatively strong numbers reflect the fact that Americans are worried about the aging grid, with 78 percent expressing concern about dependable electricity without power outages. In fact, when considering potential tradeoffs between additional investment in reliability and lower costs, reliability seems to be the greater concern. Today, 65 percent of Americans would be willing to pay slightly more for electricity if it meant building a more reliable electric grid, compared to 61 percent who said the same in late 2023.

That shows people are ready for change. Utilities, regulators, municipalities and private developers must all communicate honestly about trade-offs: what upgrades will cost, what the risks are if we don’t act, how long construction takes, and what the benefits will be in terms of reliability, emissions and costs.

People want leaders to move more quickly to address these challenges, as 71 percent of Americans agree the federal government should speed up permitting for essential electric grid projects even if that reduces local government control.

In short: We must treat the U.S. grid as the critical asset that it is. The choices we make today will define our energy infrastructure for decades to come.

By optimizing existing assets, building new generation and modern transmission assets, and engaging stakeholders, we can deliver a grid that is reliable, clean, affordable and truly future ready.",https://www.wsp.com/-/media/insights/us/electric-grid-joe-sczurko/lin-joe-sczurko-smarter-electric-grid.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 23:58:45.472887

“We’re seeing a breakdown between the demand and supply sides of the market, with the biggest actors playing on both sides,” WoodMac’s Ben Hertz-Shargel told Bloomberg.

“To better orchestrate growth, you need some of the largest buyers of electricity to actively support the buildout of the supply side.”

If Meta and other tech giants commit to long-term purchase agreements, power capacity developers will be more willing to invest in long-lead plant construction.

Meta alone is investing $600 billion in the U.S. by 2028 to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion, the company said earlier this month.

The company says it’s making additional investments in energy supply and these have so far helped to add more than 15 GW of new energy projects to the grid across 27 states, representing more than $16 billion in capital investments.

It’s not only clean energy that will power the huge data centers of the hyperscalers—natural gas will play an important role, too.

For example, Meta’s new data center in Richland Parish in Louisiana, worth over $10 billion, will source electricity from three new gas-fired power plants after the Louisiana Public Service Commission this summer approved an agreement that paves the way for Entergy Louisiana to build these plants.

“Importantly, Meta is paying its share of the costs for the infrastructure needed to support its operations, ensuring that other customers are protected from those expenses,” Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO, said in August.

When oil markets swing from one extreme to another, the steadier side of the energy sector often gets overlooked.

Roughly three-quarters of North American midstream assets now center on natural gas rather than oil.

In a landscape known for booms and busts, gas-focused midstream MLPs offer a steadier path—one that may quietly outperform more volatile corners of the energy market.

The plan includes sales off Alaska, in the Gulf, and off the Pacific coast, though none in the Atlantic.
“Offshore oil and gas development requires long-term vision, steady policy and the confidence for companies to invest in American energy.
The move is expected to reignite political conflict, particularly with California, where leaders have vowed to block new offshore drilling.
The Interior Department will open a 60-day public comment period before finalizing the program.","The Interior Department on Thursday outlined an aggressive offshore leasing plan that would open as many as 34 oil and gas lease sales between 2026 and 2031, including seven in the Gulf.

The proposal—part of President Trump’s broader push to restore “energy dominance”—would replace the Biden-era five-year program and expand leasing across 21 of 27 Outer Continental Shelf planning areas.

The plan includes sales off Alaska, in the Gulf, and off the Pacific coast, though none in the Atlantic. Interior officials say the policy is intended to boost domestic production, stabilize long-term supply and strengthen U.S. energy independence.

The proposal also includes Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s decision to create a new administrative planning area, the South-Central Gulf.

“Offshore oil and gas development requires long-term vision, steady policy and the confidence for companies to invest in American energy. For years, that confidence was undercut by the Biden administration’s failed leasing policies,” said Jarrod Agen, executive director of the National Energy Dominance Council, in a prepared statement. “By putting a real leasing plan back on track, we’re restoring energy security, protecting American jobs, and strengthening the nation’s ability to lead on energy for decades to come.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimates current offshore operations account for about 15% of U.S. crude output.

Haymon says Loadstar sought the certification in part to publicly affirm its long-term priorities.
The institute provides ongoing support and networking opportunities for Evergreen companies and their leaders, and Haymon says Loadstar intends to remain active in that ecosystem.
It’s hard to predict how rapidly the Evergreen movement will grow, but people seem to respond very favorably when we tell the Loadstar Evergreen story.","Baton Rouge-based Loadstar has become the first company in Louisiana to earn Certified Evergreen status.

The designation, awarded by the Idaho-based Tugboat Institute, recognizes firms that pledge to remain private for at least a century and remain committed to “purpose-driven, people-first growth.”

Founded in 2021, Loadstar provides product handling and site logistics services to the refining, chemical and marine industries. The company has seen steady growth since its inception, expanding both its geographic footprint and its service offerings. It landed on Business Report’s Best Places to Work lists in both 2023 and 2024, and was a finalist for Company of the Year in the recent Louisiana Energy Awards, presented by Business Report’s 10/12 Industry Report.

Founder and CEO Brian Haymon describes the Evergreen certification as the “highest standard of recognition for companies committed to the Evergreen style of management.”

That management style is guided by the “7Ps,” or the seven defining characteristics of all Evergreen companies: purpose, perseverance, people first, private, profit, paced growth and pragmatic innovation.

Haymon says Loadstar sought the certification in part to publicly affirm its long-term priorities.

“We wanted to state clearly and publicly who we are, and what we stand for,” Haymon says. “A pledge to remain privately held for at least 100 years is a bold commitment, but one we were comfortable making. Evergreen and the 7Ps align perfectly with our philosophy and give us a foundation upon which to grow sustainably, invest with purpose and try to make a difference in the world.”

Haymon says the certification process was “very thorough and detailed” and took nearly a year to complete. That process included evaluations of Loadstar’s financial health, governance, growth strategy, risk tolerance and succession plan, among other areas, as well as an extensive employee survey. It also called for a financial commitment.

“The cost was not insignificant,” Haymon says, “but we felt it was well worth the investment.”

Loadstar is now one of only about 50 companies across the country to have earned Certified Evergreen status.

And while the certification itself marks the capstone of a rigorous months-long effort, Loadstar’s engagement with the Tugboat Institute doesn’t end with the designation. The institute provides ongoing support and networking opportunities for Evergreen companies and their leaders, and Haymon says Loadstar intends to remain active in that ecosystem.

“We plan to stay engaged and continue to learn from other Evergreen leaders who work in every sector of the economy,” he says.

Asked whether more Louisiana companies might follow in Loadstar’s footsteps, Haymon answers with cautious optimism.

“Business leaders are increasingly searching for alternatives to the short-term, exit-driven models that have become very popular over the past two decades,” he says. “Long before the term ‘Evergreen’ was invented, America was built by companies that put people first, invested prudently, planned for the long term and lasted for generations. We see Evergreen as a return to those fundamentals. It’s hard to predict how rapidly the Evergreen movement will grow, but people seem to respond very favorably when we tell the Loadstar Evergreen story. Perhaps our story will inspire others.”",https://www.1012industryreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Barge.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-24 21:02:00.433557

That said, a second Trump presidency is expected to significantly set back global climate goals, primarily by weakening U.S. domestic climate policy and disengaging from international climate efforts.","The latest edition of the annual UN climate summit ended with little fanfare on Friday, marking a decade since the famous Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Dubbed COP30, the summit held in Brazil followed the usual pattern of the experts warning of how far off track the world is from meeting its climate goals, but failed to discuss a shift away from fossil fuels for the second year running. However, here's a little 'trivia' the experts rarely talk about: the world has by far exceeded the most ambitious climate forecasts from just a decade ago, with renewable energy and electric vehicle adoption growing much faster than expected.

To wit, 553 gigawatts of solar power--enough to power 100 million U.S. homes--was installed across the globe last year, 15 times more than the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected in 2015. The world's total installed solar capacity is now four times what the IEA projected 10 years ago. Meanwhile, more than 20% of new vehicles sold worldwide today are EVs, a dramatic increase from less than 1% in 2015. The world is now on track to hit 100 million EVs in 2028, even if growth flatlines from here.

But here's the kicker: the planet is on course to record a 2.6 degrees increase in global temperatures by 2100, avoiding the catastrophic 4 degrees projected just a decade ago.

So, why did the navel gazers get it so wrong this time around? A big part of it is that modelers grossly underestimated the scale of clean energy manufacturing in China which has helped drive down renewable energy costs. China's immense scale of clean energy manufacturing has fundamentally driven down global costs of renewable technologies through economies of scale and innovation, making clean energy the most affordable option in most markets worldwide.

As of 2024, China accounted for over 80% of global solar panel production across all key stages and produced around 60% of the world's wind turbines and battery cell manufacturing. China's current manufacturing capacity for solar panels and batteries is greater than the global demand, leading to a supply glut and intense price competition that further reduces costs globally.

Since 2010, the costs of solar PV, wind, and batteries have fallen by between 60% and 90%, a trend largely attributed to China's rapid increase in production volume. Not surprisingly, more than 90% of newly commissioned wind and solar facilities globally in 2024 were cheaper than the cheapest available form of fossil fuel generation.

While China's clean energy manufacturing boom has been blamed for distorting the global markets, it's proving to be good for the environment. The affordability of these technologies enables faster adoption, particularly in emerging markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, many of which are now leapfrogging traditional fossil fuel infrastructure. Clean energy goods exported from China in 2024 alone are estimated to cut importing countries' carbon emissions by 1% annually, with the cumulative lifetime emissions savings from these products reaching an estimated 4.0 GtCO2. Indeed, the IEA has forecast that global emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year in 2040, significantly lower than the 46 metric gigatons it had projected in 2015. And, that's if countries continue doing business as usual: the IEA says the figure could drop to just 33 metric gigatons per year if countries follow through on their pledges.

That said, a second Trump presidency is expected to significantly set back global climate goals, primarily by weakening U.S. domestic climate policy and disengaging from international climate efforts. President Trump has already re-submitted the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which will formally take effect in 2026. This action removes the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, from the primary global climate cooperation framework and could reduce global trust in U.S. commitments, potentially encouraging other climate-laggard nations to stymie their own efforts.

The administration has targeted key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), halting billions in clean energy tax credits and loans for wind and solar projects, and has also revoked an order setting a 50% electric vehicle target for 2030. Meanwhile, the U.S. is expected to cease or significantly reduce its contributions to international climate funds, such as the Climate Loss and Damage Fund, resulting in less financing available for developing economies to address climate change and adopt cleaner energy measures.

Overall, analysts predict that Trump's policies, which focus on maximizing oil and gas production and rolling back environmental regulations, could result in the U.S. emitting an additional 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2030 compared to previous projections.

The Municipal Investment Fund Market Building Grant — courtesy of the Coalition for Green Capital — looks to build a pipeline of clean energy projects, creating jobs, cutting electricity prices and helping Missoula meet its climate goals and take control of its energy future.

Missoula, which announced the grant on Friday, is one of 50 cities to receive the funding.

“The Municipal Investment Fund grant is an important step forward in our work to make Missoula stronger, more sustainable and more affordable for everyone,” Mayor Andrea Davis said in a statement. “This is a great win.”

The grant also included Clearwater Credit Union, making it a public-private investment in clean energy. The funding will help the city and bank develop a “suite of clean energy projects that will reduce pollution and bring down energy costs” for homes and businesses.

""There is a global energy revolution happening right now, and we’re excited to help bring the benefits to Montana,” said Paul Herendeen, vice president of sustainability at Clearwater Credit Union. “Investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency can save Montanans money, make our homes healthier and more comfortable, and support local jobs.”

Missoula has taken steps over the last decade to address climate concerns by reducing its carbon footprint. It completed a greenhouse gas inventory, made energy-efficient upgrades at its wastewater facility, and issued a climate action plan.

More recently, it also partnered with Bozeman and NorthWestern Energy to develop and implement the state's first green tariff in pursuit of achieving 100% clean electricity. That effort is now years in the making.

Local officials see such goals an opportunity to attract investment.

MVP is seeking authorization to construct and operate the “Amendment Project,” a modified version of the MVP Southgate project originally proposed in 2018.

The protest filing highlights new expert analysis demonstrating the lack of market need for the pipeline and urges FERC not to authorize MVP’s costly and damaging project. MVP Southgate would extend the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline into North Carolina to deliver more climate-damaging methane gas to Duke Energy and Public Service Company of North Carolina. The Southgate project is part of the unprecedented expansion of gas infrastructure underway across the South, where in just the last several years, industry has proposed enough new pipeline capacity to fuel dozens of new power plants.

A new expert report by London Economics International was also filed with FERC today, concluding that the proposed pipeline is not needed to meet current or future gas demand. The report findings include:

Both of the pipeline’s proposed shippers, Duke Energy and Public Service Company of North Carolina, can meet projected demand for gas using their existing and other proposed resources—without MVP Southgate.

Duke Energy will have enough pipeline capacity to meet its electricity generation needs through at least 2040.

Public Service Company of North Carolina can meet demand for gas on even the coldest winter days through the use of on-system storage and other resources.

“This report confirms what we have long suspected: MVP Southgate can’t be justified by need,” said SELC senior attorney Mark Sabath. “The environmental and community costs of building an unnecessary pipeline are too dire for FERC to approve this project.”

He continues to serve as president of one oilfield waste company and holds stock in several others, according to financial disclosure statements.
The Railroad Commission oversees oilfield waste landfills and recycling facilities, which often raise health and safety concerns among nearby residents.
Following a hearing, the Railroad Commission staff recommended approving the application.
When the Railroad Commission published its final order approving the permit, Commissioners Craddick and Christian signed their names.","Jim Wright stepped out of the room last week while his fellow Railroad Commissioners voted to renew the permit for Eagleford Recycling LLC, an oilfield waste company to which he has financial ties.

It was an unusually public recognition of his ongoing financial stakes in companies that are regulated by the Railroad Commission.

The agency, which regulates oil and gas extraction and disposal, is led by three elected commissioners. Wright, a Republican elected in 2020, touts his experience in the oilfield waste industry as an asset to his work as a commissioner. He continues to serve as president of one oilfield waste company and holds stock in several others, according to financial disclosure statements. Advocates have called for stricter conflict of interest protocols at the Railroad Commission and urged commissioners to recuse themselves from matters in which they have a financial interest.

“We’re glad to see that Chairman Wright followed state law today and recused himself from a decision which he has a private interest in,” said Virginia Palacios, executive director of the nonprofit Commission Shift. “Although this represents the bare minimum of what we should expect from public officials, it is a step forward for the Railroad Commission.”

Commission Shift called the recusal “historic.” The organization documented Wright’s extensive holdings in the oil and gas industry in a 2021 report titled “Captive Agency.” Commissioners also frequently accept campaign contributions from companies with business before the agency. Wright’s recusal, a Commission Shift spokesperson said, was the first by a member of the Railroad Commission for having a financial tie to a regulated company at least since 2020.

Wright previously recused himself from a vote in 2021 because his general counsel had worked on the matter in private practice.

The move comes as Wright mounts a campaign for a second six-year term on the commission. Well control expert Hawk Dunlap and far-right activist Bo French are contending for the Republican nomination. Mechanical engineer and state Rep. Jon Rosenthal of Houston is running for the Democratic nomination.

“Chairman Wright is focused on running his race. He will continue to work on behalf of all Texans to ensure energy production remains a cornerstone of our state’s economy,” said Aaron Krejci, his spokesperson. “That will not change no matter who else is on the ballot.”

“I’m Going to Step Out”

During the agency’s monthly open meeting in Austin on Nov. 18, the second agenda item was Eagleford Recycling LLC’s application for a permit renewal and amendment. Before the commissioners voted on the permit, Wright stood up.

“I’m going to step out because I have a financial interest in this,” he said. “So in case you all have a discussion, you can.”

Commissioners Christi Craddick and Wayne Christian both voted to approve the permit. It passed 2-0 in Wright’s absence.

Krejci, Wright’s spokesperson, said he owns “a small financial interest (approximately 5%)” in the company and is not involved in day-to-day operations. Krejci said that Wright would recuse himself from future votes in which he has financial interests.

“That has always been his position,” Krejci said.

Wright also has stock in Environmental Evolutions National, EEES Energy Solutions, Environmental Evolutions Holdings, Environmental Evolutions Transportation, Environmental Tank Solutions and Greenergy Companies, according to his 2024 disclosure statements. Neighboring Oklahoma does not allow their oil and gas regulators to own interests in the industry they regulate.

Wright founded DeWitt Recyclable Products, LLC in 2011, as the shale boom was taking off in South Texas. The company’s facility in DeWitt County disposed of and reclaimed oil and gas waste. The Railroad Commission oversees oilfield waste landfills and recycling facilities, which often raise health and safety concerns among nearby residents.

After Wright sold the company in 2014, it was renamed Eagleford Recycling LLC. Contamination at the site later led the Railroad Commission to cancel its permit in 2017. Wright maintained the pollution occurred after he sold the company.

Eagleford Recycling LLC obtained a new permit in 2020 that ran through 2025. The company applied for a permit renewal and amendment earlier this year. The existing permit already allows the company to produce roadbase, a paving material, from oilfield drilling waste. The permit amendment would allow the company to market this as a “reusable product.”

The company’s prior permit allowed the roadbase to be used on “lease roads, well pads or on private roads and county roads with authorization from the respective property owners and county commissioners.” Commission Shift has raised concerns about the use of drill cuttings for roadbase because of the volatile organic compounds in the waste.

Two residents who live near the facility outside Cuero challenged the permit. They argued that groundwater contamination could occur at the site and objected to Wright’s personal financial interest in Eagleford. Following a hearing, the Railroad Commission staff recommended approving the application.

When the Railroad Commission published its final order approving the permit, Commissioners Craddick and Christian signed their names. By Commissioner Wright’s name, the word “recused” was printed.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jim-Wright.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 21:01:55.254070

Around 6.8 GW of new large load projects entered the pipeline, and projects in the pipeline increased their projected load by a total of 1.6 GW, while 14.3 GW of projects exited, Georgia Power said.
Georgia Power’s pipeline of near-term large load projects slated for winter of 2028 and 2029 decreased this quarter by 1.4 GW, to a total of 24.4 GW, the report said.
“Although the total and large load economic development pipelines have shrunk, the number of commitments to Georgia Power for electric service from large load customers have grown from 26 to 28,” Georgia Power said in the report.

Georgia Power’s pipeline of large load economic development projects shrank a net 6 GW from the second quarter to the third quarter to 50.9 GW due to projects that exited, the utility said in a Friday filing with the Georgia Public Service Commission.

Around 6.8 GW of new large load projects entered the pipeline, and projects in the pipeline increased their projected load by a total of 1.6 GW, while 14.3 GW of projects exited, Georgia Power said.

Georgia Power’s pipeline of near-term large load projects slated for winter of 2028 and 2029 decreased this quarter by 1.4 GW, to a total of 24.4 GW, the report said.

“Although the total and large load economic development pipelines have shrunk, the number of commitments to Georgia Power for electric service from large load customers have grown from 26 to 28,” Georgia Power said in the report.

Those two new commitments together account for 2.2 GW and bring the utility’s total commitments to 11 GW, the report said, and since last quarter “an additional five customers have broken ground, reflecting an increase in the long-term load from 3,721 MW in Q2 2025 to 7,313 MW in Q3 2025.”

Of the 28 committed projects, 18 have broken ground and 10 are pending construction, which “indicates that these large load customers are materializing and making progress without material delays,” the report said.

Georgia Power said that in the near-term, “projects that have broken ground represent 6,175 MW of the total 7,800 MW of customer commitments for the winter of 2028/2029.” The utility could not be immediately reached for comment.

Testimony filed Nov. 12 on behalf of the commission’s public interest advocacy staff warned that Georgia Power’s residential customers could see their monthly bills increase if the utility completes its planned generation buildout to support new data centers.

“The majority of the new generation Georgia Power seeks to certify … is not backed by executed contracts under the new large load framework,” stated the testimony, given by PSC staff members and consulting analysts. “Only about 1,900 MW is supported by such contracts. The rest is speculative and exposes customers to the risk of stranded costs if the anticipated load does not materialize.”

The staff testimony noted that the data center segment is “primarily underperforming expectations due to a mixture of lower materialization rates, project cancellations, and delays.”

Can we please stop assuming somebody is going to organize all this to go net negative and then it magically happens?
Also, which sectors would be forced to go net negative, which ones can stay net positive?
The country’s National Nuclear Energy Commission approved construction of Latin America’s first nuclear waste repository, set to start next year, World Nuclear News reported.
Under the new structure, geothermal and fossil fuels will live together under the new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.","The idea demands a far meatier discussion than world leaders have had to date, according to Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, and a key contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scientific reports. If limiting warming to 1.5 degrees now requires surpassing that level and coming back to it later, and if this is something that countries actually want to attempt, there are a lot of implications to think through.

Geden and Andy Reisinger, an associate professor at Australian National University and another IPCC author, published an article last week spelling out what it would mean for policymakers to take this concept of “temporary overshoot” seriously. For example, the final agreement from COP30 encourages Parties to align their nationally determined contributions towards global net zero by or around mid-century.” Net zero, in this case, means cutting CO2 emissions as far as possible, and then cancelling out any residuals with efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Scientists now estimate that if the world achieves that balance by 2050, we’ll pass 1.5 and bring warming to a peak of about 1.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels. At that point, the planet will not begin to cool on its own. Ensuring that an “overshoot” of 1.5 degrees is temporary, then, requires removing even more carbon from the atmosphere than is being emitted — it requires achieving “net-negative” emissions.

Suffice it to say, you will not find the words “net negative” in any COP agreements. “If 1.5 degrees C is to remain the core temperature goal, then net zero can no longer be seen as an end point but only as a transition point in climate policy,” Geden and Reisinger wrote. The two stress that this wouldn’t prevent all of the harms of going past that level of warming, but it would reduce risk, depending on the magnitude and duration of the overshoot.

I spoke to Geden on Thursday, while the UN climate conference was still underway in Belém, Brazil, about what policymakers are missing about overshoot and the 1.5 degree goal. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

I’ve had scientists tell me they don’t like the term “overshoot” because the 1.5 degree boundary is arbitrary. How do you think about it?

You can apply the concept of overshoot to any level. You could also apply it to 2 degrees or 1.6 or 1.7. It’s just saying that there is a defined level you care about, and it’s about exceeding that level and returning to it later. That is the basic concept, and then 1.5 is the logical application right now in terms of where climate policy is. That return idea is not very well represented, but that’s how it has been used in the IPCC for quite some time — exceedance and return.

What was the impetus for writing the article with Reisinger and what was your main message?

We wanted to explain the concept of overshoot because it seems that it’s now being discussed more. The UN secretary general started using it in a speech to the World Meteorological Association two weeks before Belém, and now has continuously done so. It also led to some irritation because people interpret it as, He just called 1.5 off, although he usually says, “Science tells us you can come back to it.”

These overshoot trajectories and pathways for 1.5 degrees have been around since at least the Special Report on 1.5 Degrees in 2018, and then increasingly dominated the modeling of 1.5. But we feel that the broader climate policy community never quite got the point that it is baked into these trajectories whenever scientists say 1.5 is still possible. But then this element of, what does this now mean? Who has to do what? How is it possible to get temperature down? That’s even more obscure, in a way, in the political debate, because it means net-zero CO2 is not enough. Net-zero CO2 would halt temperature increase. To get it down, you need to go net negative. And then the obvious question, politically, would be, who’s going to do that?

In the paper, you write that the amount of net-negative emissions required to reduce global average temperatures by just 0.1 degrees is about equal to five years of current annual emissions, or 100x our current annual carbon removal, which is mostly from planting trees. Given that, is it realistic to talk about reversing warming?

That’s not for me to say. If you think about the trajectory — how would, let’s say, a temperature trajectory in the 21st century look? What you would get now is a peak warming level above 1.5. Then really the question is, what happens afterwards? If everybody only talks about going to net-zero CO2 then we should assume it’s that new peak temperature level, and then we just stay there. But if you want to say the world needs to go back down to 1.5 by the end of the century then we have to talk about net-negative levels, and we still may find out that it’s not realistic.

This kind of circumvents the conversation of how good we look on getting to net zero. We all assume that’s doable. I also assume that’s doable. But you cannot forget the fact that right now, our emissions are still rising.

One of the policy implications you write about in the piece is that if Europe were to set a target to go net negative, its carbon pricing scheme could go from a source of income to a financial burden. Can you explain that?

If you have carbon pricing and you have emitters, you can finance carbon dioxide removal through the revenues from carbon pricing. But if you want to go net negative, you need more removals than you have emissions. The question is, who’s going to pay for it? You would always have residual emitters, but if you want to go deeply into net negative, you will run out of revenue sources to finance these removals.

One of the big problems is, conceptually, a government can say, Okay, your factory does not have a license to produce anymore, and you can force it to close down. But you cannot force any entity to remove CO2 for you. So how can a government guarantee that these removals are really going to happen? Would the acceleration of this carbon dioxide removal actually work? Which methods do we prefer? Do we have enough geological storage? It’s all unresolved. This paper is not a call to Europe to say hey, just make a promise. [It’s saying,] can you please really think about it? Can we please stop assuming somebody is going to organize all this to go net negative and then it magically happens? You need to make a serious plan. And you may find out that it’s too hard to do.

Another question is, how will other actors react? I think that’s part of the reluctance to talk about going net negative. The mental model right now of being a frontrunner is going down to the net zero line and then waiting there for the others to come. But if you enter net negative territory, it becomes basically bottomless. So every developing country could, reasonably so, demand ever higher levels of you. In the European Union, where you have 27 member states, even there, you would get into distributional challenges because some member states may ask others to go net negative because they are disadvantaged.

Also, which sectors would be forced to go net negative, which ones can stay net positive? Agriculture, at least as long as you have livestock, will be net positive. Then you have a country like Ireland, with 30% of the emissions coming from agriculture. They will stay a net-positive country, probably, and then others would have to go net negative. So you can imagine what kind of tensions you would get in.

I know you’re not in Belém, but from what you’ve read and from what you’re hearing, do you think that overshoot and all of these questions that you raise are being discussed more there? Do you get the sense that they are making their way into the conversation more?

A bit. The talk you hear is only just about 1.5 and 1.5-aligned, and it makes you wonder what governments or NGOs think, how this is going to happen. In the text presented by the Brazilian government, overshoot is mentioned, and “limiting or minimizing magnitude and duration of overshoot.” But it does not talk about what that actually means.

The whole 1.5 conversation, I think it’s hard for governments to understand. At the same they’re getting told, “if you just look at the pledges, you will end up at 2.6 or 2.7 or 2.8 by the end of the century, you have to do more.” Of course they all have to do more, but to really get to 1.5 they have to do more than they can imagine. If the world does not want to cross 1.5, never ever, it would need to be at net-zero CO2 in 2030, between 2030 and 2035. And if you go later, then you have to go net negative. It’s actually quite easy, but it seems to be uncomfortable knowledge. And then the way we communicate the challenge — governments, scientists, media — it’s not very straightforward.

All these temperature targets are special in the sense that they set an absolute target. Usually policymakers, governments, set relative targets, like 0.7% of national GDP for overseas development aid — you can miss that every year, but then you can say, next year we’re going to meet it. That logic does not apply here. Once you are there, you are there. Then it’s not enough to say that next year we are going to put more effort into it. You just then can limit the extra damage.

The final resolution that concluded the United Nations climate summit in Brazil made no mention of fossil fuels, in what The New York Times called “a victory for oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia.” But the so-called COP30 confab in the northeastern Amazonian city of Belém made some notable progress. This was the first conference to seriously broach the effects of mining the metals needed for the energy transition, as I wrote here last week. The event had other firsts, as the Financial Times noted: It was the first completely spurned by the U.S. administration, “the first since the world hit 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming for an entire calendar year,” and — it turned out — “the first with a venue plagued by extreme heat, flooding — even a fire that brought the talks to a standstill for much of their second-last day.” But, FT columnist Pilita Clark continued, Brazil’s turn at the yearly summit “still managed something these huge annual gatherings should have done years ago: a shift away from showy pledges to tackling the real world complexities of cutting carbon emissions.”

The COP30 statement “does not spell out the implications or required response as bluntly as many want to see,” Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote, “It does, however, introduce an important new concept that could become a key part of the negotiations in the future. For the first time, the text references a resolve to ‘limit both the magnitude and duration of any temperature overshoot.’ This not only acknowledges that it’s possible to bring temperatures back down after warming surpasses 1.5 degrees, but that the level at which temperatures peak, and the length of time we remain at that peak before the world begins to cool, are just as important. The statement implies the need for a much larger conversation about carbon removal that has been nearly absent from the annual COPs, but which scientists say that countries must have if they are serious about the Paris Agreement goals.”

2. U.S. Export-Import Bank will invest $100 billion in ‘energy dominance’

The U.S. Export-Import Bank plans to invest $100 billion in overseas energy projects to promote President Donald Trump’s global energy dominance. The first tranche of funding will go to projects in Egypt, Pakistan, and Europe. In his first interview since taking office in September, the federal lender’s newly-appointed chair, John Jovanovic, told the FT the administration was focusing the bank on “efforts to secure U.S. and allied supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear energy, and liquified natural gas to counter western reliance on China and Russia.” In short, Jovanovic said, the Ex-Im Bank is “back in a big way, and it’s open for business.”

3. Wyoming is planning America’s first new coal plant in 12 years

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon last week announced $4 million in state matching funds to study building a second coal-fired unit at the Dry Fork Station power plant in Gillette. The move, Cowboy State Daily reported, “could be the first step toward building a new coal-fired power plant” in the sparsely populated state’s third-largest city. “This is clear proof that coal is not dead and a reminder that Wyoming’s strength has always come from our ability to innovate without abandoning our values,” Gordon, a Republican, said in a statement. If built, the plant would be the first new coal-fired unit to open in the U.S. since 2013.

The Trump administration is trying to keep existing coal plants open. But it’s running into the problem that their equipment keeps breaking down, as Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin wrote. The trend toward coal isn’t unique to Trump’s America. Coal demand is rising globally.

4. Oregon’s governor orders sweeping review of clean energy bottlenecks

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek ordered state agencies last week to speed up the government’s performance on permitting, energy efficiency, electrification, and low-carbon fuel. In a speech, the Democrat said her administration would pursue the cheapest pathway to the state’s 2040 target of decarbonizing electricity, E&E News reported. “We’re talking about what we really need to meet our [climate] goals in an affordable way… where we’re not getting help from the federal government,” Kotek said Wednesday at a press conference.

Democratic states are largely in a moment of flux on climate policy. California eased permitting restrictions and passed a series of bills on energy and emissions, as Emily laid out at the time. As I reported here last week, Pennsylvania took the opposite approach and withdrew from the multi-state cap-and-trade market under pressure to contain costs. New York, meanwhile, has required a federal judge to intervene to force its government to enforce climate regulations. It's all part of the emerging tension between Democrats' affordability campaigns and the party's desire to cut planet-heating pollution, as Heatmap's Robinson Meyer wrote.

5. British oil and gas developer Harbour Energy is pumped on the U.S.

Regular readers of this newsletter scarcely need reminding of two basic realities about the American oil and gas industry right now: Trump is opening virtually everywhere he can to production, but drilling has largely remained flat. But the market is looking good to the British developer Harbour Energy. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Linda Cook, the company’s chief executive, said Harbour Energy is exploring a potential acquisition or merger with rivals in the U.S. offshore and onshore drilling business as a way to enter “the biggest market in the world” where the London-headquartered firm isn’t already present. In a sign of confidence in Trump’s as-yet-unrealized promise to “drill, baby, drill,” Harbour Energy has widened its scope from its past inquiries into only U.S. offshore assets to also look at onshore drilling.

THE KICKER

Beyond COP30, Brazil has at least one more first. The country’s National Nuclear Energy Commission approved construction of Latin America’s first nuclear waste repository, set to start next year, World Nuclear News reported. While Brazil is one of the only nations in the region with atomic energy, the country has just two reactors. Despite approaching nuclear power more hesitantly than neighboring Argentina, breaking ground on the first storage site would signal a significant step forward for the nascent industry in South America.

After conversations with multiple former agency staffers, including a senior political appointee who helped lead the Biden-era reorganization in 2022, here’s what stood out to me:

1. ‘This seems sloppy.’

The spring 2022 overhaul Jennifer Granholm, former President Joe Biden’s secretary of energy, oversaw came with a detailed legal memo and extensive explanations about what the changes would mean.

“Overall, this seems sloppy,” the former senior staffer who led that process told me this morning. “If you’re trying to carry out a very coherent energy dominance strategy, you’d at least explain which boxes are moving where and what’s sitting under those boxes.”

Announcing the changes with so little detail, the former official said, “seems like a fundamental lack of leadership.”

“This, to me, just seems reckless,” the appointee continued. “People who are sitting within these offices don’t know where they’re going to work virtually on Monday.”

That, of course, may change by the end of today once the Energy Department holds its town hall meeting.

2. A lot of power is going to a new office led by a deputy close to Wright.

It’s unusual for an office at the agency to report directly to the secretary. Those that do typically straddle multiple types of responsibilities within the agency. For example, the Office of Technology Transitions reported directly to Granholm under the Biden administration because its purview fell under both research and deployment. The Office of Policy functions similarly. But the newly-created Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation absorbed not only various mining-related sections of the agency, but also the now-defunct Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. That puts a lot of money and grant-making powers under the new office.

Leading the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation will be Audrey Robertson, who was confirmed last month as the assistant secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. A former investment banker and oil executive, Robertson served on the board of directors of Wright’s former company, the fracking giant Liberty Energy, until earlier this year. Another agency source familiar with the organization said “it makes no sense for this office not to answer to an undersecretary of energy.”

“Audrey is Wright’s person,” the source told me.

That, the other former agency official told me, creates some political liabilities for Wright.

“For departmental oversight reasons, that’s a lot of grant-making money and authorities that typically you’d want to layer under additional oversight before it goes to the secretary,” the ex-official said. “This is the thing that sticks out like a sore thumb.”

3. Some of the moves follow a clear, if arguably partisan, logic.

All that said about the new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, no one can blame Wright for wanting to consolidate some of the bureaucracy. One way to read the decision to eliminate certain offices, such as the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains or the Office of State and Community Energy Programs, is that the new administration wanted to undo the changes made under its predecessor in 2022. While manufacturing work included a lot of what the U.S. is doing with batteries, funding for that work fell under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

“A lot of the moves that they’re doing to re-consolidate offices aligns with what was technically under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which directed battery work to go through EERE,” one of the sources told me. “So some of this is realignment back to the original congressional direction.”

4. No one’s getting fired — yet.

The stop-gap funding bill that reopened the government after the longest shutdown in history included a measure to prevent any dismissals until January 30.

But it’s unclear whether the agency plans to terminate workers as part of the reorganization starting in February.

5. Fusion is getting its own office.

In a sign that the Trump administration is taking efforts to commercialize fusion energy technology more seriously, the reorganization gives fusion its own office, moving the work out of the Office of Science.

“Overall this is a win for the private-fusion sector, and further cements a move from a discovery-based research model to milestone-driven, commercialization-focused policy,” Stuart Allen, the chief executive of the investment company FusionX Group, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “All signs point to a federal strategy increasingly aligned and enmeshed with the rapid advancement of fusion energy.”

6. Geothermal is linking up with fossil fuels.

Under the new structure, geothermal and fossil fuels will live together under the new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.

There are some obvious synergies. The new generation of geothermal startups racing toward commercialization rely on drilling techniques such as fracking to tap into hot rocks in places that conventional companies couldn’t. Oil and gas companies are excited about the industry; Sage Geosystems, one of the big players, is led by the former head of Shell’s fracking division. And notably, most of the big companies, including Sage, Fervo Energy, and XGS Energy (whom I have written about twice recently in these pages) are all headquartered in Big Oil’s capital of Houston, Texas.

7. Hydropower ended up in a weird spot.

Nuclear power has long had its own office at the Energy Department, and that won’t change. But you’d think that the other source of clean baseload power that the Trump administration has anointed as one of its preferred generating sources might get slotted in with geothermal. Instead, however, hydropower is in Robertson’s mega-office.

8. Nuclear weapons are being left alone.

Unsurprisingly, the bulk of the Energy Department’s work that deals with the nation’s nuclear arsenal was largely left untouched by the changes. Perhaps the agency had enough drama from the Department of Government Efficiency’s dismissals of critical workers in the early days of the administration, which led to an embarrassing effort to reverse the firings.

9. There’s still open questions about things like the hydrogen hubs.

As was widely expected, the reorg killed the Biden-era Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which the new administration had already gutted. What becomes of key programs that office managed is still a mystery. Chief among them: the hydrogen hubs.

The Energy Department yanked funding for the two regional hubs on the West Coast last month, as Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorovo reported at the time. A leaked list that the administration has yet to confirm as real proposed defunding all seven of the hubs. It’s unclear whether that may happen. If it doesn’t, it’s unclear where those billions of dollars may go. The most obvious place is under Robertson’s portfolio, ballooning the budget under her control by billions.

10. The Loan Programs Office is now the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.

When Wright announced the first totally new loan issued under the agency’s in-house lender earlier this week, he trumpeted his new approach the Loan Programs Office. He wanted to refashion the entity with its lending authority of nearly $400 billion as a source of funding primarily for the nuclear industry. The first big loan issued Tuesday afternoon went to utility giant Constellation to finance the restart of the functional reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear station. But at a press conference last month, Wright hinted at the new branding, as Emily called in this piece. It’s now the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.

The new office isn’t just the LPO, however. The $2.5 billion Transmission Facility Financing Program will also fall under the new so-called EDF — an acronym it will aptly share with France’s biggest utility, which came under state control recently as part of Paris’ efforts to refurbish and expand the country’s vast nuclear fleet.

11. With all that in mind, some coverage of these changes was a little overblown.

I’ll leave it to my source to level a critique at my colleagues in this industry:

“Even in The New York Times today there’s an article that says all these offices are eliminated,” one of the sources told me. “Their names were eliminated, but a lot of the projects for whatever remains that they haven’t terminated are just being reassigned.” The Wall Street Journal had a similar angle.

The actual thing to watch for, the source said, was how job descriptions change.

“What’s going to be more telling is when they have a new, updated mission of the Office of Electricity or a new, updated mission of the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIzMzgyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODQzNzA5NH0.FFXxlhlOjTyIDTnKYyULuoiP-Jv2XaItoSKK9lM2Zdw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-24 19:01:26.488732

CV-SALTS Progress Report: Addressing nitrate and salt contamination in the Central Valley

“In 2006, the Central Valley Regional Water Board launched the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term Sustainability (CV-SALTS) program to tackle the growing issue of nitrate and salt contamination in groundwater and wells across the region. This collaborative initiative brings together regulators, agricultural and industrial dischargers, municipal wastewater agencies, and environmental and environmental justice organizations to develop and implement sustainable solutions. The program’s overarching goals are to support the San Joaquin Valley’s agricultural economy, ensure access to safe drinking water, and protect the environment. CV-SALTS focuses on two critical areas: long-term salinity management and nitrate management. A key emphasis is placed on providing safe drinking water to communities in high-priority areas of the San Joaquin Valley, where nitrate contamination poses significant health risks. On October 21, representatives from the Central Valley Regional Water Board and the Central Valley Salinity Coalition presented the sixth annual progress report to the State Water Board, offering updates on the program’s advancements and ongoing efforts. … ” Continue reading from Maven’s Notebook.

There’s a path forward in the San Joaquin Valley to benefit farmers, communities, and nature — but only if we plan . . . and plant

“For most of its history, California treated groundwater and surface water as legally distinct. Unlike surface water diversions, groundwater pumping was largely unrestricted until 2014 when the state passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which requires the parts of the state where groundwater is pumped more quickly than it is replenished to set limits on current and future groundwater pumping. In the San Joaquin Valley alone, pumping exceeded replenishment by 2 million acre-feet per year for the three decades prior to 2014. To meet the goals of SGMA in the San Joaquin Valley, it is estimated that more than 500,000 acres of irrigated agricultural land will need to be retired by 2040 (Hanak et al. 2023). Repurposing land at this scale is a daunting challenge that requires strategic planning and tactical implementation. Without doing so, the negative aspects of abandoned or fallowed lands — such as worsening air quality, economic losses to farmers, and uninhabitable lands — are likely to be more severe, and we could miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore wildlife habitat in the valley. The good news is that conservation organizations, water agencies, local communities, and others have been planning and preparing for this transition — and our early efforts to demonstrate how land can be repurposed strategically and at scale to support groundwater sustainability and the recovery of imperiled species are bearing fruit. … ” Read more from California Agriculture.

Study: Data centers’ environmental impact rising, thanks to AI

“Thanks in large part to the training and running of artificial-intelligence models, the amount of power California data centers are using is surging — as are related environmental and health effects, according to a new report. The amount of power used by data centers in California nearly doubled between 2019 and 2023, and by 2028 could be more than double the 2023 total, according to a study by UC Riverside researchers published earlier this month by public and environmental advocacy group Next 10. Data-center carbon emissions and water consumption are expected to follow a similar trajectory over the 2019-2028 time period, according to the study. Meanwhile, pollution-related health costs linked to the state’s data centers more than tripled between 2019 and 2023. Although such costs will likely continue to grow, they’ll likely do so more slowly than power usage in coming years, according to the report. … ” Read more from the Washington Examiner.

How to make data centers less thirsty

“Data centers are notoriously thirsty. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have found that, in 2023, the facilities consumed roughly 17 billion gallons of water for their operations in the U.S. alone. But that’s only a small part of the picture: A much, much larger share of data center water-intensity is indirect, a byproduct of the facilities’ enormous appetites for energy. That’s because most power plants themselves require huge amounts of water to operate. This off-site, indirect water consumption amounted to a whopping 211 billion gallons in the Berkeley lab’s 2023 tally — well over 10 times the direct on-site usage. As Silicon Valley continues to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence and demand for data centers grows, these water needs are only going to grow in tandem. However, new research from Cornell University shows that there’s a way to mitigate both the climate and water footprints of these facilities: build them in places with lots of wind and solar energy. “Location really matters,” said Fengqi You, an energy systems engineering professor at Cornell and co-author of the new study. Where companies choose to locate their data centers could alter their combined environmental footprints by a factor of up to 100. … ” Read more from Grist.

Beer made from recycled shower and laundry water available in select states

“If you feel like you’ve tried just about every beer on the market, a California-based company is bringing brews made from an unexpected ingredient: recycled water. Epic Cleantec has announced that it will begin distributing its Shower Hour IPA and Laundry Club Kölsch across several states, including Oregon. The San Francisco-based business describes itself as a “pioneer in onsite water reuse solutions for the real estate industry.” It partnered with the San Carlos-based Devil’s Canyon Brewing Company to create the new products that feature shower and laundry water from the buildings that use Epic’s on-site purification systems. “As water and infrastructure challenges grow worldwide, buildings continue to discard perfectly good water with tremendous potential for reuse,” Epic Co-Founder and CEO Aaron Tartakovsky said in a release. “By creating Shower Hour IPA and Laundry Club Kölsch, we’re giving people a fun and approachable way to see recycled water in a new light. If a single great beer can change minds, imagine the impact of these advanced water reuse technologies when deployed at scale.” … ” Read more from Fox 5 San Diego.

California leaders blast Trump’s ‘reckless’ offshore drilling plan for the state

“California lawmakers on Thursday denounced the Trump administration’s proposal to open up six offshore lease sales in federal waters off the California coast, with Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the proposal “idiotic” and “reckless,” asserting it will not gain any traction in the state. The development follows reports earlier this month of a leaked draft of the plan, when Newsom — speaking from the U.N. climate summit in Brazil — reiterated his opposition, calling the proposal “dead on arrival” and referring to President Donald Trump as “the polluted heart of the climate crisis.” “This reckless attempt to sell out our coastline to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water,” Newsom said in a statement released shortly after the announcement on the plan was dropped. “Californians remember the environmental and economic devastation of past oil spills. For decades, California has stood firm in our opposition to new offshore drilling, and nothing will change that. We will use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.” … ” Read more from the Sacramento Bee.

One of Tahoe’s biggest ski resorts will open soon

“A 20-inch snowfall has enabled Heavenly Mountain Resort to salvage its winter kickoff, clearing the way for the South Lake Tahoe ski giant to open Monday after a stint of unseasonably warm weather delayed its planned Friday debut. Vail Resorts, which owns a trio of major ski resorts in the area, announced Heavenly’s opening day in a press release Saturday. But the opening date for the company’s Northstar California Resort remained uncertain. Staff for Northstar, near Truckee, are still monitoring conditions and manufacturing snow. Kirkwood, south of the Tahoe basin, remains on track for its Dec. 5 opening, the company said. Heavenly, Northstar and several other Sierra ski resorts typically hustle to open some downhill terrain before Thanksgiving by running their snow guns whenever colder temperatures allow. But those efforts have been stymied this season by warm weather. … ” Read more from the San Francisco Chronicle.

Bay Area’s ultra-wealthy keep buying homes in this beach town — despite doomsday forecast

“Stinson Beach, beloved for its long strip of white sand and seaside cottages, was just named one of the nation’s most expensive markets for homebuyers. It may not last forever, however, as climate change is due to bring the surf ever higher, claiming more of the beach with each decade. It’s not the paradox that it appears to be, real estate experts say. Ultra-wealthy homebuyers love Stinson, and unlike most Americans, they can take a chance on their biggest assets. They also have the money for projects that may ward off the worst effects of sea level rise. “I don’t think anyone thinks sea level rise isn’t going to happen,” said Ashley Bird, a third-generation agent at Seadrift Realty, which currently represents two Stinson Beach houses listed at over $10 million. “They know they’re taking a huge financial risk. They’re just willing to take the risk because they love Stinson so much.” … ” Read more from the San Francisco Chronicle. | Read via MSN News.

The reopening plan was approved last week by the EBMUD Board of Directors for the San Pablo Reservoir in the East Bay and the Camanche Reservoir South Shore in the Sierra foothills. The plan requires inspection of all trailered vessels and a mandatory 30-day quarantine and banding before they will be allowed to launch, according to EBMUD.

Lake Havasu Fisheries Improvement Program marks 30 years of stewardship, science, and community partnership

“As anglers around the world celebrate World Fisheries Day, a remarkable success story is unfolding on the shores of Lake Havasu: the Lake Havasu Fisheries Improvement Program is quietly entering its fourth decade as one of the nation’s most effective public-private conservation partnerships. What began in 1992 as an urgent response to declining fish habitat has transformed the 19,300-acre reservoir into a premier fishery renowned for trophy striped bass, giant redear sunfish, and thriving sportfish populations. The secret? Thirty years of science-driven habitat restoration, interagency cooperation, and the tireless work of volunteers—many of them retired anglers who refuse to let the lake’s underwater forests disappear. “It’s a true example of what happens when government agencies, nonprofits, and the public roll up their sleeves together,” said Bureau of Land Management (BLM) fisheries biologist Rachel Wirick, who leads the program from the Arizona Lake Havasu Field Office. “This lake doesn’t manage itself.

Along the Colorado River …

Zebra mussels threaten infrastructure and native ecosystems. Utah and Colorado are ramping up efforts to detect and contain them.

“On a bluebird day at West and East Lake in Grand Junction, Maddie Baker throws a plankton tow net into the water, and drags it back to her. “This is made of a 64 micrometer mesh, so that allows us to trap the veligers in their juvenile form, where they are microscopic and invisible to the eye,” she said. Baker is an invasive species specialist for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. A veliger is the larval form of many kinds of mollusks, including the invasive—and pervasive—zebra mussel. Baker doesn’t have to tow the plankton net to know the mussels are here. She picks mussel after mussel off of a concrete platform that gives anglers access to the lake. These zebra mussels are small, about the size of dimes (though they can grow bigger) and the little brown stripes that give the species their name are only just visible. “It sucks,” she said. “It’s a very unfortunate realization for us to come to.

Explaining the decline in WIFIA loan volume: Part 1

“What is happening at EPA’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan program? The mysterious issue is not the near-complete cessation of loan closings under Trump 2.0. The reason for that is clearer: the Office of Management and Budget’s pause on federal grants and loans in February combined with continuing federal upheaval under this administration. Much harder to explain is the steady decline in program loan volume since the end of 2021 through January 2025, despite rising U.S. water sector capex. During this period, WIFIA had a supportive Biden administration, plenty of funding and was run as efficiently as ever. Yet, the program’s annual executed loan volume fell from a calendar year peak in 2021 of over $5.5 billion to under $2 billion in 2024. … ” Read more from Water Finance & Management.

EPA just approved new ‘forever chemical’ pesticides for use on food

“The Environmental Protection Agency is moving forward with approvals for pesticides containing “forever chemicals” as an active ingredient, dismissing concerns about health and environmental impacts raised by some scientists and activists.This month, the agency approved two new pesticides that meet the internationally recognized definition for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or fluorinated substances, and has announced plans for four additional approvals. The authorized pesticides, cyclobutrifluram and isocycloseram, which was approved Thursday, will be used on vegetables such as romaine lettuce, broccoli and potatoes. The agency also announced plans to relax a rule requiring companies to report all products containing PFAS and has proposed weakening drinking water standards for the chemicals. “Many fluorinated compounds registered or proposed for U.S. pesticidal use in recent years offer unique benefits for farmers, users, and the public,” EPA spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said in a statement. … ” Read more from the Washington Post.

Watered Down: U.S. policy retrenchment leaves trail of broken engagements, unfinished infrastructure, weakened institutions, and diminished water security

“Water is a critical resource. Modern societies require sustainable supplies of safe, sufficient water for drinking, cooking, and cleaning, as well as to grow food, generate energy, promote industry, and ensure public health. Yet many countries and communities worldwide struggle to provide reliable water services for their people. Water resources are renewable, but they are unevenly distributed. Rainfall and river flows vary season to season and place to place. Extreme events such as floods and droughts can imperil water systems and water users. Contaminants can render water sources unsafe. Accessing, treating, storing, and delivering clean fresh water where and when it is needed; protecting water systems from extremes and disasters; and sustaining water resources to meet evolving demands requires substantial financial investment, infrastructure development, and managerial capability. These demands strain the capacities of many societies. Today, one-quarter of the global population lacks access to safely managed drinking water and two in every five people around the world do not have safely managed sanitation. … ” Continue reading at Circle of Blue.

From invasive species tracking to water security – what’s lost with federal funding cuts at US Climate Adaptation Science Centers

“When the Trump administration began freezing federal funding for climate and ecosystem research, one of the programs hit hard was ours: the U.S. Geological Survey’s Climate Adaptation Science Centers. These nine regional centers help fish, wildlife, water, land – and, importantly, people – adapt to rising global temperatures and other climate shifts. The centers have been helping to track invasive species, protect water supplies and make agriculture more sustainable in the face of increasing drought conditions. They’re improving wildfire forecasting, protecting shorelines and saving Alaska salmon, among many other projects. All of this work happens through partnerships: Scientists, many of them affiliated with universities, team up with public and private resource managers – the people who manage water supplies, wildlands, recreation areas, shorelines and other natural resources – to develop the research and solutions those managers need. But in spring 2025, after 15 years of operation of the centers, the president’s proposed federal budget zeroed out funding for them. Federal workers at the centers were threatened with layoffs. … ” Read more from The Conversation.

We are at a pivotal moment where the Canadian energy policy outlook could undergo a significant transformation, potentially reshaping North American energy markets. This blog will explore the nuances of a prospective Alberta-Ottawa energy deal, examining how evolving market conditions and policy shifts could unlock Canada’s vast energy potential.

Shifting Tides: A New Alberta-Ottawa Energy Deal on the Horizon

The energy sector in Canada has grappled for years with regulatory hurdles, often summarized as the “nine bad laws” that have stifled investment and project development. However, recent discussions between Alberta and Ottawa suggest a willingness to revisit these legislative frameworks. This prospective Alberta-Ottawa energy deal could pave the way for a more predictable investment climate, directly impacting the viability of future energy projects.

North American Supply Dynamics and Canadian Oil Pipeline Development

A critical factor influencing Canada’s energy future is the evolving supply picture in the United States. We’ve observed a plateauing in U.S. oil production, a trend that creates a significant opening for increased Canadian crude exports. The impacts of this change are profound, underscoring the enduring need for reliable supply sources from stable jurisdictions. Consequently, the impetus for new Canadian oil pipeline development gains renewed urgency. While such projects face long lead times, the current more optimistic demand outlook, coupled with a transparent policy environment, could accelerate necessary infrastructure expansions. These pipelines are not just about moving oil; they are about securing market access and enhancing energy security for North America, albeit at some environmental cost.

The LNG Canada Project Future and Global Demand

Beyond crude oil, Canada holds immense potential in natural gas, particularly in the realm of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The Shell-led, $40 billion LNG Canada project , located on the coast of British Columbia, represents a significant opportunity to supply global markets with the fuel. The timeline for such large-scale infrastructure projects is inherently long, often spanning many years from conception to operation. However, the global demand outlook for LNG remains robust, driven by energy transition efforts and the need for reliable baseload power. A supportive Canadian energy policy outlook would help ensure the timely completion and expansion of such projects, positioning Canada as a key player in the global energy transition.

Forward-Looking Conclusion

The confluence of a potential Alberta-Ottawa energy agreement, plateauing U.S. oil production, and sustained global energy demand growth presents a unique window of opportunity for Canada. For traders, analysts and risk managers, understanding these intricate dynamics is paramount. We anticipate a more amenable Canadian energy policy framework will facilitate potential investment in both oil and gas infrastructure, including Canadian oil pipeline development and development of new LNG projects as well as the expansion of LNG Canada. By leveraging its vast resources and fostering a stable regulatory environment, Canada can solidify its role as a crucial and responsible energy provider, ensuring market stability and driving economic growth for decades to come.

(NASDAQ: EOSE) (“Eos” or the “Company”), America’s leading innovator in the design, sourcing, and manufacturing of zinc-based long duration energy storage (LDES) systems, manufactured in the United States, announced the closing of its previously announced offering of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2031, including the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional notes (the “Convertible Notes Offering”), for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $580.5 million. Following the exercise of the option, $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due 2031 were issued and outstanding.

Concurrently, Eos announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering of 35,855,647 shares of common stock at a price of $12.78 per share to a limited number of purchasers (the “Common Stock Offering” and, together with the Convertible Notes Offering, the “Offerings”), for aggregate proceeds of approximately $458.2 million.

The financing represents a significant strengthening of Eos’ balance sheet, providing the financial flexibility needed to scale manufacturing, accelerate commercial pipeline and backlog conversion, and capture rapidly expanding demand for American-made long duration energy storage. The offerings were oversubscribed, demonstrating strong investor confidence in Eos’ market potential and progress against its strategic plan.

“This was an opportunistic move to strengthen Eos for the scale in front of us,” said Nathan Kroeker, Eos Chief Commercial Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. “Retiring a significant portion of the 2030 notes and securing a lower cost of capital while bringing in meaningful new cash gives us the flexibility to support manufacturing expansion and the growing demand for long-duration energy storage.”

The refinancing meaningfully enhances the Company’s capital structure by lowering its cost of capital, reducing interest expense, and adding substantial liquidity to support the next phase of operational growth and U.S.-based production. This strengthened position comes as Eos’ commercial pipeline has reached $22.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, representing approximately 91 GWh of identified long duration energy storage demand across data centers, utilities, and industrial customers, supporting the Company’s plans to scale manufacturing to meet evolving market needs.

“This financing positions Eos to compete from a position of strength,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “With a stronger balance sheet and a more efficient capital structure, we can scale with speed and certainty at a time when the world is entering an energy supercycle. Long-duration storage is becoming essential infrastructure, and this transaction gives Eos the ability to invest in U.S. manufacturing, meet accelerating demand, and lead the market as this cycle unfolds.”

Use of Proceeds

Proceeds from the Offerings were used to:

Repurchase $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 6.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030.

Add approximately $474 million of cash to the balance sheet as adjusted for the Offerings, net of initial purchaser discounts and commissions, prior to the deduction of expenses.

Department of Energy Warrants

Concurrently, the Company announced the issuance to the U.S. Department of Energy of a warrant to purchase up to 570,000 shares of common stock. As part of the Trump Administration’s review of the Office of Energy Dominance Financing loan portfolio, both parties collaborated to strengthen the transaction structure: Eos secured from the DOE the flexibility to pursue advantageous private market capital as its business scales rapidly, while the DOE gained the mechanism to share in potential equity upside that eventually can be converted into additional return for the U.S. government.

Public Warrants

In addition to the financing, and in the fourth quarter, holders of Eos public warrants exercised approximately 7 million warrants prior to the expiration, adding an additional $80.2 million of cash to the balance sheet. The combined effect of the warrants exercised and financing further enhances the Company’s liquidity and advances its path toward sustained manufacturing scale and commercial execution.

Trump on Friday issued a proclamation exempting facilities known as coke ovens from a rule limiting their releases of pollutants, such as mercury, formaldehyde, soot and dioxins.
Coke ovens are chambers where coal is heated to produce coke, which is a fuel that’s used in steelmaking.
“Specifically, the Coke Oven Rule requires compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially demonstrated or cost-effective form,” it continued.
The Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year set up a portal to make it easier for companies to request exemptions to Clean Air Act rules.","President Trump is exempting coal used in steelmaking from Biden-era Clean Air Act regulations for two years.

Trump on Friday issued a proclamation exempting facilities known as coke ovens from a rule limiting their releases of pollutants, such as mercury, formaldehyde, soot and dioxins.

The rule that the facilities were exempted from also would have required them to monitor for a separate cancer-causing chemical called benzene at the fence line of their facility.

Coke ovens are chambers where coal is heated to produce coke, which is a fuel that’s used in steelmaking.

When it issued the rule, the EPA estimated it would apply to 11 facilities, costing them about $500,000 each for compliance. The Trump exemption applies to 11 facilities.

The Biden administration said its rule was not necessarily expected to cut pollution, but it could prevent future pollution increases.

This is because all of the facilities in question have pollution levels below the limits set in the rule, but the rule would have been expected to require them to install technology to detect emissions that are over the limits, “allowing for earlier corrective action and thus preventing pollution increases that could otherwise occur.”

Trump, in his proclamation, argued that the technology required by the rule is not yet commercially viable and that steel production is important for the country.

“The Coke Oven Rule places severe burdens on the coke production industry and, through its indirect effects, on the viability of our Nation’s critical infrastructure, defense, and national security,” the proclamation said.

“Specifically, the Coke Oven Rule requires compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially demonstrated or cost-effective form,” it continued.

But observers criticized the exemptions.

“Here was a very low-cost, common-sense way for coke oven operators to make sure that they weren’t spewing benzene into the backyards of their neighbors,” Tosh Sagar, senior attorney at Earthjustice, told The Hill.

“Rather than do this very low-cost, common-sense thing to protect people, these… companies went and lobbied the president for this unprecedented and unwarranted exemption,” Sagar added.

Companies gaining exemptions under the proclamation are: EES Coke, ABC Coke, SunCoke Energy, U.S. Steel and Cleveland Cliffs.

The Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year set up a portal to make it easier for companies to request exemptions to Clean Air Act rules.

Since that time, the Trump administration has exempted dozens of polluters from regulations, including oil refineries, coal plants and medical device sterilizers.

Batteries to store excess solar at sporting fields, more EV charging and the community pool going electric are just some of the projects the Albanese Government is backing with its $100 million Community Energy Upgrades Fund.

Whether it’s the neighbourhood sports club, the community hall, the local pool or library, local government brings us together and keeps us thriving. The Albanese Government is working with councils, so they can save on their bills and invest more into their communities.

In the second round of the fund 66 local governments across Australia will receive $50 million in grants, empowering them to bring down their energy bills for good through energy efficiency and electrification upgrades to community facilities.

In Queensland, 12 councils will share in $4.3 million to upgrade much loved community facilities with energy-efficient technology, with benefits to be enjoyed by communities from Toowoomba to Pormpuraaw.

Member for Leichhardt, Matt Smith, will visit Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Shire Council to announce a grant of $256,735 to install solar panels on council residential properties. This upgrade will reduce costs for staff and other residents while feeding excess energy back into the grid, reducing impact on Traditional land.

Toowoomba’s Milne Bay Aquatic and Fitness Centre will replace gas-fired heating systems with high-efficiency electric heat pumps, supported by an energy system redesign and rooftop solar PV. The measures will significantly lower energy bills and emissions at the Toowoomba Regional Council facility, paving the way to its full decarbonisation.

Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council east of Cairns will replace non-operational solar PV systems on key Council-owned buildings with modern, high-efficiency panels. Part of the Yarrabah Microgrid, a community-led plan to strengthen energy resilience and reduce emissions, the upgrades will target commercial buildings to cut energy costs and support clean energy jobs in the remote community.

Almost all projects include solar panels and over half will include battery storage systems.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen:

“Generations of Australians have enjoyed and benefitted from facilities in the local community, and with this latest round of funding from the Albanese Government, we are ensuring that these facilities can invest more into their work for their local communities.

“From the local cricket ground, story time at the library, and diving into the local pool at the height of summer, these upgrades will deliver a cheaper, cleaner energy future for Australia - it’s further proof that what’s good for the planet is good for the pocket.”

Quotes attributable to Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Josh Wilson:

“We are investing in a cheaper, cleaner energy future for every Australian.

“This program will see benefits for public facilities like local swimming pools where gas boilers will be replaced with electric alternatives to reduce energy use, cut emissions, and help local governments reduce their running costs.”

Quotes attributable to Special Envoy for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience, Kate Thwaites:

“Local governments are on the front line of climate impacts, from floods to heatwaves. By investing in clean energy, we’re helping them build resilience and keep their communities strong.”

“Whether it’s a pool, a library or a sports ground, these projects show how practical climate action can save money today and protect communities for the future.”

“The Albanese Government is making sure every community has the tools to adapt and thrive as we transition to cleaner, cheaper energy.”

Member for Leichhardt, Matt Smith MP:

""This investment in renewable energy will reduce reliance on diesel generators, lower costs for rate payers and provide power for both houses and major community infrastructure in communities on the cape and the Torres Strait.

On November 12, Toyota began production at its first battery factory outside Japan: a USD14 billion, 1,850 acre complex in Liberty, North Carolina, expected to create up to 5,100 jobs and supply batteries for both hybrid and fully electric vehicles. Toyota stated that, beginning in 2026, it will shift production of the Toyota RAV4s to 100-percent hybrid, and it expects plug-in hybrid vehicles to make up 20 percent of its overall US production. The company also announced an additional USD10 billion investment in its US operations over the next five years.

Ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles commit to developing zero-emissions infrastructure. On November 10, the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners unanimously approved a binding cooperative agreement with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the Port of Los Angeles that sets enforceable deadlines for developing zero-emission infrastructure across the nation’s busiest port complex. The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, known as the San Pedro Port Complex, handle 40 percent of all container cargo entering the US and, according to the Los Angeles Times, are the single largest source of smog-forming pollution in Southern California, releasing more emissions than the region’s six million cars each day. Approved by SCAQMD on November 7, the framework includes substantial enforcement provisions, with penalties ranging from USD50,000 to USD200,000 per violation. Those funds will be directed toward projects benefiting communities near the ports. The agreement outlines a phased approach to achieving zero-emission operations, covering multiple equipment types by May 2027, with finalized plans for all categories to be in place by the end of 2029. These commitments build on the Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP), a collaboration between the ports that since 2005 has guided them to reduce their emissions of diesel particulate matter by 90 percent, nitrogen oxides by 68 percent, and sulfur oxides by 98 percent.

North American manufacturers cut orders of raw materials amid weak supply chain conditions. Manufacturers in North America significantly reduced their purchases of raw materials and intermediate goods in October, according to the latest data from the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index. The Index registered at -0.33 globally in October, showing that supply chain capacity is not being fully utilized. In North America, the Index fell to its lowest level since March: -0.45. This decline reportedly suggests a possible slowdown in production within North America, reflecting a global environment characterized by underutilized supply chains. Chinese factories are also reducing input buying, the Index reported, increasing spare capacity across Asia’s suppliers. Based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses worldwide, the Volatility Index tracks demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs. The next release of the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index will be in December.

Navigating US congressional inquiries: Key considerations for non-US companies. United States congressional inquiries have become an important instrument to shape policy agendas, test industry practices, influence public opinion, and apply pressure on industries and companies seen as politically relevant. Non-US companies can face unexpected obstacles in these matters due to a number of factors, including cross-border considerations, conflicting laws, and cultural differences. Our alert looks at practical challenges non-US companies may face in congressional inquiries and provides strategic considerations.

US releases 2025 list of critical minerals, adding ten new ones. On October 7, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published the final 2025 List of Critical Minerals in the Federal Register, adding ten new minerals to expand the 2022 list to 60 commodities. The new entries are boron, copper, lead, metallurgical coal, phosphate, potash, rhenium, silicon, silver, and uranium. These minerals were added to address supply chain vulnerabilities for industries like electronics, steelmaking, agriculture, renewable energy, nuclear power, and national defense. Last year, the US imported 80 percent of the rare earth elements it used. The expansion of the list reflects a strategic effort to bolster domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign sources for minerals essential to national security and the economy. Designating critical minerals unlocks expedited federal permitting under FAST-41, Defense Production Act funding, tax incentives, and streamlined reviews, potentially accelerating projects. The Department of Interior can also provide expedited permitting procedures for critical mineral projects.

UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill features revenue certainty mechanism. The second reading of the United Kingdom’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Bill took place in Parliament’s House of Lords on November 20. The bill, introduced this summer, is part of the government’s Jet Zero strategy, which has set a target of zero emissions from aviation by 2050. It would require all fuel suppliers to blend a minimum proportion of SAF into their fuels, starting at two percent and rising to 22 percent by 2040. Furthermore, to support investment in SAF production in the UK, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill introduces a new Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM). The RCM would ensure that clean fuel producers receive a guaranteed price for their fuel, offering long-term market stability and encouraging new investment – at present, the UK has only one SAF production plant. If the market price falls below a fixed point, the RCM would ensure that SAF producers are paid the difference. The mechanism would be funded through a levy imposed on UK aviation fuel suppliers, reflecting the ""Polluter Pays"" principle already enshrined in the Environmental Act 2021. Royal assent is expected by the end of 2026. The SAF Act is pursuant to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024, which went into effect on January 1 this year. Relatedly, in May, the UK Department of Transportation announced it would allocate an additional GBP400,000 in funding to support the testing and qualification of green fuels to get them to market more quickly.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16336_0535.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 19:01:07.708933

One of the major drivers of these gains are federal energy efficiency standards.
If it weren’t for energy efficiency standards, U.S. households would spend more than $500 extra on energy and water bills each year.
What are appliance and equipment energy efficiency standards?
Federal appliance energy efficiency standards set minimum energy or water efficiency requirements for certain products.","Fifty years ago, American homes were energy hogs. Refrigerators guzzled electricity. Heated air escaped through leaky walls. The amount of energy wasted was absurd. Today, much has changed for the better. Between environmental, health and financial savings, the energy efficiency gains we’ve scored in recent decades have been a win for everyone.

One of the major drivers of these gains are federal energy efficiency standards. Efficiency standards for equipment Americans use in their daily lives have been a mainstay of U.S. energy policy since the 1990s and states have been establishing their own policies and programs since the 1970s.

These standards save consumers energy – and the collective energy savings translate into massive environmental, health and financial gains. If it weren’t for energy efficiency standards, U.S. households would spend more than $500 extra on energy and water bills each year.

And there’s no reason that efficiency standards should stop delivering benefits for the American people. Experts predict that future appliance efficiency standards could save U.S. households an average of nearly $150 annually on their utility bills between 2030–2050. By 2040, future standards could reduce U.S. electricity consumption by an amount equivalent to nearly 5% of projected electricity consumption. Energy savings from future standards would also translate to real reductions in pollution. Future standards have the potential to lower carbon dioxide emissions by close to 1 billion metric tons through 2050 while also cutting pollutants that directly harm human health, including nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.

But unfortunately, much of the progress we have made on cutting energy waste is at risk.

The United States Congress is considering a bill that would undermine energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment.

What are appliance and equipment energy efficiency standards?

Federal appliance energy efficiency standards set minimum energy or water efficiency requirements for certain products. These standards save Americans money every day while reducing emissions by avoiding unnecessary energy generation and use. Updated periodically, the standards ensure that each generation of Americans can do more with less energy.

These standards are threatened by a new bill Congress is considering: H.R. 4626.

If passed, how would H.R. 4626 affect energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment?

H.R. 4626 would put today’s appliance energy saving and water saving standards at risk and threaten the ability to strengthen them as technology continues to improve. H.R. 4626 would give the administration new powers to roll back today’s standards. It would also direct the Department of Energy (DOE) to “evaluate” standards in the two years after they are finalized – creating immediate uncertainty for manufacturers, who invest in upgrading their product lines to prepare for set compliance dates.

H.R. 4626 goes further still: if a product’s efficiency standard is successfully gutted under the bill, states would be specifically prohibited from setting their own standards for the product. For decades, states have set standards to protect consumers when there is no federal standard.

In fact, the first standards were set by California before the federal government took action. H.R. 4626 would revoke states’ long-standing authority to set standards themselves.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MaxPixel.net-Dc-Washington-Capitol-Congress-United-States-2361405.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 18:01:52.254907

Located 75km northeast of Peterhead, the Green Volt project is set to offer 560 MW of clean energy that will supply electricity to the UK energy market.
The Green Volt project reached a significant milestone recently With the required environmental surveys starting in 2020, the Green Volt floating wind project proposed off the Scottish coast has received consent for onshore and offshore operations.
The significant benefits of the Green Volt project can potentially redefine sentiments over wind power in the region.","The realization that the global energy market is currently in a transition away from fossil fuel-based energy production, several nations around the four corners of the globe are turning to the renewable energy sector to develop clean energy projects. The United Kingdom has long been subjected to rainy, windy, and overall cloudy weather that has blanketed the region for generations. Now, a massive floating wind project aims to make use of the UK’s windy and sun-deprived weather.

Scotland is set to become home to one of Europe’s largest floating wind projects

Scotland has long been under the impression that renewable energy generation simply can not work in the region. Solar power, in particular, has been an ambition that is out of reach for the nation. The solution to Scotland’s clean energy problem is simple: wind power.

Wind power generation requires only a strong and consistent breeze to power the massive turbines used by the sector. And the UK has some seriously strong wind currents that are a constant feature in the regions weather report.

Now, the 560 MW Green Volt floating wind project is set to redefine the nation’s clean energy ambitions, while supplying crucial electricity to the oil and gas production sectors in the United Kingdom.

The Green Volt wind project exemplifies the region’s proclivity for wind power

INTOG is a seabed leasing round by Crown Estate Scotland (CES) that aims to foster new and pioneering energy developments in the region. The Green Volt wind project has been proposed as a potential solution to meet the UK’s clean energy ambitions over the coming years. Located 75km northeast of Peterhead, the Green Volt project is set to offer 560 MW of clean energy that will supply electricity to the UK energy market.

The Green Volt project reached a significant milestone recently

With the required environmental surveys starting in 2020, the Green Volt floating wind project proposed off the Scottish coast has received consent for onshore and offshore operations. Having been awarded a Contracts for Difference (CfD) by the UK Government, the Green Volt project is set to become the first commercial-scale floating offshore wind farm in Europe.

The significant benefits of the Green Volt project can potentially redefine sentiments over wind power in the region. The project can offer a range of benefits, including but not limited to:

Saving around 1 million tonnes of CO₂ annually

Adding approximately £2.5 billion Gross Value to the UK economy

Provide over 2,800 direct jobs during construction

The project is targeting first power deliveries in 2029 and could reshape the European energy market due to its substantial energy generation capacity. As the European continent sees a new funding ambition unfolding across the continent to spur investments in wind power, the Green Volt project is set to become the cornerstone of the European clean energy target.

The Green Volt project could possibly cut Scotland’s offshore emissions by 50%, contributing to the UK’s target of 43 to 50GW of offshore wind by 2030. The 35-year operation expectancy of the project means that it will supply the region with clean wind power for many decades to come.

The $7,500 federal tax credit vaporized on Sept. 30, and some automakers tried unsuccessfully to extend that credit in the form of a rebate.

BMW managed to keep that rebate alive. ""As part of our commitment to an electric future and to remain at a competitive price point, we have continued to offer a lease credit of $7,500 for customers leasing one of our battery-electric vehicles through BMW Financial Services,"" spokesman Phil DiIanni said in an email to TopSpeed.

30,000 Charging Stations By 2030?

Still, there's been little news to cheer if you're an EV enthusiast, but California is about to reap a $250 million windfall in planned investment for more than 1,000 charging bays in the Golden State.

The money and the planning come from Ionna, a joint venture and nationwide EV charging network that was announced two years ago by eight major automakers: BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Stellantis and Toyota. Ionna's long-term plan is for ""urban and long-distance EV mobility for all,"" with more than 30,000 ultra-fast and reliable charging points by 2030.

Those plans may have seemed doable a few years ago, but the market has changed.

California Already Has 200,000+ EV Stations

The question is, why is now a good time to announce such a sizable investment in an EV market that is showing few signs of life?

Sure, California is all about zero-emission battery-electrics, but how many more stations are necessary in a state that already has more than 200,000, according to the California Energy Commission? Would it not be smarter to focus on fixing the hundreds of chargers that are inoperable?

Hard To Bank On EV Growth In U.S.

Map of Ionna EV chargers, including some under construction.

Perhaps this $250 million announcement was baked into Ionna's long-term plan since the consortium took shape in July 2023. The EV market looked a whole lot different back then, and Elon Musk hadn't yet infuriated many of his car-buying customers with his DOGE political activities.

Still, automakers from around the world were banking on EV market growth in the U.S. by now, and many of them (Mercedes, for instance) have scaled back their offerings or their plans to launch new EVs, or cut prices.

Could That Money Be Better Spent Elsewhere?

If these eight automakers had told the Ionna leadership that, well, let's not spend all that money in California right now because we could really use it on the bottom line to offset our losses in battery-electric vehicle sales, no one would be surprised.

But it's full steam ahead, with kickoff ceremonies for ""Rechargery"" stations in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster en route to more than 1,000 bays now contracted across California.

4,000 Contracted Sites So Far

Beyond California, Ionna has contracts to build 4,000 charging bays across America, including 1,100 currently in construction or close to opening. So if Ionna only has 4,000 contracts at this point, there's still another 26,000 to be signed if the 2030 goal is to be reached. That seems doubtful.

Where are the Ionna charging stations now, outside California? Vancouver, Washington, has a Rechargery with six NACS connectors and eight CCS ports, and listed amenities are a restaurant, shopping, and restrooms. The station appears to be in a suburban neighborhood with several restaurants in walking distance, along with a martial arts studio nextdoor.

""We believe their performance will improve, even in a smaller market.""

— GM CEO Mary Barra

East-West Corridor Is Emerging...

From there, the farthest Ionna station is 3,200 miles away, in Fort Pierce, Florida, at a Wawa Travel Center, with four NACS and six CCS charging ports. There's also a Dunkin' across the road and a pharmacy nearby.

Yes, the Ionna map across America shows an east-west corridor of stations passing through Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to the Northeast, and much of the eastern seaboard has Ionna coverage as well.

But With Lots Of Gaps

It's great to see amenities at the Ionna Rechargeries, but some of the stations — including those under construction — are separated by more than 250 miles, a distance sure to inflame range anxiety.

And lots of states have no Ionna charging at all: Montanna, Idaho, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia. Road trips there will require other charging providers.

And here's a head scratcher: Michigan doesn't have a single Ionna charging station, nor does there appear to be a plan for one, despite metro Detroit being a hub for EV (and component) development, not to mention the home to two of their automakers, General Motors and Stellantis.

No Ionna Investments In Michigan?

We reached out to Ionna, Stellantis and GM to ask why Ionna's growth plan has skipped over Michigan but haven't heard back yet. In the meantime, GM CEO Mary Barra says electric vehicles “remain our North Star,"" and that the company will continue to invest in new battery chemistries and architectural improvements, much like Ford is doing in hopes of making money on its upcoming $30,000 midsize EV pickup truck.

While praising Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC for connecting with their EVs customers, Barra says in a recent letter to shareholders: ""We believe their performance will improve, even in a smaller market.""

'The Amenities They Crave'

Meanwhile, Ford might not be part of the Ionna consortium (not yet), but starting last week Ford drivers can ""plug and charge"" at Ionna stations nationwide, in addition to using Ford's BlueOval charge network. And Ford's Red Carpet Lease incentives range from $5,500 to $9,000 depending on your preferred version of F-150 Lightning or Mustang Mach-E.

Where does the U.S. EV market go from here? That's hard to tell, but Ionna and its eight member automakers hoping to weather the EV storm are trying to stay focused on the consumers who already own EVs and those considering them.

According to Precedence Research, the global battery market is predicted to increase to $680 billion by 2034. Significant advancements in batteries are driving innovations and growth for applications such as electric vehicles and grid-scale battery storage systems.

The Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing (MCEC) is supporting growth in the battery ecosystem in South Carolina and beyond through the Carolina Institute for Battery Innovation (CIBI). Founded in 2024, the CIBI’s core pillars of research, education, outreach and manufacturing drives technological advancements, cultivates a skilled workforce, and supports South Carolina’s economic development.

While the CIBI is led by Chemical Engineering Professor William Mustain, it is a team effort with 19 faculty members from different departments of the MCEC and University of South Carolina McCausland College of Arts and Sciences. In addition to faculty, the institute includes graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and staff scientists, comprising around 100 people working on batteries every day.

“USC is able to have a breadth of expertise that allows us to work in many different areas,” Mustain says. “We have some faculty doing fundamental research at the nanoscale and others focusing on the application and integration side. This has made USC and the CIBI very attractive to industry, and new partners are constantly contacting us for collaboration.”

Two of the institute’s industry partners are Phenogy and EnerSys. EnerSys, which specializes in the design and manufacture of industrial batteries, is building a lithium-ion battery gigafactory in Greenville, South Carolina and looking to USC to help support its research and development. Phenogy is a Swiss-based sodium-ion battery company that selected Columbia as its U.S. headquarters this past February, with USC playing a big role in their decision.

Phenogy’s North American Director Suzanne Dickerson says that the CIBI will play a critical role since the company plans to produce low-volume products at the institute. It will also help in a meaningful way for Phenogy to build more products in the United States.

“Being able to pilot low-volume production here in the U.S. before we start our own dedicated production will be an important step in the critical path to validating production processes,” Dickerson says. “I believe that testing and deploying commercialized technologies are the spirit of the institute, and it’s a perfect fit for us.”

USC’s battery research began in 1984 with work on silver-zinc systems and has steadily grown since then. The institute’s current work is divided into six core areas.

Advanced materials and chemistry help to create a new understanding of battery charge-discharge process and mechanistic limitations. Meanwhile, activities in battery performance and degradation allow the physical and chemical behavior occurring while operating the cell to be better understood, improving performance and lifetime.

Another core area is simulations as researchers are working on different cell levels, from the electrode (small cells) and pack (collection of cells) levels to the battery management system. Battery safety activities primarily focus on mechanical failure and include puncture and impact experiments as well as shock and vibration testing to determine a battery’s robustness under physical abuse conditions.

There is also a focus on recycling lithium-ion and alkaline batteries, which includes chemical and physical processes to transform used materials back into batteries. Finally, researchers focus on battery integration into power systems for optimizing energy efficiency, reliability and grid-level resiliency.

According to Electrical Engineering Associate Professor Bin Zhang, one of the 19 faculty members of the CIBI, his expertise plays a vital role in battery manufacturing, design and operation.

“In manufacturing, control and optimization can be developed for coating, calendaring, and welding processes. In design, battery high-fidelity models can be used to test design parameters,” Zhang says. “Battery related research in electrical engineering form a solid foundation for safe, intelligent, reliable, and efficient battery manufacturing and management.”

On the manufacturing side, CIBI is building out a state-of-the-art 20,000 square foot facility that is expected to be completed in 2026. It will house two pilot lines that will be able to produce both pouch and cylindrical cells. The CIBI manufacturing equipment is being facilitated by a $10.2 million grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. This new manufacturing capability is one of the core projects of the SC Nexus for Advanced Resilient Energy (SC Nexus), a statewide consortium federally designated as a Regional Technology and Innovation Hub which focuses on the development, testing and deployment of grid electricity technologies.

The pilot lines in CIBI will form the SC Nexus battery manufacturing testbed – a proving ground where industry will come to test and validate materials and methods before transitioning them to full-scale operations. The testbed will be able to serve dozens of industry partners inside and outside of South Carolina every year.

“This will allow us to work with our industry partners through the entire development chain, from fundamental research to manufacturing and application,” Mustain says.

Through existing and future projects, CIBI provides hands-on opportunities for nearly 60 undergraduate and graduates students. Chemical engineering senior Victoria Colón-LaBorde, an undergraduate research assistant in the institute working with Assistant Professor Golareh Jalilvand, says the hands-on experience at CIBI has helped her develop problem solving and critical thinking skills.

“It's different from classroom experiences because we are working on problems that don't have one simple solution, so you have to be creative and sometimes think outside the box,” Colón-LaBorde says. “I have also learned so much about batteries and all different avenues of battery research which I can apply in my everyday life.”

In addition, the student interest in working at the institute has led to an offering of new classes, and the CIBI faculty team is working on creating both an undergraduate minor and graduate certificate in battery science and engineering.

Mustain emphasizes that what has happened with CIBI over the past two years would not have been possible without the support of USC President Michael Amirides, who mentioned the CIBI in his 2025 State of the University address, USC Vice President of Research Julius Fridriksson and MCEC Dean Hossein Haj-Hariri.

Specifically regarding Haj-Hariri, Mustain says, “I could not imagine anyone being more supportive. He is fully engaged and is constantly asking me what he can do to help – whether that is providing resources to move us forward, removing administrative hurdles, or meeting with new partners to help solidify relationships.”

“I am particularly proud that we are charting the course for battery research in the Southeast. This vision was never accidental,” Haj-Hariri says. “It began with my first conversation with Professor Mustain during his recruitment: work together to build a unique capability in batteries and establish our college as the hub for battery innovation—and that is exactly what has materialized. We are making new discoveries, translating them to application, and creating the capable workforce that can continue to lead in this growing field.”",https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/images/news/2025/cibi_research_banner.png,N,,2025-11-24 19:59:12.847738

‘Science drives me’ The love of science showed up early.
She credits advisors and mentors like Frank Hons, Ph.D., a retired soil scientist; Terry Gentry, Ph.D., professor of soil and aquatic microbiology; David Zuberer, Ph.D., professor emeritus in soil microbiology; and Jamie Foster, Ph.D., a forage agronomist, who showed her there were always challenges and questions to answer.
“It is not just about the research,” Lewis said.","For Katie Lewis, Ph.D., every soil sample, every field trial and every long day in the West Texas sun comes down to one thing – helping farmers build a future that lasts.

That commitment runs deep. Lewis grew up on a farm, married a farmer, and now raises her children on the same type of land her research aims to protect.

As a Texas A&M AgriLife Research soil chemistry and fertility scientist and professor in the Texas A&M Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, she works each day to ensure that future generations of Texas farmers can thrive.

Lewis, stationed at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Lubbock, like many Texas farmers, has experienced firsthand the hardships and seasonal ups and downs of the market.

“I want to ensure they can farm the land and do so in an environmentally and economically sustainable way,” Lewis said, noting her children will likely follow in her or her husband’s footsteps.

‘Science drives me’

The love of science showed up early. As a child, Lewis carried around a cigar box with batteries and wires, begging her parents for an at-home science kit. An inspirational teacher who made every lesson feel like a discovery and a standout high school chemistry class only fueled the fire and guided her choice in higher education.

“Her passion and real-world application made me see chemistry as a field full of possibilities,” Lewis said.

Lewis earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and, given her life on the farm, a minor in soil and crop sciences was a natural fit.

“I fell in love with the dynamics of soil – the chemistry and biology involved,” she said. “I love the science. I love answering questions and facing challenges. It is what drives me to get up every morning. It is very personal to me.”

Mentors who shaped the scientist

Two decades ago, Lewis was selling ag products and rodeoing on the weekend – not yet imagining the difference she would make in the world of soil science.

She credits advisors and mentors like Frank Hons, Ph.D., a retired soil scientist; Terry Gentry, Ph.D., professor of soil and aquatic microbiology; David Zuberer, Ph.D., professor emeritus in soil microbiology; and Jamie Foster, Ph.D., a forage agronomist, who showed her there were always challenges and questions to answer.

“They taught me to think outside the box, because by doing so, we can make big impacts,” she said. “And they taught me to think for myself and not be afraid of standing by the science.”

Big impacts, field by field

Now in her 11th year with AgriLife Research, Lewis turns that early curiosity into practical solutions for producers. When she considers where her work is moving the needle for farmers, three themes rise to the top: nutrient management, resilient cropping systems and soil health.

For High Plains cotton, her research is revitalizing soil nutrient management recommendations and demonstrating which nutrients have the greatest impact across the region. This work moves toward her goal to find environmentally and economically sustainable management strategies for farmers and their cropping systems.

One focus is on organic amendments. She is studying the use of manure and the incorporation of organic nutrient sources into production systems.

In cotton, potassium consistently emerges as a difference-maker.

“We can see big returns on our investment for potassium applications, because cotton has a high demand for potassium,” she said. “And nitrogen management strategies are important. So, focusing on what each crop needs as it progresses can save on inputs and help farmers be more productive.”

Running parallel is research on cover crops, which can be a tool to address yield limitations tied to water deficiencies while improving soil structure and protecting sandy soils from wind erosion. Cover crops optimize nitrogen application strategies and extend the farm’s long-term viability.

“We can confidently say they can be successfully used in the High Plains where irrigation is available,” Lewis said. “In dryland systems, a more profitable system would be a rotation of cotton and wheat or cotton and sorghum.”

More recently, Lewis is tackling carbon dynamics in semi-arid environments – work backed by more than $15 million in grant funding over the past few years to address resilient agricultural practices on the High Plains.

Resilience and scaling impact

For Lewis, though, her impact isn’t only at the farm level; it scales through to the next generation of those who “love the science.”

Her graduate training program has graduated 30 master’s students and 19 doctoral students, with six serving as faculty at land-grant institutions.

“It is not just about the research,” Lewis said. “It’s about training the next generation of soil scientists to continue to be curious, think outside the box and find solutions to the challenges that agriculture faces.”",https://media.agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2025/11/DSC_6986.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 17:01:51.707726

Further, CARB stated that it will not require limited assurance for SB 253 data submissions due in 2026 (see FAQ # 20).
Unfortunately, for most companies, the Ninth Circuit ruling and new CARB guidance come late in the compliance planning process and create much uncertainty about next steps.","For companies assessing their compliance obligations under California’s climate disclosure laws, the whirlwind of legal developments, shifting implementation guidance from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), and uncertainty about the laws’ applicability and substantive compliance obligations continues to present challenges.

This week saw a series of developments unfold in rapid succession, creating significant uncertainty for companies potentially subject to these laws (which are explained in our previous posts on October 16, 2023, August 1, 2024, September 5, 2024, December 19, 2024, February 19, 2025, September 26, 2025, and October 15, 2025).

Below is a summary of the key developments from the week:

Ninth Circuit Grants Motion Requesting that SB 261 Be Enjoined Pending Appeal

On November 18, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a two-sentence order granting a motion to enjoin enforcement of SB 261 (“Climate-Related Financial Risk”). See Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America et al. v. California Air Resources Board et al., Case No. 25-5327 (9th Cir.), Doc. 44. The underlying motion had requested that the Ninth Circuit enjoin CARB from applying or taking any action to enforce SB 261 or SB 253 (“Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act”) against the Chamber’s members and members of the co-plaintiff associations pending appeal. The appeal concerns a lower court order denying injunctive relief during the pendency of plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge to SB 253 and 261. Last month, the Ninth Circuit assigned the motion for junction to a merits panel and scheduled argument for January 9, 2026, causing the plaintiff associations to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Supreme Court in light of the upcoming January 1, 2026, compliance deadline for SB 261.

The Ninth Circuit provided no explanation of the decision to grant the plaintiffs’ motion for injunction as to SB 261, but presumably the upcoming compliance deadline was a consideration. In light of this development, the U.S. Chamber and its co-petitioners withdrew their emergency petition filed last week with the U.S. Supreme Court. Oral argument before the Ninth Circuit is still scheduled for January 9, 2026, where the lower court’s denial of the request to preliminarily enjoin SB 253 and 261 will be at issue.

The Ninth Circuit’s order does not address whether the scope of the injunction is limited to the plaintiffs in the litigation or whether SB 261 enforcement is enjoined more broadly. CARB was asked during the public workshop it held on SB 261 and 253 implementation (summarized below) on the same day of the Court’s order whether it would pursue enforcement of SB 261 as to non-parties to the litigation, in light of the Court’s order. A CARB attorney responded during the workshop that the issue is still under review because the order had just been issued.

CARB Holds Public Workshop on SB 253 and 261 Compliance and Implementation

Also on November 18, 2025 (contemporaneous with the Ninth Circuit order issuance), CARB held a public workshop to present new information on compliance deadlines and substantive obligations under SB 253 and 261. In anticipation of the workshop, CARB posted updated SB 253 and 261 guidance to its resources page, including updated FAQs and a final version of the SB 261 Compliance “Checklist.”

Key takeaways from the workshop and the updated guidance documents are as follows:

SB 261 Compliance for “Early-Stage” Analysis. The updated Checklist emphasizes that companies in the early stages of evaluating climate-related risks may begin by disclosing how those risks relate or may be relevant, even if no material risks have been identified or actions taken. CARB “encourages” such companies to include in their disclosures a description of gaps, limitations, and assumptions made as part of their assessment of climate-related issues. CARB’s staff stated during the workshop presentation that they do not expect companies to be developing new data or methods for the first reports due January 1, 2026—rather, staff emphasized a “provide what you have” approach to discharging the reporting obligation.

SB 253 Deadline and Enhanced Enforcement Discretion for Initial Reports. CARB plans to propose an August 10, 2026, deadline for the first reports due under SB 253, covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions (see updated FAQ # 3). CARB also re-enforced the “report what you have” message of its December 2024 enforcement discretion notice but signaled additional leniency—stating in the workshop and its updated FAQs that, if an entity was not collecting data or planning to collect data at the time the enforcement discretion notice was issued, it is not expected to submit Scope 1 and 2 reporting data in 2026. Instead, such entities “should submit a statement on company letterhead to CARB, stating that they did not submit a report, and indicating that in accordance with the Enforcement Notice, the company was not collecting data or planning to collect data at the time the Notice was issued” (see FAQ # 19). Further, CARB stated that it will not require limited assurance for SB 253 data submissions due in 2026 (see FAQ # 20).

Implementation Fees. CARB expects to issue invoices for the implementation fees authorized under both SB 253 and 261 on September 10, 2026, and emphasized that fees will be assessed on an entity-specific basis. Fees will be equal for all reporting entities, and each covered entity in a corporate family will trigger a separate fee obligation. The first phase of CARB regulations—expected to be published late 2025-early 2026, with Board approval and adoption expected in the first quarter of 2026—will largely be focused on the administration of the fee provisions of the laws, in addition to codifying the SB 253 compliance deadline.

Applicability. CARB also provided additional guidance on how companies should evaluate whether SB 253 and 261 apply to them, although ultimately such clarifications will not have legal effect until CARB completes its rulemaking process next year. Nonetheless, CARB specified that:

“Doing business in California” for purposes of SB 253 (and potentially SB 261) will be defined by reference to the “doing business” definition in California Revenue & Tax Code (RTC) § 23101, but only paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) & (2) of that section, meaning that only the in-state sales thresholds would be relevant to determining whether an entity is “doing business,” not the property or payroll thresholds.

Annual revenue will likely be defined by reference to the RTC § 25120(f)(2) “gross receipts” definition (see FAQ # 4). Thus, annual revenue for purposes of SB 253 and 261 applicability would be verifiable in a company’s FTB tax filings (g., Form 100, Schedule F, Line 1a “gross receipts” for corporations, see Workshop Presentation Slide 21).

Parent-Subsidiary Relationship. CARB clarified during the workshop that “parent-subsidiary relationships do not determine which entities are regulated” (Workshop Presentation Slide 26), and, where a parent entity has a subsidiary doing business in California, the parent will not be automatically deemed to be doing business in California—rather, “[i]nclusion criteria should be assessed on an individual company basis,” and both the parent and the subsidiary should “assess their own compliance obligations based on the criteria outlined in the statute” and CARB’s proposed definitions summarized above (FAQs # 12-13).

Unfortunately, for most companies, the Ninth Circuit ruling and new CARB guidance come late in the compliance planning process and create much uncertainty about next steps. There is not a uniform answer as to how to proceed, as each company is differently situated in terms of preparation, corporate structure, and other factors.

The Gerry Lane Cadillac EV inventory includes the Escalade IQ, Vistiq, Lyriq and Optiq. Customers are welcome to test drive them before purchase.

Beyond the EV conversation, Patton said the demand for SUVs remains dominant in the Baton Rouge market. Families appreciate the extra space, while single adults enjoy the sense of safety and protection that they experience in a larger vehicle. Improvements in fuel economy have also spurred more interest, he said.

Patton noted that most new SUV models include multiple cameras, sensors and 360-degree views of the area around the vehicle, making them easier than ever to drive, park and maneuver.

“Everyone is looking for vehicles with convenience and technology,” he said.

The final rule will be effective December 15, 2025, at which point RRC—not EPA—will be the primary Class VI permitting authority in Texas. This shift has significant implications for permitting timelines, litigation risk, and regulatory strategy for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in Texas.

Background: EPA Delegates Class VI Primacy to Texas

On November 12, 2025, EPA announced a final rule approving Texas’s application to administer the Class VI UIC program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Texas is now the sixth state with Class VI primacy, joining Arizona, Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

The RRC has been developing its Class VI program with EPA Region 6 since 2021 and reports that it has already received 18 applications, supported by a dedicated “Special Injection Permits"" unit and a recent $1.93 million EPA grant. In its primacy application, Texas targeted issuance of about 25 Class VI permits within the first two years.

Who Does What Now: RRC, EPA, and TCEQ

Texas Railroad Commission

Recent Texas statutory and regulatory changes—including HB 1284 and amendments to 16 TAC Chapter 5—give the RRC exclusive jurisdiction over onshore and near-offshore injection and geologic storage of CO₂ in Texas, regardless of whether wells are newly drilled or converted from other classes. Under this framework, the RRC issues and enforces Class VI well permits and associated geologic storage facility approvals, manages compliance and enforcement, and retains jurisdiction over Class II EOR injection and related CO₂ storage incidental to EOR.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)

TCEQ continues to handle non-UIC permits, including air permits (NSR/PSD and Title V) for capture, compression, dehydration, and other surface equipment, as well as surface water and wastewater issues, including discharges from capture facilities. TCEQ also manages solid and hazardous waste from capture and processing residuals and oversees broader public participation requirements, which NGOs and community groups are already using as advocacy tools.

EPA

Primacy does not mean EPA disappears. The agency continues to oversee Texas’s UIC program through periodic program reviews and retains authority to withdraw primacy if Texas fails to maintain SDWA-equivalent protections. EPA also holds independent enforcement authority under the SDWA, including emergency powers to address imminent and substantial endangerment, and remains central to federal incentives and approvals—notably the 45Q tax credit requirements for secure geologic storage and DOE/IIJA-funded CCS projects.

Permitting and Regulatory Implications

Timing and Sequencing

The RRC’s primacy application projects a 6-month review to issue a permit to drill or convert, and another 6-month period to authorize injection once all required information is submitted, at least under expected staffing levels. Actual experience will depend on how quickly RRC’s new program moves through its first wave of applications and how contentious those dockets become.

From a practical standpoint, eliminating duplicative EPA permitting should streamline Class VI approvals for Texas projects, especially relative to non-primacy states where EPA backlogs remain significant. However, developers will need to carefully align RRC Class VI timelines with TCEQ air permitting and with financing milestones tied to 45Q and DOE grants.

Early mis-sequencing can push projects out of key tax-credit windows or offtake-start deadlines. With 18 applications already in the queue and more expected, early and complete filings may receive more favorable timing than later, contested applications.

Transition of Existing EPA Applications

Because RRC staff have been reviewing Class VI applications alongside EPA Region 6 since 2021, many pending projects are already well known to the Commission. Developers with EPA-filed applications should expect formal transfer of pending applications and records to the RRC once the rule is effective, along with gap analyses to reconcile EPA application materials with specific Texas requirements under Chapter 5, such as financial assurance, monitoring and reporting provisions, and emergency response planning. There is also potential for “re-opening” of issues if RRC interprets Texas statutes more conservatively than EPA staff did during pre-delegation review. Projects that assumed EPA-centric timelines should revisit their schedules and covenants.

Key Procedural Steps

Several stages of the RRC process may generate disputes or delays. Early on, staff will closely review whether the application fully addresses the area around the wells, nearby faults, and any old or abandoned oil and gas wells that could create pathways for movement. The Commission is also likely to ask for substantial data and modeling on two fronts: (1) the potential for injection-related seismic activity, and (2) how the injected CO₂ will move over time and how the site will be monitored and managed after injection stops.

Public notice and comment procedures will present another flashpoint. For each Class VI permit, the RRC will have to identify which nearby landowners, local governments, and other stakeholders qualify as “affected persons” with the right to request a hearing. The Commission will also need to show that it has provided meaningful notice and an opportunity for communities near proposed storage sites, including environmental justice communities and residents with limited English proficiency to engage. Advocacy groups raised concerns about these issues during the primacy rulemaking, and they are likely to continue pressing them in individual permit proceedings.

Permit conditions themselves may become focal points both for applicants concerned about cost and feasibility, and for opponents focused on protectiveness, particularly regarding monitoring requirements, financial assurance, injectivity limits, and corrective action obligations.

Litigation and Enforcement Risk

The shift to RRC primacy creates new litigation and enforcement dynamics that developers need to navigate carefully. Final RRC decisions on Class VI permits will be subject to administrative contested-case hearings, followed by judicial review in state district court.

Texas statutes generally impose relatively short windows—often in the 30-day range—to seek judicial review after a final order, and courts will review permits on a substantial-evidence standard limited to the administrative record. This means technical teams should assume their reports, responses to comments, and testimony will be scrutinized in litigation, making record-building essential from day one.

EPA retains significant oversight and enforcement leverage even with primacy delegation. Periodic program reviews could lead EPA to require Texas to tighten implementation, potentially affecting existing or pending permits. EPA and DOJ can still bring SDWA enforcement actions where state enforcement is absent or inadequate, especially in cases of alleged endangerment of underground sources of drinking water.

Enforcement exposure will now come from multiple directions simultaneously. The RRC will conduct inspections and issue notices of violation, administrative penalties, and permit modifications, suspension, or revocation. TCEQ will enforce violations related to air, water, and waste at capture and compression facilities. The Texas Attorney General may bring civil actions seeking penalties and injunctive relief, while EPA and DOJ retain authority for SDWA, Clean Air Act, or Clean Water Act enforcement in egregious or multi-state cases.

Well-structured compliance programs, incident response plans, and privilege protocols will be critical to managing this multi-agency risk.

Strategic Considerations and Action Items

For developers, operators, and investors evaluating CCS opportunities in Texas, several practical steps are worth considering now:",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-11/Texas-flag-TX-state-21105887_1.jpg.webp?itok=YPR8IfYx,N,,2025-11-24 17:01:54.738484

What does this mean?

ON Semiconductor has struggled as electric vehicle demand faltered and the power electronics market softened, pressuring its results. But it’s turning the page by ramping up higher-margin products like the analog-mixed-signal Treo platform and expanding its Silicon Carbide operations for data center power needs. That shift was enough for Morgan Stanley to increase ON’s 2025 and 2027 profit forecasts, nudging shares higher and setting a new $56 price goal. Over at Semtech, rapid cloud and AI-fueled growth is boosting its FiberEdge portfolio, with data center revenues set to climb for at least another quarter. Plus, Morgan Stanley expects the possible sale of older Sierra Wireless assets to further lift Semtech’s profitability. The optimism pushed Semtech’s shares up 7.2%, backed by a new $64 target.

Why should I care?

For markets: Data centers deliver fresh momentum.

Data center innovation is becoming the main growth engine for both ON Semiconductor and Semtech, sidestepping recent electric vehicle softness. That pivot gave investors a confidence boost – ON’s shares edged up after the news, while Semtech’s strong rally underlines how data-driven demand is shaping chip sector trends. This renewed focus could mean more stability as other segments wobble.

Overcapacity Ahead

AlixPartners speculates that global production of EV batteries will be roughly three times greater than demand for EVs in 2030. By that time, EV battery production capacity in North America is expected to roughly quadruple.

According to Nikkei Asia, many manufacturers are already scaling back their ambitious battery production plans. Ford, one of the most aggressive investors in U.S. battery manufacturing, is a prime example. The company is building a $5.8 billion facility in Kentucky with its partner SK On, which is expected to employ about 5,500 people by 2030.

Read: Massive US Battery Plant Grinds To A Halt After Trump’s Tariffs

However, the Blue Oval already reduced its planned battery capacity by 35 percent. It also recently halted production of the F-150 Lightning indefinitely due to dwindling demand in North America.

General Motors has also been forced to make changes. It has been confirmed that 1,550 workers at the battery plants it operates alongside LG Energy Solution in Ohio and Tennessee will be sacked due to “slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.”

Nikkei Asia also reports that Panasonic opened a new battery factory in Kansas in July, but has yet to say when it will reach full-scale production. Initially, it was expected to hit this mark by the end of the 2026 fiscal year. However, as a major supplier to Tesla, it has been affected by the fall in demand for EVs as well.

Slowing EV sales in the States have led to the cancellation of some endeavors entirely. T1 Energy was planning to build a battery plant in Georgia, but has since canned the project.

Though the new plan places less emphasis on wind energy than the 2019 master plan it succeeds, the document unveiled Monday continues to urge New Jersey to build renewable generation and slowly phase out fossil plants to meet energy and emissions goals over the coming decades.

“This report is the culmination of our no-regrets strategy to tackling the challenges of energy affordability, supply and demand, and climate change,” Murphy said in a statement. “I am proud of all that we’ve been able to achieve to make our energy sector cleaner and more efficient over the past eight years. This report’s recommendations will help guide energy policy to new heights in the future.”

Governor Murphy’s energy policy scrutinized as his two terms wrap up

Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office on Jan. 20 after two terms as governor, and another Democrat, Mikie Sherrill, is set to succeed him.

The state’s energy master plan is a policy document whose drafting is mandated by law, though it has no force of law on its own. Its recommendations and framework do not bind lawmakers, but legislators have previously advanced bills to enshrine parts of the 2019 plan in law.

The new plan maintains Murphy’s goal of having New Jersey generate 100% of its electricity from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2035.

That includes a planned phase-out of natural gas plants, which accounted for about 48% of the state’s energy generation in 2023. Mirroring some past proposals, the energy master plan calls for the state to bar the creation of new gas plants and allow existing ones to shut down rather than be renewed.

The plan allows natural gas plants using renewable biofuels under some scenarios, and some gas plants would persist through at least 2050.

Republican lawmakers — and even some Democrats — have criticized the administration for shuttering some of the state’s existing fossil fuel plants without replacements on hand. They said natural gas should be a part of New Jersey’s energy mix.

The plan’s call for renewables differs somewhat from the one issued in 2019. Mainly, the more recent plan places less emphasis on wind generation.

Murphy made wind a key pillar of his energy policy, but the projects not killed by economic headwinds are stalled following a federal permitting and leasing freeze instituted by President Donald Trump’s administration.

Eric Miller, executive director of the state’s climate action and green economy office, said the administration wanted to be sure the new master plan “was responding to the world as it is, not as we want it to be.”

The plan urges New Jersey to continue advocacy before PJM Interconnection, which operates the grid that serves New Jersey and 12 other states. Democrats have said delays in PJM’s interconnection queue are to blame for recent electricity price increases.

Those increases are tied to surging demand spurred by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy needs following decades of largely level electricity demand.

The plan says New Jersey could help offset those increases by raising income limits on certain utility assistance programs, raising caps on some existing programs’ awards, and potentially tying electricity prices to the time of day.

The plan says New Jersey could continue to weigh the benefits of levying additional fixed charges based on ratepayers’ income, but stops short of proposing that the state do so.

It also maintains dramatic goals for building electrification. Each of the plan’s scenarios would require full electric heating by 2050 in the residential and commercial sectors, though the plan would allow at least some amount of gas heating.

Likewise, it maintains ambitious goals on vehicle electrification. Under each scenario, New Jersey would maintain an existing policy that seeks to phase out the sale of new gas-burning light-duty cars by 2035.

“We are doing everything within our control to expand state programs. We work closely with the utilities so we can expand their programs so that we can continue to expand our EV incentives, expand EV adoption, and most importantly, enhance a lot of the EV infrastructure development that we’ve already started on,” said Preethy Thangaraj, the climate action office’s deputy director.

Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Jersey, accounting for 35% of state emissions in 2021, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. That level at least doubled emissions from other sources apart from electricity generation, which accounted for 18% of 2021’s emissions.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-92/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3n2a6964-1-1024x6831764015903.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=TsiP6ySJ,N,,2025-11-24 16:02:17.646180

Officials with Amazon state the company has worked with NIPSCO to establish an energy framework that's intended to bring benefits to existing customers and strengthen Indiana’s electric grid.

The energy agreement is said to include:

Amazon will pay all costs associated with serving its new data center campuses. Through NIPSCO’s new subsidiary called GenCo, Amazon will pay for the use of existing NIPSCO infrastructure and fully fund the construction of any new power plants, power lines, and equipment upgrades required for the project.

Projected $1 billion in customer savings. NIPSCO estimates the agreement will save Indiana’s current electric customers approximately $1 billion over the next 15 years.

Increased grid resilience. The project will add up to 3 gigawatts of new power generation, which goes beyond serving Amazon’s needs of 2.4 gigawatts, improving grid reliability for local communities.

Amazon's newly announced investment is in addition to the $11 billion investment announced last year in St. Joseph County.

The new investment will expand Amazon's infrastructure to new sites across the state.

The new data centers will be built to support artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies.

“This is a massive win for Hoosier ratepayers. This agreement will ensure a surplus in new energy development that will deliver real savings to Hoosier ratepayers,” said Indiana Governor Mike Braun. “Amazon’s historic investment shows that Indiana’s business-friendly climate continues to attract world-class employers and drive growth in our state.

Cliff, Ph.D., Executive Officer of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), demanding answers and documents that the Committee previously requested from CARB on California’s refusal to follow the law and implement the Clean Air Act as written by Congress. The Committee also requested transcribed interviews of six individuals if CARB fails to provide the previously requested information by December 5, 2025.

“The Committee’s August 11, 2025, letter requested information and documents from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) about California’s enforcement of state vehicle emission standards that disregard recent Congressional actions to disapprove waivers of federal preemption under the Clean Air Act,” said Chairmen Guthrie, Joyce, and Palmer. “Unfortunately, CARB’s responses to date have been woefully inadequate and do not satisfy the Committee’s important oversight interests in this matter.”

Key excerpt from the letter:

“Clean Air Act section 209(a) preempts states from adopting or attempting to enforce any emissions control standard for new motor vehicles or engines, or any condition precedent to the initial retail sale, registration or inspection of such vehicle or engine. Under section 209(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may waive federal preemption, allowing California to establish state motor vehicle emission standards. However, Congress passed with bipartisan support, and President Trump signed, three resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) disapproving three waivers of preemption that the Biden-Harris Administration previously granted.”

“The Committee requests that these transcribed interviews be completed no later than December 12, 2025.”

Background:

Since President Trump signed the three Congressional Review Act resolutions into law, revoking California’s ability to set state emission standards that mandate the sale of EVs, the state cannot move forward with plans to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.

The Committee’s August 11, 2025, request sought answers about California’s apparent enforcement of the preempted standards and requested copies of related documents, such as internal guidance CARB provided to its staff, communications with other states, internal correspondence between CARB officials and the Governor’s Office and the Office of Attorney General, and other internal documents concerning CARB’s response to the disapproval of the waivers of federal preemption.

Leading the charge at the daylong event was keynote speaker Rory Christian, chair and CEO at the state Public Service Commission, who called on the audience to “defy expectations through aspirations” and realize a system that is equal parts efficient and equitable.

The former engineer encouraged the audience to see beyond the standard binary of how expectations are viewed: realistic or unrealistic.

Christian offered another way of thinking about expectations. Not simply as realistic or unrealistic, but aspirational, finding the worth in actions taken, not solely in outcomes.

“I can think of no better example in modern history that defied expectations through aspirations (than President John F. Kennedy’s decree to put a man on the moon),” Christian said. “When (he) made this announcement in 1962, the American spacecraft program was in a sorry state and the Soviet Union had just put a man on the moon. To any casual observer, describing Kennedy’s expectations as aspirational would be generous at that. But, in July of 1969, the moon landing silenced all the naysayers” he said, chalking the achievement to “preparation, drive and focus” that “tilted expectations from unrealistic to eventually aspirational and, finally, to realistic.” Christian sees the same potential in the energy sector.

He has seen clearly that “customers are less willing to accept the loss of power during a storm, and when it happens, they want to know when they’ll get that power back. Uncertainty is unacceptable.”

The public also has a growing appetite for clean energy, something the energy sector hasn’t always prioritized. For example, the opening of the Ravenswood Generating Station in 1963 was seen as revolutionary, “a time when modernity and pollution were seen as intertwined.” The project would be inconceivable today.

Christian made clear his and the Public Service Commission’s commitment to providing affordable, safe and reliable utility service for New Yorkers, while also seeking ways to innovate. Despite high stakes and formidable obstacles out of their control, such as sweeping federal budget cuts that take aim directly at key initiatives, the Public Service Commission and Department of Public Service have been working to safeguard projects already underway, advancing shovel-ready initiatives as quickly as possible, and supporting the few remaining federal incentives available, such as for nuclear power.

There are also challenges for the commission that remain pertinent, even preceding the Trump administration. “(For) the last twenty years, our efforts to promote energy efficiency have meant little to no load growth. Today, across the state (and country), the need for electricity is growing sharply,” he said. Christian warned that if forecasts become reality, demand for electricity will far outpace supply at unprecedented levels.

Yet, Christian is confident the commission is staying ahead of the curve as best as possible, investing billions in transmission capacity over the past four years, building infrastructure, facilitating interconnection and bracing against headwinds where they come.

“It is my sincere hope that we can all work in partnership to achieve the various goals that the state of New York has, while overcoming this new set of challenges that we all must face,” he told the audience.

Following Christian’s remarks were a series of thematic panels, covering topics such as climate resiliency as well as balancing sustainability and economic growth across the state.

The first panel centered around reimagining New York’s energy infrastructure goals, with panelists proposing initiatives such as natural gas bans, grid modernization and climate-resilient design that can play a critical role in the state’s efforts to meet surging demand for resilience, sustainability and environmental equity.

The second discussion highlighted the economic and labor implications of New York’s ambitious energy agenda, tackling avenues for job creation, including breaking down social stigmas surrounding much-needed trades, and cultivating growth in overlooked regions.

The third panel focused on the work New York has to do to build climate resilience across the state, as climate crises become more frequent and decades-old infrastructure continue to crack under the pressure. They also discussed the importance of cross-agency collaboration, public-private partnerships, educating future policymakers and advocates about sustainability and energy equity, affordability on the consumer’s end, and perspectives on the incoming Mamdani administration’s approach to climate resilience.

Panelists on the event’s final discussion shared pathways toward creating “climate-smart” communities through policy and partnership. Refreshingly, the largest city in the state was not the center of attention in this conversation, as panelists debated the feasibility of New York’s climate regime in advancing environmentally resilient living and not dissuading key industries that allow rural New Yorkers to be able to put food on the table.",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2025/11/24/54938196720_55f95e77c9_k/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 17:01:26.567985

Geopolitical energy shocks raise both geopolitical risk and oil prices.
Quantitatively, geopolitical energy shocks on average raise inflation by up to 0.2%, while macro shocks on average reduce it by 0.1%-0.4%.","The importance of distinguishing between types of geopolitical shocks

Are all geopolitical shocks alike? In a recent working Paper (Pinchetti, 2025), I show that they are not. Chart 1 shows how geopolitical risk and oil prices have moved together – or not – from 1986 to 2022. The blue line tracks the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) by Caldara et Iacoviello (2022),while the red line shows oil prices (West Texas Intermediate index, WTI, deflated by the US consumer price index). Some events, like the Gulf War or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, trigger supply disruptions in energy markets. Others, such as the 9/11 attacks, primarily affect broader macroeconomic sentiment, often leading to falling oil prices. This study introduces a new way to tell different geopolitical shocks apart – by looking at how oil prices and geopolitical risk move together around major events. When both spike, it signals a geopolitical energy shock, typically driven by fears of supply disruptions. But when geopolitical risk rises while oil prices fall, it points to a geopolitical macro shock, reflecting broader concerns about the global economy rather than energy markets.

Chart 1: Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) and oil prices (WTI)

Identifying geopolitical shocks through high-frequency sign restrictions

Geopolitical shocks of different kinds can be identified by looking at comovements of the geopolitical risk index and oil prices around key geopolitical episodes. To do so, I construct a new dataset of three-day “surprise” responses of the geopolitical risk index and oil prices around 31 major geopolitical events since 1986. The idea is to focus on what happens at the geopolitical risk index and oil prices around major geopolitical events. When GPR and oil prices rise together, I interpret the event as a geopolitical energy shock. When GPR rises but oil prices fall, I interpret it as a geopolitical macro shock.

This comovement between oil prices and the geopolitical risk index is measured using a three-day window around key events – a technique inspired by high-frequency methods in monetary policy research. In particular, the paper builds on the approach developed by Jarociński et Karadi (2020), qui utilise des réactions de marché à court terme pour distinguer des chocs qui se superposent. En appliquant ce cadre à des événements géopolitiques, l’étude construit une base de données de « surprises » – des variations soudaines du risque et des prix du pétrole – et l’intègre dans un modèle vectoriel autorégressif (VAR) structurel identifié en imposant des restrictions de signe sur le co-mouvement de l’indice GPR et des prix du pétrole lors des principaux événements géopolitiques dans la série de l’indice GPR (>3 écarts type).

Inflationary or deflationary? It depends on the type of shock

The effects of these shocks on the US economy differ in meaningful ways. As illustrated in Chart 2, while both shock types are contractionary for output, their effects on inflation diverge. Geopolitical energy shocks raise both geopolitical risk and oil prices. They act like adverse supply shocks, increasing production costs and consumer prices. In contrast, geopolitical macro shocks typically raise geopolitical risk but are associated with falling oil prices, reflecting demand-side concerns. Quantitatively, geopolitical energy shocks on average raise inflation by up to 0.2%, while macro shocks on average reduce it by 0.1%-0.4%. This inflationary effect of energy shocks persists for several months and reflects their supply-side nature, similar to conventional oil price shocks.

Chart 2: Macroeconomic effects of GPR macro and energy shocks

Energy intensity explains sectoral differences

In the working paper, I validate this classification using sectoral data on US manufacturing industries. The results confirm that energy-intensive sectors suffer more under geopolitical energy shocks. Their output contracts more sharply, and their prices rise significantly more than those of other sectors. For example, sectors such as basic metals and petroleum products are particularly vulnerable, with output declines reaching -3% and price increases exceeding 1% following energy-related shocks. These sector-level findings reinforce the view that energy channels are the dominant driver of inflationary pressure during major geopolitical episodes.

Conclusion: Two shocks, two paths

Geopolitical shocks do not always have the same kind of macro consequences. Their economic consequences hinge on their underlying nature. Identifying and responding to these differences is essential for effective policymaking – particularly in a world where geopolitical tensions are likely to remain high.",https://www.banque-france.fr/sites/bdf_espaces2/themes/custom/bdf_espaces2/assets/images/default.png,N,,2025-11-24 18:01:47.898619

Yet, Christian is confident the commission is staying ahead of the curve as best as possible, investing billions in transmission capacity over the past four years, building infrastructure, facilitating interconnection and bracing against headwinds where they come.

“It is my sincere hope that we can all work in partnership to achieve the various goals that the state of New York has, while overcoming this new set of challenges that we all must face,” he told the audience.

Following Christian’s remarks were a series of thematic panels, covering topics such as climate resiliency as well as balancing sustainability and economic growth across the state.

The first panel centered around reimagining New York’s energy infrastructure goals, with panelists proposing initiatives such as natural gas bans, grid modernization and climate-resilient design that can play a critical role in the state’s efforts to meet surging demand for resilience, sustainability and environmental equity.

The second discussion highlighted the economic and labor implications of New York’s ambitious energy agenda, tackling avenues for job creation, including breaking down social stigmas surrounding much-needed trades, and cultivating growth in overlooked regions.

The third panel focused on the work New York has to do to build climate resilience across the state, as climate crises become more frequent and decades-old infrastructure continue to crack under the pressure. They also discussed the importance of cross-agency collaboration, public-private partnerships, educating future policymakers and advocates about sustainability and energy equity, affordability on the consumer’s end, and perspectives on the incoming Mamdani administration’s approach to climate resilience.

Panelists on the event’s final discussion shared pathways toward creating “climate-smart” communities through policy and partnership. Refreshingly, the largest city in the state was not the center of attention in this conversation, as panelists debated the feasibility of New York’s climate regime in advancing environmentally resilient living and not dissuading key industries that allow rural New Yorkers to be able to put food on the table.",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2025/11/24/54938196720_55f95e77c9_k/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 16:01:33.364511

Key findings from the IDC InfoBrief, How AIoT Is Reshaping Industrial Efficiency, Security, and Decision-Making, sponsored by SAS, include:

Predictive maintenance dominates current AIoT use. Nearly 71% of organizations use AIoT for predictive maintenance, the most widely adopted use for manufacturing/industrial and energy companies surveyed. IT automation (53%) and supply and logistics (47%) were the next most cited uses for AIoT.

AIoT drives tangible business value. 54% of respondents anticipate major cost savings, 52% predict smarter and faster innovation and 49% expect streamlined operations from their investment in AIoT. Additionally, 63% believe AIoT will boost productivity and competitiveness.

Skills gap emerges as the top challenge. The skills gap is the biggest barrier to AIoT success, outpacing legacy system integration and data quality issues as the most significant roadblock. Other challenges include high implementation costs, business process misalignment and cultural resistance. Addressing these issues is essential to unlocking AIoT’s full potential.

Heavy AIoT users see greater value. Organizations using AIoT heavily are twice as likely to report benefits that significantly exceed expectations as those that only use the technology sparingly. Strikingly, less than 3% say the value of AIoT “did not meet expectations.”

Momentum builds. A full 62% of organizations globally have adopted AIoT, with another 31% planning to do so. Of current adopters, 43% have achieved widespread or fully integrated deployments.

Regional adoption and perceived value vary. The Asia Pacific region leads in moderate adoption of AIoT, while North America shows a strong push for significant growth. And the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region remains optimistic regarding AIoT’s value across all usage levels.

“Our research found that heavy users of AIoT were almost twice as likely to report benefits that significantly exceeded expectations, while less than 3% of industrial executives surveyed said AIoT’s value did not meet expectations,” said Kathy Lange, IDC Research Director, AI Software. “The takeaway is clear: AIoT is fueling innovation, streamlining operations and driving smarter, faster decisions.”

The IDC research is based on a global survey of more than 300 industrial executives in the manufacturing and energy industries.

""This IDC InfoBrief confirms what manufacturing and energy customers are telling us worldwide: AIoT has evolved from a buzzword to a potent technology and business imperative,” said Jason Mann, Vice President of IoT at SAS. “Whether enhancing the predictive maintenance of critical equipment or improving operations across factories and electric grids, AIoT drives major cost savings, quality improvements and efficiency gains.”

The transformation of manufacturing

Manufacturers and industrial companies face countless challenges, including supply chain disruptions, national security concerns and persistent labor shortages. In response, manufacturers are accelerating digital transformation strategies, leveraging technologies like AIoT to modernize operations and address workforce gaps.

Factory automation is one of the most visible outcomes of this transformation, and AIoT is a catalyst driving it forward. Across sectors, manufacturers are using AIoT to automate not just tasks, but decisions – optimizing processes, improving product quality and reducing downtime.

“As this InfoBrief clearly indicates, AIoT drives business value, and the more industrial companies use it, the greater benefits they see,” said Dez Tsai, Global Sr. Director of AI, Data and Vendor Transformation at TD SYNNEX, SAS’ strategic IT distribution partner. “We anticipate the adoption of AIoT solutions will accelerate as companies experience greater efficiency, productivity and cost savings. TD SYNNEX remains committed to supporting SAS Partners and the AIoT customers they serve.”

Energizing the market

For power and energy companies, AIoT offers many benefits. By analyzing data from countless sensors across the grid and in major equipment (including generators, power plants and wind turbines), AIoT can improve grid efficiency by helping operators manage costs, predict demand, optimize operations and enhance sustainability efforts.

And AI technologies give more people within an organization, including those with varying skill levels and job roles, the ability to interact with data. This directly addresses the skills gap found in the research. People working on the plant floor, servicing overhead lines or creating corporate strategy can all make data-driven decisions that leverage IoT and generative, agentic and traditional AI (i.e., machine learning).

Accelerating AIoT innovation

SAS IoT solutions combine AI, machine learning and edge-to-cloud integration, enabling analysis of high-volume, high-velocity data. And joining AI with these IoT solutions extends the value of existing infrastructure investments and digitally transforms the workforce by shifting from manual oversight to intelligent orchestration.

Other organizations benefiting from SAS IoT and streaming analytics for improved asset reliability, enhanced product quality and increased efficiency across connected systems include:

Georgia-Pacific

Jakarta Smart City

Lloyd’s List

Lockheed Martin

Town of Cary (North Carolina)

Volvo Trucks and Mack Trucks

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

The story of the North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency’s disaster response efforts was itself ”a disaster.”

That’s what State Auditor Dave Boliek, a Republican, concluded in a scathing 506-page report released Wednesday, detailing mismanagement that left thousands of Hurricane Matthew and Florence survivors without homes and living in motels for as long as four years.

“The unfortunate truth of this report is the response from North Carolina to Hurricanes Matthew and Florence was a disaster,” Boliek said in a press statement about an agency also known as ReBuild NC. “When government decides to focus on administrative procedures ahead of boots on the ground, hurricane victims get hurt.”

NCORR’s accounting and monitoring was so rife with errors, the state auditor could not determine the full extent of the waste. “​​We really wanted to be able to show a full financial accounting of everything that happened at NCORR,” Boliek said at a press conference. “But when we took a look at the finances, the time, energy and effort would have cost well over seven figures to bring in contractors to reconstruct a true budget. It wasn’t worth the taxpayers’ dollars.”

A legislative oversight committee will discuss the findings on Thursday at 10 a.m. at a meeting in Greenville. It will also be streamed online.

NCORR received $800 million in federal funds and, when that ran out, another $297 million in state appropriations earlier this year to help eastern North Carolinians return home after the historic storms. Hurricane Matthew occurred in October 2016, followed by Hurricane Florence in 2018.

Most of the money was to be used for the Homeowner Recovery Program, which pays for storm survivors’ houses to be repaired or rebuilt.

The auditor’s office made several key findings:

NCORR “had no structured financial roadmap or ongoing budget monitoring,” according to the audit. Nearly $785 million in public funds was disbursed to vendors “without a single, reconciled source of financial truth or robust oversight.”

NCORR did not consistently verify that the contractors performed the work they were paid for. Only one of six program administration contracts include benchmarks for performance.

NCORR spent more than $25.4 million on design and implementation of the Salesforce platform, which tracked the progress and expenditures related to homeowner projects. But incomplete and inconsistent data in the Salesforce system “led to operational challenges and delayed recovery for many families,” the audit said.

Homeowners had to navigate eight protracted steps before contractors hired by the state would rebuild or repair their homes. It took an average of four years for hurricane survivors to return home, far longer than the agency’s goal of 18 months. During that time the state covered the costs of motels and storage, expenses that totaled as much as $2.1 million per month.

The state legislature created NCORR after Hurricane Florence, in response to an earlier iteration of the agency that had also fumbled the recovery program.

However, NCORR mismanaged the program nearly from its inception. ReBuild NC failed to hold many contractors accountable for their work and awarded several lucrative contracts to one, Rescue Construction Solutions, which did not install most of its modular homes on time. Rescue consistently denied any wrongdoing.

At the time, the agency’s director, Laura Hogshead, attributed the delays primarily to the pandemic. Hogshead abruptly left her job a year ago, within days of a particularly combative legislative oversight hearing.

“NCORR spent a lot of time on process when their job should have been swinging hammers,” Boliek told reporters on Wednesday.

NCORR had hired an outside company to manage the Homeowner Recovery Program, according to the audit, for a flat fee of $480 per application per month, until an application was formally deemed ineligible in the system.

That led to applications staying in the system—and generating income for the outside company—longer than necessary. When the contractor was managing the Homeowner Recovery Program, each project cost $41,000 in administrative costs, according to the audit. After NCORR brought the management in-house, the cost decreased to just $4,100 per project.

“NCORR staff reported that many applications could have been determined ineligible almost

immediately, but previous NCORR management instructed staff not to send ineligibility

notifications or close cases,” the audit says. “This lack of timely communication forced families to wait unnecessarily, preventing them from seeking alternative solutions for their housing needs.”

But problems persisted and even worsened after the pandemic. NCORR moved money among programs that short-changed some initiatives or eliminated them altogether, state records show.

“They had a pot of money and they spent it,” Boliek said. “They took the attitude that we’re going to spend it and when we’re out, then the program’s over. They didn’t spend money on a mission-oriented project with measurable incremental goals.”

As of Nov. 14, there were 314 households still waiting for new or repaired homes under the Hurricane Matthew or Florence programs, according to state data. More than 3,900 have been completed.

NCORR is expected to finish all projects and disband by October 2026.

In a written response to the auditor, Pryor Gibson, who replaced Hogshead as NCORR director, did not dispute the findings. He wrote that in partnership with the Office of State Budget and Management, the agency has “significantly improved its financial management systems to ensure the program can complete its work and close out in accordance with statutory timelines.

NCORR continues to implement process improvements with regards to strengthening vendor

management, local governments, and construction vendors.”

The auditor’s report is the latest probe into NCORR, state records show.

NCORR lost track of storm survivors who might have been eligible for uniform relocation assistance, according to a September 2024 monitoring report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Such funds help people who are displaced from homes as the result of federally funded projects, such as residents of public housing communities that were damaged by the hurricanes.

In February 2025, three months after Hogshead’s departure, NCORR officials were discovering a more chaotic financial situation than previously known, according to emails obtained under public records law. In some cases, NCORR had incorrectly spent funds on administration expenses for Hurricane Florence that were “in no way affiliated with Florence,” a state compliance specialist wrote, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Officials were also moving money between classifications and programs to cover an $11 million shortfall to rebuild or repair hurricane-damaged homes.

Other expenses were smaller, but suggest a lack of financial oversight: The office was still paying basic charges for state-issued cell phones for several former employees. Other cell phone expenses were being misclassified.

“If we’re not allocating properly, it would be a finding,” wrote Amanda Stapleton, NCORR chief policy officer, in March 2025. “Unfortunately things weren’t done 100% correctly in the past but, I believe we are still here because we want to do things right and successfully fix what we can. This is a good place to implement a change and fix it going forward.”

Federally funded projects have strict accounting protocols. If grant recipients violate those standards, the federal government can recoup the funds. That happened in August, when the U.S. Treasury requested that NCORR repay the federal government more than $800,000 in pandemic-related housing assistance funds that had been disbursed to ineligible households.

North Carolina had received more than $900 million in federal funds during the pandemic for its Housing Opportunities and Prevention of Evictions (HOPE) program. It was part of a $46 billion congressional appropriation to states, territories and local and tribal governments to financially assist eligible households and landlords with rent, utilities and other expenses incurred as a result of the pandemic. Hogshead was also in charge of the HOPE program.

The Treasury Department found NCORR, using HOPE funds, had erroneously paid more than a dozen landlords, people posing as landlords and members of a suspected fraud operation involving a married couple and a limited liability corporation owned by the wife.

The state disagreed with the Treasury Department’s findings and asserted that the payments were eligible at the time, based on federal guidance. It asked Treasury officials to “recognize the good faith compliance described above and reconsider its recoupment demand.”

NCORR could not be immediately reached about whether the amount has been repaid.",https://cardinalpine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/07/shutterstock_1177328176-jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-24 17:02:13.367239

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are found in thousands of products – from fire-fighting foam to cosmetics, and food packaging to saucepans. In addition to being a considerable environmental concern, PFAS exposure is linked with multiple health risks, including cancer.

As governments and regulators continue to grapple with PFAS regulations, mass litigation and sizeable settlements continue across the US. Meanwhile in Europe, claimants are taking advantage of group litigation developments, and the rise of third party litigation funding to pursue claims against manufacturers of PFAS and PFAS products.

With widespread historical use and a long half-life, PFAS chemicals and their impact on human health and the environment have evolved from a health and environmental concern into a major driver of global litigation and regulatory activity and a significant insurance risk.

Regulatory landscape

PFAS regulation is arguably most advanced within the EU, with the Drinking Water Directive enforcing low maximum concentration limits and other measures, such as mandatory monitoring of food and baby formula, having already been implemented. In August 2025, the European Chemicals Agency published an update to its 2023 proposal to further restrict PFAS. The proposed restrictions could apply to more than 10,000 PFAS across the EU with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) considering a number of regulatory options across different PFAS applications and sectors – from a full PFAS ban to allowing continued use under strict conditions designed to control emissions.

UK REACH requires PFAS manufacturers to understand the hazards associated with PFAS chemicals, and to take steps to minimise risks to human health and the environment. A consultation on a potential restriction on PFAS in fire-fighting foams is currently underway with regulatory tightening likely after the consultation ends in February 2026.

In the US, President Trump had previously vowed to combat the spread of PFAS in the face of mounting litigation and growing concerns over PFAS links to cancer but the Environmental Protection Agency has now pulled back on implementing stricter drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, citing economic concerns. The reversal has alarmed scientists and activists who fear it may lead to regulatory inertia. Nevertheless, many manufacturers, such as 3M, have announced that they will stop manufacturing PFAS, despite the lack of clear regulations or restrictions, citing increased regulatory trends and consumer concerns over PFAS health and environmental impacts.

Litigation trends

Amid the evolving regulatory landscape, PFAS litigation across the globe continues. Manufacturers 3M and DuPont, for instance, have both agreed settlements worth billions to resolve PFAS claims. In June 2023, 3M agreed a settlement of up to US$12.5 billion to resolve claims from a group of US public water systems for PFAS contamination stemming from AFFF firefighting foam. The settlements were reached in the course of the AFFF Multi District Litigation, the most significant aggregation of PFAS claims globally. The AFFF MDL is now considering personal injury claims from plaintiffs including veterans and military families exposed to AFFF. Rumours of a potential settlement of these personal injury claims has seen a surge in filings with 37,446 new claims filed in just one week in September 2025.

Despite a seemingly endless pool of potential plaintiffs (studies suggest that 97 per cent of Americans have PFAS in their blood) there has been some judicial caution in how broadly the class action net is cast. In Ohio, a court rejected a certification of a class of nearly 12 million residents, making it clear that plaintiffs must identify a plausible pathway between a defendant’s products and their illness – a bar that may be more easily met in the context of occupational exposure.

Questions of causation will be a significant hurdle for plaintiffs globally seeking damages arising out of PFAS exposure and the issue is far from settled, despite the extensive PFAS settlements in the US.

US plaintiffs seeking to expand the pool of defendants from PFAS manufacturers to secondary users of PFAS in cosmetics and food packaging are working around the causation issue by basing claims on allegations of fraud or false advertising where companies market products as “all natural” or “non-toxic” despite PFAS content. Such claims avoid the science-intensive burden of proving bodily harm or environmental damage and rely instead on deceptive trade practices laws – a potentially lower bar for plaintiffs to meet.

Outside of the US, EU directives designed to facilitate representative actions have given consumer groups and government entities the standing to bring class actions on behalf of groups of consumers and across multiple member states. Coupled with the growing use of third-party litigation funding in jurisdictions including the Netherlands, Belgium and France (where major PFAS manufacturers operate), this is expected to lead to an increase in large scale PFAS litigation across Europe.

A long-tail, multi-line threat

The PFAS problem presents challenges across multiple insurance lines with claims stretching across time and geography. PFAS contamination may persist for decades after manufacture ceases, raising questions around policy trigger and allocation. One certainty is that the global societal cost of PFAS will be immense, with a report from non-profit Chemsec estimating the annual cost at around US$17.5 trillion, including healthcare and costs of removing PFAS from contaminated soil and water.

The evolving PFAS landscape requires a proactive approach to risk management and underwriting as jurisdictions develop new regulatory standards and the litigation landscape evolves. For claimants, tightening regulation, developing science, class action directives and litigation funding will be powerful drivers of litigation. For defendants, evolving standards mean that compliance today may not insulate them from future claims. Developing testing for PFAS and scientific study may also uncover as yet unknown sources of contamination or damage which will increase liabilities.

PFAS has evolved into a systemic, cross-sectoral risk with implications for litigation, regulation and insurance that will endure for decades. As the “forever chemical” continues to test the boundaries of liability, only those with a forward-looking risk perspective will stay ahead of the liability curve.","https://as-s01-uks-cm-05.azurewebsites.net//media/zggndbj5/life-ring-in-waves.png?width=1200&height630&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-11-24 17:01:48.021142

Amazon plans to invest an additional $15 billion in Northern Indiana to build data center campuses, creating 1,100 new high-skilled jobs and supporting thousands more in the data center supply chain.

The new project will add 2.4 gigawatts of data center capacity in the region.

Energy agreement with NIPSCO will improve local citizen services and is expected to provide approximately $1 billion in cost savings to current Indiana residents and businesses over 15 years.

Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than $31.3 billion in Indiana, contributing more than $29.9 billion to the state's GDP and supporting 24,500 full and part-time jobs, plus 27,500 indirect jobs, across various facilities.

Amazon will bring training and education programs, including data center technician programs, fiber optic fusion splicing workshops, and STEM awareness and learning opportunities for K-12 schools, to local communities.

Today, Amazon announced plans to invest an estimated $15 billion in Northern Indiana to build new data center campuses to support artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing technologies. Generative AI is driving increased demand for advanced cloud infrastructure and compute power, and Amazon’s investment will support the future of AI innovation from new data center campuses in the Hoosier State. This investment is additional to the $11 billion investment announced last year in St. Joseph County and will expand our infrastructure to new sites across Indiana.

This new project, which will add 2.4 gigawatts of data center capacity in the region, builds on AWS’s strong track record of innovation, scale, and engineering excellence—bringing the same advanced infrastructure that powers Project Rainier, the world’s largest AI supercomputer. By designing our own chips, servers, and network architecture, AWS delivers unmatched performance, security, reliability, and efficiency for customers running the world’s most demanding compute workloads. These facilities are purpose-built for scale—optimized for AI, machine learning, and next-generation cloud applications—while maintaining industry-leading standards in energy efficiency and sustainability. Together, our existing and future data center campuses represent the next step in our mission to provide the most advanced, secure, and sustainable cloud infrastructure anywhere in the world.

This landmark investment is expected to create more than 1,100 new high-skilled jobs while supporting thousands of other jobs in the data center supply chain. New high-skilled jobs will range from data center engineers and network specialists, to engineering operations managers, security specialists, and many more technical roles. In addition to these direct positions, this planned investment is expected to support thousands of local electricians, construction workers, and fiber-optic technicians, and other jobs within the local community.

“This is a massive win for Hoosier ratepayers. This agreement will ensure a surplus in new energy development that will deliver real savings to Hoosier ratepayers,” said Indiana Governor Mike Braun. “Amazon’s historic investment shows that Indiana’s business-friendly climate continues to attract world-class employers and drive growth in our state. This project will create more than a thousand jobs while supporting thousands more across the region, further strengthening Indiana’s position in energy dominance and economic leadership.”

“Indiana has long been an important partner for Amazon, and today we are proud to reaffirm our commitment to long-term investment and growth, underscoring our dedication to fueling AI innovation while generating meaningful economic impact throughout the state,"" said David Zapolsky, Amazon's chief global affairs and legal officer. ""By expanding our advanced cloud infrastructure in Indiana, we are investing in Indiana's technological future through job creation, skills training initiatives, and community engagement programs. We're excited to help power the next wave of technological advancement while delivering tangible benefits that will enhance the lives of Indiana residents for years to come.""

Powering Indiana’s future: A partnership that benefits everyone

Amazon’s energy strategy is part of our customer obsession, and that includes the communities where we operate. That’s why Amazon and NIPSCO have established a first-of its kind framework specifically developed with local residents and small businesses in mind, to power Amazon data centers—helping to bring more connectivity, faster speeds, and innovative AI tools locally and across the U.S.—while delivering substantial benefits to existing customers. Through its newly created subsidiary, NIPSCO Generation LLC (GenCo), Amazon will pay fees to use existing power lines and cover the costs for any new power plants, power lines, or equipment needed to serve the data center project—without additional cost to local residents and businesses. This is just one way Amazon is structuring new energy deals to ensure communities aren't impacted.

“This agreement structure with Amazon represents approximately $1 billion in cost savings over 15 years to our existing NIPSCO electric customers while strengthening our regional grid and economic future,” said Vince Parisi, NIPSCO president and chief operating officer. “By structuring this agreement thoughtfully, we're ensuring our current customers are protected, without increasing their rates, while we expand our capacity to meet growing demands. This project isn't just about powering data centers, it's about powering possibilities for our communities through thousands of new jobs, an expanded tax base, and building a skilled workforce in Northern Indiana for long-term growth and prosperity.”

In total, the new project will add up to 3 gigawatts of new capacity, which goes beyond serving only Amazon's needs of 2.4 gigawatts. This additional generation helps to enhance grid reliability for all of NIPSCO's customers, while also adding greater assurance that the grid remains reliable during periods of peak stress, such as hot summer days and cold winter nights. Amazon is committed to building, growing, and investing in Indiana's energy infrastructure for the long-term.

The agreement with NIPSCO represents a win for all stakeholders. For local residents and businesses, it means an estimated $1 billion in cost-savings over the life of the contract without bearing any project risks. And, for the communities in Northwest Indiana, it’s an opportunity to benefit from major economic development opportunities and skills training enabled by Amazon's investment.

“This project will create good-paying jobs for Hoosiers, expand our tax base, and strengthen the economic foundation for communities across the state,” said U.S. Representative Rudy Yakym. “It also positions Indiana at the forefront of America’s next generation of innovation. As our country races to lead in artificial intelligence and advanced computing, investments like this ensure we are building that future here at home and delivering new opportunities for hardworking Hoosier families.”

Supporting education, skills training, and more

As part of today’s announcement, we are also reinforcing the following commitments to Indiana communities:

Support for Indiana community colleges, technical schools, universities, and workforce development organizations to design, develop, and grow training programs and work-based learning opportunities that prepare job seekers for high-demand career pathways in the growing field of data center construction and operations, as well as the broadband industry. This training and support will include facilities and equipment donations to empower hands-on learning; faculty training from industry subject matter experts; and curricular content to link programs of study to industry standards and best practices. This builds on existing partnerships and programs such as:

Amazon Community Workforce Accelerator (CWA): training centers that support careers in cloud computing infrastructure with AWS and our network of contractors, vendors and partners. With cutting edge facilities and a network of training providers—community colleges, universities, school districts, industry training organizations, and AWS itself—CWAhouses a variety of skilled technical trades training programs to prepare the workforce of tomorrow to build, connect, power and operate, and maintain AWS's data centers in this region.

Data Center Operations and Fiber Optic Technician Programs: bringing industry experts and state-of-the-art equipment to local education institutions to train the next generation of Indiana data center operators. Ivy Tech integrated these programs into its curriculum in 2025.

Fiber Optic Fusion Splicing Workshops: two-day certificate courses implemented at local community colleges, technical schools, and universities that train individuals in fusion splicing (the welding together of fiber optical cables) techniques and equipment, then connect these learners to fiber-broadband employers.

Information Infrastructure Workshops for Educators: a one-day workshop to help education and workforce leaders better understand the physical layer of cloud computing and our information economy, and the many different careers that are available.

AWS Information Infrastructure Pre-Apprenticeship: a paid pre-apprenticeship designed for students and job-seekers to prepare for entry into any one of several careers that build, connect, power, and operate the infrastructure of the information economy. Those who successfully complete the program will earn industry-recognized credentials and a guaranteed interview with AWS or one of our contractors. The program launched at Ivy Tech in April and the first class graduated the program in May.

Support for STEM awareness and learning opportunities for K-12 school systems, including:

We Build it Better: a set of industry-designed curricular experiences and resources that engage middle school and older students in a work-like STEM environment stocked with industry-grade tools.

We Will Build it Better: a career awareness program for elementary classrooms to engage students in a work-like STEAM environment, complete with an array of industry-grade hand tools and technology.

Think Big Experiences: an innovative initiative empowering students in technology, programming, and robotics, inspiring young people to pursue careers in technology.

Support for education institutions and independent learners with free, ready-to-learn cloud computing curriculum that works backward from employer demand for specific skills and roles in cloud support, software development, and data integration, among other in-demand cloud computing skills. As of 2024, AWS has helped more than 31 million learners across 200 countries and territories build their cloud skills through free training initiatives.

Support for local partners to implement high-impact programs aimed at fostering the sustained growth and prosperity of the region. As part of our long-term community investment, we will launch the Amazon Community Fund in the communities where we will build and operate. This grant program is aimed at supporting initiatives focused on key themes, including STEM education, sustainability and environment, digital skills, culture and heritage, health, and well-being.

In collaboration with community partners and stakeholders, we will identify opportunities to enhance community infrastructure, revitalize public areas, create new green spaces, promote sustainability and invest in what matters to the local community. By focusing on hyperlocal needs, these investments will strengthen communities and create lasting positive impact, ensuring resources are directed to the projects and programs that matter most to the communities it serves.

Amazon’s ongoing commitment to Indiana

These cloud computing and AI innovation campuses join a growing Amazon operations footprint across the state that now includes 13 fulfillment and sortation centers, 11 delivery stations, and data centers in New Carlisle, Indiana.

Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than $31.3 billion in Indiana, including infrastructure and compensation to employees, and has created more than 24,500 direct jobs across the state. These investments support an additional 27,500 indirect jobs, in fields like construction and professional services, and have contributed more than $29.9 billion to the Indiana GDP, in addition to Amazon’s investments. We have also made significant investments in renewable energy projects, including four solar farms and a wind farm.

We choose locations for our data center campuses that provide robust utility infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and opportunities to support public services through increased tax revenue. Our goal is to create a positive impact across the state of Indiana, and drive increased job creation, educational partnerships, sustainability initiatives, and community reinvestment. We are proud to expand our operations in Indiana to help drive AI innovation and are grateful for the state and local leaders who have partnered with us. We look forward to keeping the state of Indiana at the leading edge of the digital age.

These data centers demand continuous, reliable power.","Facebook parent company Meta Platforms (META) is no longer just a social media giant. These days, it's also looking to become a power player – literally.

Faced with skyrocketing energy demands from artificial intelligence (""AI"") data centers, the $1.5 trillion tech giant is entering the electricity trading business.

The move marks a major shift in how Big Tech sources power. It also highlights the growing tension between digital growth and the physical limits of the U.S. power grid.

While billions of people around the world use AI to write cover letters, create monthly budgets, and teach them Spanish, the exploding demand has shaken up the energy markets, too.

The advanced computing needed to train and operate AI systems consumes massive amounts of electricity. To stay ahead of the curve, Meta is making a bold bet: It will trade electricity to help fund and fast-track new power-plant construction in the U.S.

As Urvi Parekh, Meta's head of global energy, told Bloomberg:

Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that's on the system, it's not happening as quickly as we would like.

Meta's strategy is to sign long-term electricity contracts with power plant developers, often before the plants even exist. These early commitments offer financial security to developers and give Meta the right to resell excess power on wholesale markets. It's a way to manage both supply and risk, providing flexibility if energy needs fall short of projections.

Meta's move comes as the entire tech industry braces for a power crunch. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that U.S. data centers could face a power shortfall of up to 13 gigawatts by 2028 – enough to power more than 10 million U.S. homes for a year.

The root of the problem is scale...

AI models like ChatGPT and Meta's own Llama require huge server farms to function. These data centers demand continuous, reliable power. The buildout of AI infrastructure is outpacing utilities' ability to expand and upgrade the grid, raising concerns about reliability and cost for ordinary consumers. As Ben Hertz-Shargel of energy consultant Wood Mackenzie said:

We're seeing a breakdown between the demand and supply sides of the market... To better orchestrate growth, you need some of the largest buyers of electricity to actively support the buildout of the supply side.

Tech Giants Compete for Power

But Meta isn't alone...

Fellow tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are also exploring power trading as a way to secure clean, reliable energy for their operations. Apple has already received federal approval to trade power, while Microsoft and Meta are in the process of applying.

Each company is experimenting with unique strategies. Microsoft has filed patents for cryogenic systems to cool and power data centers, while Google has launched Project Suncatcher, a moonshot initiative to run AI in space using solar-powered satellite constellations.

Meanwhile, chip-making behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) has teamed up with Starcloud to deploy GPUs in orbit, reducing the strain on Earth's grid. And a few months ago, Nvidia invested in a nuclear fusion startup.

Even newer AI companies like Anthropic are investing billions in U.S.-based infrastructure to compete in this arms race of compute power.

These creative efforts reflect a clear reality: Tech firms need more electricity than the current system can provide. As Dan Stein, CEO of research organization Giving Green, put it, ""Companies just need more electrons than the grid can currently provide.""

For Meta, entering energy markets is both a necessity and a gamble. Power trading offers the ability to hedge risk, but it also comes with volatility and potential losses.

Other industries – like airlines and automakers – have used commodity trading to manage input costs, with mixed results. Ford Motor (F), for instance, famously lost $1 billion on a bad metals trade in the early 2000s.

Still, experts say it makes sense for tech giants to take this step. ""Their input into production is electricity, just like for Coca-Cola (KO), it's cane sugar, corn syrup and aluminum,"" said Mike Kirschner, U.S. managing director of power-modeling firm Habitat Energy.

Meta plans to ease into the business, working with external partners before becoming a full-fledged energy trader. For now, the focus is on two competitive energy markets: PJM Interconnection (covering 13 eastern U.S. states) and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which spans much of the central U.S.

AI's Insatiable Energy Appetite

The urgency behind all of this is driven by AI's ever-growing power needs.

According to the International Energy Agency, energy use from data centers is expected to double by 2030, growing four times faster than electricity demand in other sectors. That's before factoring in experimental projects or off-planet computing.

And while the tech industry promises to build a cleaner energy future, the reality is murkier. Meta's massive data center in Louisiana, for instance, will require at least three new gas-fired plants to support its operations. That raises environmental concerns, especially as these companies pledge to hit net-zero emissions targets.

If AI-driven power demand leads to higher retail electricity prices, increased emissions, or new fossil fuel infrastructure, companies risk damaging their ""social license to operate,"" Stein said.

Meta's power-trading ambitions are part of a broader shift in how tech companies operate. No longer just consumers of energy, they're becoming stakeholders in how it's generated and distributed. This trend could bring new efficiencies and innovations, but it also places more responsibility and scrutiny on Big Tech.

Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear that he's willing to take big risks to prepare for what he calls the ""superintelligence"" era. That vision demands unprecedented infrastructure. Trading power is more than a short-term business tactic... It's a foundational part of Meta's future.

""We all believe fundamentally that there needs to be rebuilding of this muscle of building new power plants and speeding up the process,"" said Parekh.

Whether this strategy pays off will depend on execution, market conditions, and how the public reacts to tech giants shaping the Internet and the entire energy economy.

There were 17 rulemakings with some kind of quantified cost-benefit estimate. The most substantial item was a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule on air cargo screening procedures. Additionally, there was legislative movement on multiple Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval. Across all rulemakings, federal agencies published roughly $925 million in total costs and added 3.1 million paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 73

Final Rules: 71

2025 Total Pages: 52,725

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$73.2 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$627.8 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week in terms of measurable economic effects was the DHS rule on “Enhanced Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS).” Specifically, the rule makes changes to the:

Regulations pertaining to the Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) program to require the transmission of additional data elements. The ACAS program enhances the security of flights carrying cargo into the United States by requiring the transmission of certain air cargo data and performing targeted risk assessments based on the transmitted data prior to an aircraft’s departure for the United States.

The agency estimates that these additional reporting requirements will result in roughly 3.1 million hours of paperwork each year. Over a 10-year period, DHS estimates that affected entities will bear $877 million in total costs to update their systems to come into compliance.

The other consequential rulemaking of the week was the proposed rule jointly released by the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers that would establish the “Updated Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’ [WOTUS].” The American Action Forum (AAF) provided some commentary on the proposal’s place in the long and winding history of all things WOTUS here. The rulemaking does not currently include any quantified costs or savings estimates, but given the subject matter it covers, it represents one of the more significant regulatory developments thus far into the second Trump term.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

Congress also returned some of its attention toward regulatory policy issues with a handful of votes on some CRA resolutions. The House passed a pair of resolutions (H.J. Res 130 and 131) that seek to repeal certain Biden-era Department of Interior (DOI) land use determinations. AAF has previously discussed how such DOI determinations fall under the auspices of the CRA here. The Senate also voted to advance H.J. Res 130, sending it now to the White House for President Trump’s expected signature.

The AAF CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 69 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

The disbursements support a wide range of initiatives, including public infrastructure, education, emergency services, conservation and reclamation projects, and historic preservation. This year’s total represents the fifth-largest disbursement since 1982.

The Donald J. Trump administration has focused on combating inflation and reducing energy costs. These lower prices have helped keep more money in the pockets of American consumers while still providing critical funding to states, tribes and federal programs through ONRR’s disbursements. This year’s disbursements decreased from the previous year largely due to the drop in commodity prices.

ONRR’s disbursements were aided by the Trump administration’s priorities under Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy, which directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers and encourage responsible energy development on public lands. Additionally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which reduced the cost of doing business on public lands, making oil and gas development more economically attractive to industry, spurred domestic energy production while lowering commodity prices.

Fiscal year 2025 Disbursement Highlights:

$5.01 billion to the U.S. Treasury

$4.07 billion to 34 states

$2.98 billion to the Reclamation Fund

$1.05 billion to the Land and Water Conservation Fund

$1.00 billion to Tribes and individual Indian mineral owners

$350 million to federal agencies

$150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund

The $4.07 billion in state disbursements reflects revenue from mineral and energy production on federal lands within the states’ borders and offshore tracts in federal waters adjacent to states’ shores.

The states receiving the highest disbursements based on those activities are:

New Mexico $2.76 billion Wyoming $544.87 million Louisiana $162.42 million North Dakota $114.95 million Texas $99.83 million Colorado $90.77 million Utah $81.72 million Mississippi $52.34 million Alabama $51.73 million California $39.12 million Alaska $27.33 million Montana $27.02 million

The revenue disbursed to 33 federally recognized tribes and approximately 31,000 individual Indian mineral owners represent 100% of the revenues received for energy and mineral production activities on Indian lands. Tribes use these revenues to develop infrastructure, provide health care and education, and support other critical community development programs, such as senior centers, public safety projects and youth initiatives.

Since 1982, the Department has disbursed over $402 billion in mineral leasing revenues. ONRR is responsible for the collection, accounting for, analysis, audit and disbursement of these revenues and makes most of these disbursements monthly from the royalties, rents, and bonuses it collects from energy and mineral companies operating on federal lands and waters.

Fiscal year 2025 disbursement data is available on the Natural Resources Revenue Data portal.

Negotiations are moving forward on the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2026, with lawmakers saying they are close to settling on a final text. The House and Senate versions of the bill each include a variety of research policy proposals that may make it into the final bill. Among the most controversial is the SAFE Research Act included in the House bill, which would place sweeping limits on partnerships involving researchers affiliated with “hostile” entities. The American Council on Education published a letter last week urging Congress to reject the act, calling it “problematically broad” and either duplicative of or in conflict with existing research security provisions. The bill’s requirements would “end all engagement with universities in countries such as China and would have a chilling effect on any desire among researchers to work with Chinese partners or Chinese graduate students,” ACE states.

Another controversial item is the House’s interest in adding a moratorium on state AI regulation to the NDAA. The idea was originally included in the reconciliation megabill that Republicans passed in July, but was overwhelmingly voted down before the bill’s final passage. President Donald Trump suggested last week that Congress use the NDAA or a separate bill to set “one federal standard instead of a patchwork of 50 state regulatory regimes,” and media reports suggest the president has drafted an executive order to block states from enforcing AI regulations.

The Senate version of the NDAA includes a provision that would prohibit modification to DOD’s indirect cost rates without input from the extramural research community. The text adds that any changes must reduce the indirect cost rate for all DOD-funded universities and nonprofits from fiscal year 2025 rates and allow “adequate transition time” before going into effect.

NIH halts SBIR continuing awards, solicitations

The National Institutes of Health announced last week that it will not issue any new Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) awards or offer continuation awards to existing projects. The agency said its decision stemmed from the Oct. 1 lapse in legislative authority for the two small business technology maturation programs. Other agencies with SBIR and STTR programs — such as the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation — have not made similar announcements, but congressional staff told FYI in October that agencies can only fund current awards during the lapse in authorization, not issue new SBIR/STTR solicitations or make new awards. House Science Committee Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) said her committee and the House and Senate small business committees are continuing negotiations on the reauthorization. Lofgren called on the Senate to pass the one-year extension that passed earlier in the House. Senate Republicans have opposed the extension, including Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), who insisted on the inclusion of several program reforms to “root out waste.” Ernst is reportedly trying to get her version of the reauthorization added to the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act.

US-China Commission issues quantum, export control recommendations

Congress should establish a “Quantum First” national goal focused on achieving a quantum computational advantage in cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science by 2030, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s annual report to Congress. This effort would involve providing “significant funding” for U.S. quantum development and quantum workforce development initiatives, prioritizing modernization of enabling infrastructure, and establishing a Quantum Software Engineering Institute modeled after the National Science Foundation’s National AI Research Institutes. The annual report also recommends that Congress strengthen export controls in “fast-moving technology sectors, such as leading-edge semiconductors” with AI applications, and to address challenges from China’s “systematic and persistent evasion” of such controls, including by establishing a “consolidated economic statecraft entity” with export control and sanction authorities.

The commission also issued a separate report last week focused on competition between the U.S. and China in quantum. The report said that the U.S. “still leads the world in most quantum research,” but that China leads in quantum communications and is “aggressively pursuing cryptographically relevant quantum computing.”

Now, a shift is underway. Across the U.S., states are stepping into the regulatory spotlight, working with federal agencies to accelerate permitting and oversight.

Federal oversight was designed for a slower market, one focused on environmental protection, not rapid energy transformation. In 2010, the EPA issued the Class VI well rule(link is external) to regulate underground CO₂ storage and safeguard drinking water, not accelerate large-scale commercial CCS deployment. Today, the landscape has expanded. As CCS projects move forward globally and domestic demand grows, more states are pursuing “primacy” — EPA approval to issue and enforce their own permits for Class VI wells.

The result? A hybrid governance model. State regulators bring regional expertise; federal agencies maintain national consistency. Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) frameworks are also part of that evolution, ensuring captured carbon is permanently stored and verifiable under standardized methods.

With six states now approved for Class VI primacy(link is external) — Texas, Arizona, and West Virginia received approval this year — and more than 40 MRV plans approved nationwide(link is external), most in the past two years, oversight is catching up to ambition. Together, these milestones are helping convert policy frameworks into actionable projects.

The stakes are rising fast. Data centers, manufacturing onshoring, and electrification are reshaping energy demand and creating the conditions for CCS to play a larger role.

“Customers like hyperscalers are investing in natural gas-fueled combined-cycle plants to ensure reliability, while at the same time creating a path to carbon neutrality,” says Mike Schuster, Director of Emerging Technologies, Mitsubishi Power. “Carbon capture extends the value of those assets, providing a practical way to further reduce emissions while maintaining dependable power.”

CCS allows utilities to meet today’s reliability needs while building toward the cleaner future that hyperscalers and others increasingly demand. As more states gain Class VI primacy and more projects secure MRV approval, the pieces are falling into place. Regulatory support, corporate demand, and proven technology are converging, setting the stage for CCS to scale in the U.S.

State Policy Is Accelerating Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

State authorities are responding to the shift by pushing for a greater role. Class VI primacy gives them the authority to oversee underground storage directly, streamlining reviews and tailoring oversight to regional conditions. But getting that authority isn’t fast. The EPA’s primacy approval process is slow and opaque, often taking years to complete(link is external) due to national-level review and staffing demands.

Once granted, though, state primacy changes the game. It can dramatically cut permit approval times; in Wyoming, for example, it can take less than a year(link is external). By drawing on states’ deep knowledge of regional formations and existing oil and gas activity, local regulators can evaluate injection zones and monitor plans with local data, aligning oversight more closely with on-the-ground realities.

“With primacy, states can move at their own pace, and that pace is often faster,” says Schuster. “They can staff up and set priorities. That’s how you turn policies into progress.”

Primacy determines where and how carbon can be stored. MRV plans determine how that storage is verified and valued. These plans ensure that the CO₂ injected underground is measured, reported, and permanently stored in accordance with federal standards(link is external). For developers, an approved CCS MRV plan unlocks eligibility for 45Q tax credits — federal incentives that reward each metric ton of CO₂ securely stored — and access to verified carbon markets, providing the financial certainty that investors need. For regulators, MRV plans deliver transparency and accountability, ensuring projects deliver measurable benefits.

Together, Class VI primacy and MRV oversight connect the technical and financial sides of CCS, transforming policy frameworks into infrastructure.

Carbon Capture Technology Is Ready

In the U.S. power sector, the challenge isn’t technology. It is execution. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has deployed CCS at commercial scale for years, and the technology is mature and proven. Mitsubishi Power and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries apply this expertise regionally, helping utilities and developers advance gas turbine plus CCS solutions across North America.

The Broadwing Energy project(link is external) in Decatur, Illinois — the first-ever corporate offtake agreement for a CCS-enabled gas plant — is a key test case. Announced in October, it will pair Mitsubishi Power’s M501JAC gas turbine with CCS to capture and permanently store about 90% of its CO₂ emissions using Archer Daniels Midland’s adjacent Class VI wells. Google(link is external) has agreed to offtake some of the power generated by the project, providing financial backing to build and connect this new, clean baseload power source to the regional grid.

While some projects have proven successful, the economics of CCS remain challenging. The projects are capital-intensive — demanding significant upfront investment in equipment, infrastructure, and labor. Coupled with EPC bottlenecks, labor shortages, and rising construction costs, these projects are difficult to get off the ground.

Unlike solar or wind, CCS doesn’t benefit from small-scale applications that drive down costs through widespread adoption. Each project is a bespoke, large-scale infrastructure build that depends on regional geology, permitting, and industrial partners. Cost reductions will come instead from replicable designs and shared infrastructure, reducing capital expenditure and risk.

Over time, these efficiencies could make CCS more affordable, but today the technology’s economics hinge on policy support, investor confidence, and the successful delivery of more full-scale projects.

Local Leadership Is Defining U.S. Energy Competitiveness

State oversight of CCS projects works alongside federal authority, creating a clearer path from demonstration to deployment.

International models offer some lessons. For instance, the UK has moved quickly with government-backed CCS clusters on Merseyside and Teesside, integrating transport and storage. Supported by more than $26 billion in public funding commitments(link is external) over 25 years, these clusters exemplify how centralized planning and government partnership can accelerate deployment and create thousands of jobs.

In contrast, U.S. policy relies more heavily on tax incentives like 45Q. The credit has energized the U.S. carbon management market, but in the absence of coordinated infrastructure investment, many projects remain isolated efforts rather than components of an integrated national system for CO₂ transport and storage.

Continued state-led efforts can accelerate commercialization and build confidence across geographies, but states can’t do it alone. Scaling CCS will require coordination between regulators, utilities, developers, and communities, supported by state-federal partnerships that build trust, reduce risks, and create momentum.

What’s Next for Carbon Capture and Storage?

State oversight is expanding, demand is rising, and technology is ready.

As part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Power is partnering with energy producers, regulators, and developers to turn regional CCS policy momentum into real-world carbon capture projects in the U.S. and across North America. What happens next depends on public and private-sector leadership. States that build permitting capacity and expertise today will attract early CCS investment and the next wave of infrastructure funding.

The global picture reinforces that urgency. The IEA reports that projects under construction could nearly double today’s carbon capture capacity(link is external), a clear sign that the industry is shifting from planning to execution.

Carbon capture won’t be unlocked by one state or one piece of storage legislation. But the rise of state-led oversight signals practical collaboration between regulators and industry. More states(link is external) are applying for Class VI primacy, and more are expected to seek EPA carbon capture approval and develop MRV frameworks.

For utilities, capture-readiness for new gas builds and retrofits is no longer optional. Waiting means falling behind. For policymakers, primacy must be paired with investment, or it risks becoming a bottleneck rather than a catalyst.

""By investing in air quality monitors and sensors, setting stricter standards, and updating our forecasts, we’re doubling down on our commitment to improving air quality.""
MassDEP monitors air quality at 26 monitoring stations across the state, many of which have been strategically located in areas with higher pollution levels, asthma rates, and other risk factors.
A total of 370 air quality sensors is available for municipalities, Tribes, nonprofit organizations and community-based organizations.
Air quality forecasts are also available by calling the MassDEP Air Quality Hotline at 1-800-882-1497.","BOSTON — Today, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) announced the installation of two new air monitoring stations in Framingham and Saugus. These stations will identify and measure pollution levels from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon. This is part of MassDEP’s broader, ongoing initiative to combat pollution and improve air quality across the state.

""Cleaner air means healthier communities and improved quality of life for everyone in the Commonwealth,"" said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. ""By investing in air quality monitors and sensors, setting stricter standards, and updating our forecasts, we’re doubling down on our commitment to improving air quality.""

MassDEP monitors air quality at 26 monitoring stations across the state, many of which have been strategically located in areas with higher pollution levels, asthma rates, and other risk factors. The agency provides daily air quality forecasts year-round for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and, during the warmer summer months, for ozone. When pollution levels are forecast to exceed health-based standards, MassDEP issues air quality advisories. This past summer, MassDEP recorded six days with unhealthy ozone levels — four in June and two in August. Additionally, there were four days this year with unhealthy fine particulate levels, caused mostly by smoke from Canadian wildfires moving into Massachusetts.

The data collected by air monitors and sensors help inform regulatory updates. For example, in September 2025, MassDEP adopted a stricter standard for particulate pollution — often referred to as soot. This change tracks both data and scientific developments further demonstrating the harmful effects of fine particulate on public health, the environment, and the climate.

2025 Air Sensor Grants

MassDEP announced a new round of its Air Sensor Grant program in October 2025. A total of 370 air quality sensors is available for municipalities, Tribes, nonprofit organizations and community-based organizations. MassDEP will award up to five sensors to each grantee on a first-come, first-served basis until all sensors have been allocated.

The sensors measure fine particulate matter in the ambient air, and all data collected are publicly accessible in real time through EPA’s Fire and Smoke Map and the PurpleAir website.

Learn more about the program and apply here: MassDEP Air Sensor Grant.

To improve air quality forecasts available to the public, MassDEP has updated the maps used by the AirNow and EnviroFlash systems. Air quality forecast regions have been better aligned with National Weather Service public forecast zones and have been given updated names, as depicted below.

Routine users of AirNow.gov will notice a change to most region names and AirNow app users may need to reset their saved Places.

EnviroFlash subscribers have been transitioned to the new forecast regions and were notified about the update through EnviroFlash. MassDEP recommends that all EnviroFlash subscribers review their account information to confirm their desired settings and chosen location.

MassDEP encourages Massachusetts residents who want up-to-date air quality forecasts to explore the many options available by visiting MassAir Online or AirNow.gov, downloading the AirNow app on their mobile devices, or signing up for EnviroFlash air quality notifications. Air quality forecasts are also available by calling the MassDEP Air Quality Hotline at 1-800-882-1497.

MassDEP provides daily air quality forecasts for fine particle pollution year-round and for ozone pollution during the summer ozone monitoring season through its MassAir Online website as well as through the AirNow website and app, and the EnviroFlash notification system.

The new round follows an earlier $700 million Series C financing round completed by X-energy earlier this year, led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, alongside an agreement with Amazon to bring more than 5 GW of projects online across the U.S. by 2039.

Kam Ghaffarian, Ph.D., Founder and Executive Chairman of X-energy, said:

“When I founded X-energy, I envisioned a company that could redefine how to make advanced nuclear energy accessible, affordable, and essential to an energy abundant future. With the support of our investors, both new and existing, we are closer to realizing that vision.”

Founded in 2009, Rockville, Maryland-based X-Energy is a developer of nuclear reactor and fuel technology. The company’s TRISO-X fuel seals uranium particles in a protective coating, which can withstand high temperatures without melting, making it highly resistant to fuel failure and release of radioactive materials, eliminating the need for massive containment facilities. The company’s SMR reactor, Xe-100 is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor operates at temperatures higher than 750°C, and contains more than 200,000 TRISO-X-based fuel pebbles, which are gravity-fed in continuous rotation through the core, allowing the reactor to run without fuel interruption for 60 years. Helium is circulated through the core, absorbing immense heat, and is used to boil water into steam to turn a turbine for the production of carbon-free energy.

The company said that the new financing comes as it has already built an orderbook of more than 11 GW, representing approximately 144 advanced small modular reactors.

Miller emphasized that Texas stands apart from states that burden success and chase away opportunity.

“In Texas, we don’t punish success, we celebrate it,” Miller said. “We don’t look down on job creators or investors; we thank them for fueling prosperity. While other states pile on taxes and red tape, Texas stands firm on freedom, opportunity, and common sense. We believe in keeping government limited and money in the pockets of the hard-working folks who earned it.”

As Commissioner of Agriculture, Miller highlighted Texas’ central role in the markets these exchanges serve every day.

), approved 25-18, emphasizes that NEPA is “procedural” and does not mandate a particular result when agencies consider project environmental impacts.
“Project delays caused by prolonged NEPA reviews, permitting, and litigation increase costs and harm the construction workforce by delaying job creation, disrupting hiring and reducing economic activity,” he wrote.
But fully funding and staffing permitting agencies is also key to progress approvals, especially as increased energy demand presses for more projects to provide needed infrastructure.
“Durable, bipartisan permitting reforms that provide project certainty and speed up energy infrastructure build-out will help keep the lights on and reduce electricity costs,” he said.","Legislation aimed to hasten federal permitting for projects is advancing through Congress as the House Natural Resources Committee voted Nov. 20 to forward an amended version of the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED Act, for a full vote. But even with some bipartisan support for permit reform, opponents say the measure goes too far to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act by reducing transparency and limiting the ability of those impacted by a project to provide input or challenge it.

The bill brought by committee Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), approved 25-18, emphasizes that NEPA is “procedural” and does not mandate a particular result when agencies consider project environmental impacts. During the committee markup hearing, he said the legislation is “project-neutral” and “would tackle a number of problems at the heart of NEPA dysfunction that is present today.”

The SPEED Act would codify the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year in the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition case, in which justices unanimously ruled against environmental advocates who argued the proposed $1.4-billion Uinta Basin Railway in Utah would have detrimental impacts on communities in Louisiana near where oil transported on the railroad would be refined. The legislation states that agencies performing NEPA reviews may only consider “those effects that share a reasonably close causal relationship to, and are proximately caused by, the immediate project or action under consideration.”

The bill would place additional limits on what agencies can consider in their environmental reviews, directing them to rely more on past assessments for similar projects. It would also remove a requirement that a project receiving federal funding—including a grant, loan, loan guarantee or other assistance—would mandate an environmental review.

Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), ranking committee member, questioned how many projects might be waived from requiring environmental review as a result, pointing to U.S. Dept. of Transportation-funded highway projects as an example. The bill would have “wide-ranging and detrimental ripple effects,” he said.

The SPEED Act would also set deadlines for agencies performing NEPA reviews to complete various pieces of the process, direct any cooperating ones to carry out assessments concurrently and prevent them from rescinding previously issued permits.

The bill would also limit challenges to permits and projects following reviews. Opponents would have just 150 days after a permitting approval to file a legal challenge. A courts hearing a case would also have limits, required to “afford substantial deference to the agency” and prevented from “subsitit[ing] its judgment for that of the agency regarding the environmental effects.”

Bipartisan Interest, But Questions Emerge

Republicans have sought to promote the SPEED Act as bipartisan, and committee Democrats expressed a desire to implement permit reform. Seven have signed on to co-sponsor the SPEED Act but only two voted to advance the bill in its current form, with others criticizing its far-ranging potential impacts.

“In our meetings, we heard a real hunger for bipartisan permitting reform. This bill is not it,” Huffman said. “This bill is so extreme that there’s simply nothing left, in a meaningful way, of NEPA if this were to become law.”

The bill has generally received a favorable response from the construction industry. In a letter to lawmakers in September, Alex Etchen of the Associated General Contractors of America highlighted the industry’s need to clarify and streamline various aspects of NEPA.

“Project delays caused by prolonged NEPA reviews, permitting, and litigation increase costs and harm the construction workforce by delaying job creation, disrupting hiring and reducing economic activity,” he wrote. “The delays increase labor and material costs, forcing contractors to reprice projects and potentially leading to cost overruns.”

Bill opponents raised concerns that Trump administration actions have slowed project approvals. The White House has moved to claw back billions of dollars in project funding since Donald Trump took office in January, and to fire thousands of federal workers—potentially leaving permitting agencies under-resourced to conduct efficient and thorough reviews.

“Adequate staffing and resources delivered improvements in permitting timelines last year, and yet this bill does nothing to stop the indiscriminate firings of career civil servants or disregard for congressional direction on funding,” Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement.

Ray Long, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement that the group applauds lawmakers for advancing the SPEED Act, calling for project-neutral permitting and removal of roadblocks to fully permitted projects. But fully funding and staffing permitting agencies is also key to progress approvals, especially as increased energy demand presses for more projects to provide needed infrastructure.

“Durable, bipartisan permitting reforms that provide project certainty and speed up energy infrastructure build-out will help keep the lights on and reduce electricity costs,” he said. “With less than four years to add the equivalent of 15 New York Citys worth of electricity to the grid, it is critical that energy infrastructure projects can move forward quickly.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/11/24/Rep_Westerman_ENRweb.jpg?height=635&t=1764006601&width=1200,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:40.863647

WASHINGTON – The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management today announced a Proposed Notice of Sale for the second offshore oil and gas lease sale under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The proposed lease sale, known as Big Beautiful Gulf, or BBG2, is scheduled to take place on March 11, 2026.

This sale is the second of thirty Gulf of America oil and gas lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. By committing to a predictable sale schedule, the Department is delivering on President Trump’s promise to expand American energy production and strengthen U.S. energy dominance.

“Lease Sale BBG2 marks another major milestone in advancing a robust and forward-looking offshore oil and gas program in the Gulf of America,” said BOEM Acting Director Matt Giacona. “Building on the momentum of BBG1, this proposed sale reinforces BOEM’s commitment to restoring certainty and long-term investment in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. By offering leases under a competitive 12.5% royalty rate, BBG2 sends a clear signal that the era of regulatory uncertainty is behind us, and a new phase of responsible energy leadership has begun.”

Lease Sale BBG2 proposes to offer approximately 15,000 unleased blocks covering about 80 million acres on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of America. The blocks, located 3 to 231 miles offshore, span water depths from 9 feet to more than 11,100 feet.

The Gulf of America Outer Continental Shelf spans approximately 160 million acres and is estimated to contain 29.59 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and 54.84 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Certain areas will be excluded from the sale, including blocks subject to the September 8, 2020, presidential withdrawal; blocks adjacent to or beyond the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone in the Eastern Gap; and blocks within the boundaries of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary.

Economic & Strategic Benefits

Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas activities generate billions of dollars from lease sales, rental fees and royalties. The funds are distributed to the U.S. Treasury, as well as states through several different revenue sharing programs that fund coastal restoration and hurricane protection projects. The largest portion goes to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, which benefits all U.S. citizens through funding of daily operations of the federal government. Offshore development fuels state and federal revenues, helping fund infrastructure, education and public services.

Energy independence is a cornerstone of U.S. economic strength, national security and global stability, boosting American energy dominance and reducing reliance on unstable foreign producers. By continuing to expand offshore capabilities, the United States ensures affordable energy for consumers, strengthens domestic industry and reinforces its role as an energy superpower.

Next Steps

The Proposed Notice of Sale will be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 20, 2025, initiating a 60-day comment period for affected state governors and local governments. Following the review of governor input, BOEM will publish a final notice of sale in the Federal Register at least 30 days prior to the scheduled lease sale date on March 11, 2026. More information, including the PNOS package and a detailed map of the proposed lease sale area, is available on BOEM’s website.

“It’s hard to go into an EV and then back to a (gas-powered) vehicle,"" says Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, posing for a portrait outside of AJC offices on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025. (Natrice Miller/AJC)

RJ Scaringe didn’t build Rivian to make just 50,000 electric vehicles per year.

It’s a company designed to build many times more, the CEO of the upstart EV maker told the editorial board of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week. To get there, Rivian is banking on its newest vehicle, the R2, a two-row crossover, to be a big hit.

Initial manufacturing of the R2 will start in Illinois, but Scaringe said production will expand to its future factory an hour east of Atlanta when it opens, albeit years later than initially expected, in 2028. Future models, including the smaller R3 and R3X, are expected to follow.

“The more people that experience an EV, it’s like a one-way door,” Scaringe said. “It’s hard to go into an EV and then back to a (gas-powered) vehicle.”

He said Rivian will start customer deliveries of R2 early next year, and soon start vertical construction of the Georgia plant after a ceremonial groundbreaking in September. In a wide-ranging interview with the AJC, Scaringe went into detail about the company’s future, why Georgia is crucial to that success and the future of the auto industry.

Scaringe likes to say that software is as important to modern cars as the nuts and bolts of assembly.

Rivian is designed to do both. That strategy entranced investors while creating its own challenges and setbacks when the pandemic struck, but Scaringe argues it’s a framework made to support more than just a niche automaker.

The need to ramp up production is why Georgia is such a critical cog in Rivian’s machine aimed at rivaling Tesla as a leader of America’s new school of automaking.

“This is an investment you don’t make for one product cycle,” Scaringe said of his company’s planned $5 billion factory an hour east of Atlanta. “You make the investment for many product cycles. It’s a multidecade, multi-billion dollar investment.”

Next year is a vital one for California-based Rivian, which plans to launch R2 at a starting price of $45,000 to target a mass market. The forthcoming Georgia plant is poised to multiply the number of R2s rolling off assembly lines.

Confident it will succeed, Scaringe said the R2 and its iterations will provide the same boost to Rivian that Tesla found with its mid-priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.

Those two Tesla models make up more than 40% of all EV sales this year through September, according to Cox Automotive data. Cox Enterprises, the owner of the AJC, also owns Cox Automotive and a 3% stake in Rivian.

“In something like clothing or cars or goods that reflect your own personality, you tend to see many winners,” Scaringe said. “So having a single player with nearly 50% market share is not a reflection of a healthy market — it’s a reflection of a highly underserved market.”

September was a new high-water mark for EV sales, but it’s expected to be a temporary peak. Federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 for qualifying new EV purchases were revoked at the end of that month, creating a fleeting window of opportunity for the EV curious.

“The training wheels are coming off,” said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of operations management at Cox Automotive. “This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

For Rivian, Scaringe said the startup’s history until now has been about learning and growing. He said Rivian’s Georgia investments will show the company is ready for the expanded spotlight.

“We’re a much, much more mature business,” he said. “And we’ve built processes to handle some of these unexpected externalities.”

Learning curve

The path for Rivian hasn’t been smooth.

The company’s 2021 initial public offering was among the largest in U.S. history. The company’s valuation peaked at more than $100 billion, briefly surpassing juggernauts like Ford, an early Rivian investor, and General Motors.

Rivian also courted other deep-pocked investors including Amazon, inking a $1 billion deal to supply the e-commerce giant with 100,000 EV vans.

But Wall Street’s stratospheric expectations soon came back to Earth amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a supply chain that buckled under the pressure and Rivian’s struggles to meet production demands. Scaringe said it was a tough time for his company, which has yet to turn a profit.

Among the challenges Rivian faced were getting components because it didn’t have the deep manufacturing history of traditional automakers.

“It was a combination of learning for the first time, launching multiple products, dealing with a global pandemic and then being last in line to get parts from suppliers,” he said.

Those scars have informed Rivian’s R2 strategy, reframing Georgia’s role in the company’s long-term plans.

When unveiling the prototype R2 in March 2024, Scaringe sent shock waves through the Peach State by pausing the Georgia plant’s development. The decision was cited as a temporary cost-cutting measure and an effort to focus on launching R2 more quickly from the company’s existing Illinois factory.

Within 24 hours of the R2 reveal, Rivian announced it had nearly 70,000 preorders. Scaringe declined to provide any updates to that figure but said “the excitement hasn’t waned.”

“We didn’t design the business to be selling 50,000 cars a year,” says Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe (center), during an interview with the AJC editorial board at its offices. “We have a cost structure, particularly on the R&D side, that was set up to be a much, much bigger business.” (Natrice Miller/AJC)

Rivian later announced it would resume construction of the Georgia factory in 2026, and will create 7,000 promised jobs.

State and local leaders also provided an estimated $1.5 billion incentive package to recruit Rivian to Georgia. Most of those benefits materialize only if the company meets its job and investment figures by 2030. Rivian will also receive support from a $6.6 billion federal loan.

In recent days, Rivian opened its East Coast headquarters along the Atlanta Beltline, which the company said will employ 500 workers by the end of next year. The back-end research and development work, Scaringe said, is just as vital to Rivian’s success as its mechanical chops.

“We didn’t design the business to be selling 50,000 cars a year,” he said, citing the company’s current production output. “We have a cost structure, particularly on the R & D side, that was set up to be a much, much bigger business.”

Creating leverage

Unlike traditional automakers, Rivian and electrified peers like Tesla have developed a new technology backbone for their vehicles.

Most conventional cars have more than 100 small computers called electronic control units to handle small tasks.

One ECU handles seat adjustments. Another is in charge of side mirror controls. Yet another is tasked with injecting fuel into the engine. Those ECUs are developed by separate part suppliers and often include a mishmash of operating systems.

“It’s a very, very messy architecture,” Scaringe said. “It’s precisely the opposite of what you’d want to have.”

Rivian, along with Tesla, have a handful of more powerful computers called domain control units that handle several tasks. Scaringe said that decision reduces assembly complexity, saves thousands of dollars on computer chips and will pay off once the company reaches a certain scale.

“We have more computer engineers and software engineers at Rivian than we have mechanical engineers by a pretty significant degree,” he said.

For automakers to succeed in the future, Scaringe said, they will have to have a software backbone like Rivian and Tesla. They’ll get there one of two ways — developing it themselves or finding a technology partner.

The company’s technology platform caught the attention of the world’s second-largest automaker, Volkswagen Group.

In June 2024, Rivian and VW announced a joint software partnership worth an estimated $5.8 billion. Rivian agreed to contribute technology to the German auto giant’s fleet of new EVs, while VW’s financial contributions would support Rivian as it ramped up production.

Scaringe said that partnership also gives Rivian newfound leverage when negotiating with suppliers and preparing to launch R2 — both in Illinois and in Georgia.

“(Suppliers) are super excited to work with us because the choice we make in Rivian vehicles is also the choice that goes into Volkswagen vehicles, which is Porsche, Audi, VW, Bentley and a whole host of brands,” Scaringe said. “It’s a complete flip of the nature of that relationship.”

With the groundwork laid — and ground literally about to break east of Atlanta — Scaringe said Rivian’s next chapter is filled with potential.

“Now it’s about execution,” Scaringe said.",https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/YB4POWDQZFBL7FLMLI4LIMVTJA.JPG?auth=3bb53f48c873a9ca346a972ab8d5269786e62c049e8a79be60ed1fe61e406afe&width=1200&height=630&smart=true,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:18.751763

The report outlines a clear path for transforming Lithium Valley into one of the most significant clean energy, domestic supply of critical minerals and advanced manufacturing hubs in the United States.

In 2023, California’s Employment Development Department awarded the Imperial County Workforce Development Board $750,000 to complete a comprehensive Lithium Valley workforce and economic development needs assessment. Following the release of the county’s Request for Proposals on Dec. 19, 2023, some 13 proposals were received by the March 1, 2024, deadline. After a structured evaluation process involving the Valley Works Steering Committee and Evaluation Committee, which was comprised of industry, labor, community and government entities, RAND Corp. received the highest score and the Imperial County Workforce Development Board formally approved a contract with RAND on April 10, 2024, for an amount not to exceed $640,908.

RAND’s report confirms that Imperial County is positioned to become a major leader in lithium extraction, with the potential to generate hundreds of permanent jobs, more than a thousand construction jobs, and strong growth in supporting industries such as logistics, construction, retail, and professional services. RAND notes that if action is taken now, the county may ultimately attract major components of the battery supply chain, including refining, materials processing, cell manufacturing, and recycling. This could unlock billions in long term investment and provide new career pathways for local residents.

“Lithium Valley represents a rare chance to change the trajectory of our region. We are not simply preparing for growth. We are preparing to lead,” said County Executive Officer Dr. Kathleen Lang. “This report shows that if we take deliberate steps to train our workforce, modernize infrastructure and support responsible development, Imperial County can become a national center for innovation and advanced energy production.”

Supervisor Ryan Kelley added, “Imperial County has spent years laying the groundwork for this moment. We have the resource, the talent, and the commitment to ensure that the benefits of Lithium Valley stay with our residents. This is about building a stronger local economy and creating opportunities for families who have lived here for generations.”

Key Opportunities Identified in the Study

The RAND study highlights four areas of focus that will help the County secure the economic benefits of Lithium Valley:

Hiring Local: Establish clear local hire goals, expand job fairs, and build a countywide talent matching portal to ensure residents can connect directly with industry opportunities.

Training Local Workers: Strengthen partnerships between local colleges, union training programs, and employers. Expand certificate programs, apprenticeships, and STEM pathways to prepare residents for technical and managerial roles.

Accelerating Business Growth: Continue developing the county’s “development concierge” approach, establish a county investment fund, expand supplier matchmaking, and host an annual Lithium and Beyond investment summit to attract supporting industries.

Community Infrastructure: Use lithium excise tax revenues to improve housing, broadband, transportation, and essential public services such as childcare, education, and public safety. These investments will ensure residents can access new jobs and enjoy a higher quality of life.

Imperial County Workforce and Economic Development Director Priscilla Lopez, highlighted, “The County is committed to building a workforce that is prepared to participate in the opportunities emerging from Lithium Valley. This effort ensures that local residents are at the center of economic growth, supported by strong training partnerships, clear career pathways, and investments that create long term stability for our communities. We look forward to identifying opportunities from the RAND report to build on this vision.”

Acknowledging Challenges and Providing Solutions

RAND identified several challenges that must be addressed to ensure the opportunity is inclusive and sustainable. These include housing shortages, long permitting timelines, limited engineering capacity, and transportation constraints.

Housing: Rapid development will require additional housing solutions. RAND highlights the need to continue advancing partnerships and zoning updates to accelerate workforce housing and ensure long term affordability for local families.

Streamlined Permitting: Permitting delays may lead to development occurring in other States instead of Imperial County. RAND mentions how the county’s Programmatic Environmental Impact Report and Development Concierge model are reducing uncertainty and providing predictable timelines for responsible developers, but continued efficiencies in permitting is needed at all levels.

Workforce Development: Education and training is critical to ensure residents are equipped for new opportunities. Imperial Valley College, SDSU Imperial Valley, the University of California Riverside, and unions, are launching programs in industrial automation, chemistry, plant operations, and critical minerals analysis.

Transportation and Infrastructure: The county is working to expand road improvements and build transit connections; however, extensive funding mechanisms are needed from the state and federal government to improve the infrastructure in the region. RAND proposes continuing to identify these pathways as well as collaborating with industry for zero fare shuttle services that ensure reliable access to future developments.

“These challenges are important, but they are also solvable,” said Chairman John Hawk. “What matters is that we are planning ahead, acting early, and focusing on strategies that uplift our communities. Our commitment is to ensure that every city and every neighborhood benefits from this opportunity.”

A Hopeful Path Forward

Deputy CEO of Natural Resources, Bari Bean, added, “Lithium Valley is not just a project. It is a long-term vision for prosperity and a way to secure a better future for Imperial County. We are focused on delivering real results and building an economy that works for everyone who calls this region home.”

Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain market share worldwide, despite policy reversals in the US.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) account for most EV sales globally. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have seen significant increases recently, especially in China, shifting from a defensive tool for legacy automakers to a technology that can strengthen China’s global influence.

While long-range PHEVs and extended-range EVs can play a transitional role in US automaking, securing resilient industrial leadership will ultimately depend on advancing BEVs and reducing risks of overdependence in battery value chains.

The global automotive industry is undergoing a historic transformation. Electric vehicles (EVs)—including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—are rapidly gaining market share worldwide. China has experienced the deepest transformation, followed by Europe—despite considerable heterogeneity within it—and by the US.

BEVs account for most EV sales globally, but PHEVs have experienced particularly dynamic growth in recent years.[i] Once viewed as a transitional technology favored by legacy automakers, PHEVs have now become central to China’s domestic EV market growth and to its industrial strategy. Chinese automakers embraced PHEVs and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) as a way to complement BEVs to expand their global reach, effectively leveraging the advantages offered by a deeply rooted and competitive battery supply chain.

The overall global shift to EVs raises a critical question for US automakers and policymakers: Should EVs be defended, ignored, or strategically supported, and if so, which ones?

Because of the scale and pervasiveness of this technological transition, accelerating the shift to EVs would strengthen the resilience of the US auto sector. Instead of policies that focus solely on incremental improvements to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), those that support PHEVs, which retain an internal combustion engine, can play a transitional role to fully battery-powered cars. However, securing resilient industrial leadership will ultimately depend on advancing BEVs and reducing the risks of overdependence on concentrated battery value chains.

BEVs, PHEVs, and Diverging Global Paths

In many regions of the world, the car market has developed in markedly new directions in recent years (see Figure 1). In 2024 plug-in vehicles—both BEVs and PHEVs—accounted for roughly one in five new cars sold worldwide.[ii] Estimates for 2025 point toward increasing market share and a total of roughly 20 million electric cars sold.[iii] Yet beneath this aggregate figure lies striking regional differences in both technology choice and adoption speed.

China

China has experienced the deepest transformation. In 2024 it represented about 60 percent of global EV sales, with BEVs making up the bulk of EV deliveries but PHEVs growing rapidly (see Figure 1). BYD, an automobile manufacturing company headquartered in China, led in total EV sales globally and outsold Tesla on BEVs alone in late 2024.[v] China’s grip on battery manufacturing—from raw material processing to cell production[vi]—enables low costs and high volumes across both BEVs and PHEVs.

Europe

Europe is the second key pole of electrification globally in terms of sales and domestic manufacturing, though with marked heterogeneity among countries and with remaining reliance on China in its battery value chain.[vii] Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are at the forefront of the electrification of the car fleet in the EU, with EVs, and in particular BEVs, already having high market shares.[viii] In contrast, several countries in southern and eastern Europe—including Cyprus, Greece, Italy, and much of central and eastern Europe—lag behind, constrained by lower incomes, higher sensitivity to vehicle purchase prices, and, in the case of Italy, high electricity prices.[ix] Within the EU’s regulatory framework, PHEVs have played a transitional role between ICEVs and BEVs. However, as regulatory signals and tax incentives evolve and charging expands, consumer demand is favoring BEVs.

US

The United States presents a different picture. EVs accounted for 10 percent of its car sales in 2024. BEVs are clearly ahead of PHEVs in terms of new car registrations, representing about 80 percent of total electric car sales that year.[x] This aligns with the outsize role of Tesla in shaping consumer preferences, brand perception, and charging infrastructure.[xi]

While some legacy automakers continue to offer PHEVs, US demand for PHEVs versus ICEVs is structurally constrained by relatively low gasoline prices, resulting in limited space for cost savings from PHEVs. The US capital market also tends to place a significantly higher premium (in terms of market capitalization per unit of vehicle sold) on companies that focus on BEVs rather than PHEVs (and other combustion-based technologies).

Other Markets

The Korean car market has seen EVs rise to nearly 15 percent in 2024 and 2025, with 2025 developments pointing toward an increased focus on BEVs and a stagnation of PHEV sales.[xii] Japan has a technology mix in its domestic market that remained strongly centered on ICEVs and hybrids,[xiii] in line with the focus of its main automakers and concerns about limitations in access to battery material supplies. It recorded limited EV market demand compared with other major developed economies.

From Southeast Asia to parts of Latin America and Africa, there has been a rapid acceleration in EV adoption.[xiv] Much of this expansion is directly or indirectly linked to Chinese investment, both in vehicles (via exports or local assembly) and infrastructure (including charging and battery plants). In markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and parts of Africa, Chinese EVs are gaining market share, while Western automakers are subject to a competitive disadvantage because they focus more on premium segments (which are less affordable) and have lower EV sales volumes overall compared with Chinese competitors.[xv] In other cases, such as Vietnam, the growth in EV market shares was paired with the rise of domestic EV manufacturers. However, they still rely, at least in part, on Chinese battery suppliers.[xvi]

In short, while EV sales are increasing globally, the global EV map remains uneven. China is leading in sales of both BEVs and PHEVs, whereas Europe has a high share of BEV purchases within its electric car market, especially in the North, with a patchier picture elsewhere. The US is BEV-heavy but has a relatively narrow overall EV share. Korea tracks EU developments, with some lag, while Japan maintains a focus on hybrids. Emerging markets are entering the race largely on the back of Chinese industrial and financial support.

Three Drivers of the Transition

The EV transition is not only about technology but also about economics, geopolitics, and climate commitments.

Industrial and Economic Competitiveness

For China, EVs are part of a broader attempt to dominate a future-defining industry.[xvii] For Europe, they are a necessity to preserve automotive leadership while meeting climate obligations.[xviii] For the US, they represent a challenge to the legacy automotive manufacturing and oil sectors—long central to its industrial base—while at the same time offering a pathway to offset risks of net industrial capacity losses, which becomes essential if the US market also shifts toward electrification. Investments in batteries and related supply chains are not just about cars; they are also about commanding value-added industries of the future and industrial production that matters for national security and defense.

Energy and Resource Security

For net oil importers, EVs are a strategic hedge against oil dependence. China, the EU, India, and many African, Latin American, and Southeast Asian countries rely heavily on imported crude and refined products. Reducing oil dependence through electrification—as well as the associated energy efficiency improvements of EVs, which consume about one quarter of the final energy needed by a comparable combustion car[xix]—is therefore an economic and security imperative for countries in these circumstances.

Building a competitive battery value chain also offers resource security if it can leverage—as in the case of oil supplies—a reliable network of global partners. And contrary to oil, battery materials will become increasingly available in economies using BEVs once the vehicles reach the end of their useful life through recycling.

Climate Policies

EV adoption is also propelled by emissions regulations, climate targets, and clean air priorities—such as China’s “new energy vehicle” mandates and the EU’s CO₂ emission standards—as EVs have lower life-cycle emissions than alternative technologies.[xx] The US corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard, state-level “zero emission vehicle” (ZEV) standards developed in California and other states, and other instruments supporting EV demand and infrastructure development were also driven by climate policy goals, though these are now the object of major revisions by the Trump administration.

Importantly, the strength of these three drivers varies: Concerns about energy security and industrial goals tend to reinforce each other in China and the EU, resulting in policies that have supported the EV transition. In the EU, additional synergies came from a strong determination to act on climate. In the US, abundant domestic oil has blunted the energy security case, and while climate was a clear driver of prior policy action on EVs, the current administration does not support policies addressing climate change.[xxi] Despite such headwinds, industrial competitiveness and the promotion of innovation have long been a focus of US policy, and recent trade policy decisions seem to suggest that interest remains in supporting domestically produced EVs and achieving greater diversification of battery supply chains.[xxii] However, this interest comes with a reduced pace and scale for the EV transition, and hence also with delays in emission reductions.

PHEVs: From Defensive Play to China-Centered Growth

The role of PHEVs has evolved markedly over the past decade. In a first phase, they were mainly part of a defensive strategy by legacy original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) In a second phase, growing pressures from BEVs and increasing evidence about the limits of PHEVs to promote energy diversification and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions challenged the effectiveness of this initial strategy. A third, more recent phase is a Chinese offensive strategy to leverage its competitive advantage in batteries and gain global market share.

Initially, PHEVs were developed largely by incumbent automakers as a hedge against BEVs. Legacy manufacturers, heavily invested in ICEV platforms, saw PHEVs as a way to meet regulatory targets without committing to the cost and risk of full battery electrification. In Europe, policy incentives also encouraged this strategy.

PHEVs lost traction and policy support, however, as BEV sales grew (fueled by Tesla and Chinese pure-play EV makers) and critiques pointed to low energy diversification and climate benefits of PHEVs, which run much less than initially expected in all-electric mode. These critiques were backed by strong evidence[xxiii] and confirmed by official data collection,[xxiv] which led to policy revisions in the EU[xxv] and the US.[xxvi]

Since 2022, however, PHEVs have experienced a resurgence, especially in China. Unlike the earlier defensive stance by legacy OEMs in Europe, China’s recent PHEV surge reflects a more offensive strategy. With world-leading battery production, Chinese OEMs such as BYD have launched PHEVs with large batteries and long electric ranges—including in the form of EREVs—ensuring more frequent all-electric operation. Domestic demand soared because of total cost of ownership advantages compared with ICEV, partial eligibility for preferential licensing in Chinese cities,[xxvii] improvements in battery technologies needed in PHEVs,[xxviii] and the introduction of new models with larger batteries and fast-charging capabilities.[xxix] Lower upfront prices for PHEVs compared with BEVs in a few market segments[xxx] may also have played a role. Consumer interest in the flexibility that PHEVs offer compared with BEVs may also have supported demand growth, especially where there is limited cost-effective charging infrastructure.[xxxi] Importantly, exports of PHEVs and EREVs can also provide an avenue to bypass tariffs or countervailing duties, as those tend to focus on BEVs.

By now the fulcrum of PHEV market development has shifted decisively to China. What was once a transitional technology favored by legacy Western OEMs is now being redefined by Chinese firms as a competitive instrument, integrated with global trade strategy and industrial policy.

The Outlook for Electric Vehicles: The US and Beyond

In the US, the structural outlook for PHEVs is limited, while the outlook for BEVs is also weaker than it was before recent policy reversals. Factors that influence market developments include the following:

Reduced compliance value. Policy frameworks (e.g., CAFE standards, ZEV programs) still allow BEVs, EREVs, and PHEVs to generate compliance value, but recent policy reversals are weakening this effect.

Low gasoline prices. By global standards, US fuel prices are low. This reduces the operating-cost savings of driving on electricity, weakening the economic rationale for EVs. However, heterogeneity in fuel prices, state-level regulations, and fiscal incentives can still sustain demand for BEVs and PHEVs in sizable portions of the US. They could also sustain demand for EREVs, but model availability is still limited.

Weak domestic battery base. Compared with China, US battery manufacturing lags in scale and cost competitiveness, limiting the ability of US OEMs to offer low-cost, long-range EVs. Tariffs applicable to long-standing US trade partners exacerbate these challenges.

Battery supply chain challenges. Limited access to battery materials and cells and slower scale-up of domestic battery manufacturing capacity—due to a contraction of the BEV market versus expectations and the negative impacts of tariffs following the recent policy shifts—may delay cost reductions and lower the volumes of domestically manufactured EV batteries. Such a development could result in an increased value proposition for PHEVs and EREVs compared with BEVs, reversing the historically limited demand for PHEVs in the US electric car market.

Battery cost declines. Continued reductions in EV battery costs in other markets may still help tilt the market toward BEVs rather than PHEVs or EREVs. Once purchase prices converge, BEVs’ lower operating costs and better performance make them the predominant choice. The PHEV value proposition—cheaper up front if more expensive over time—erodes in these conditions, especially for legacy configurations.

Charging infrastructure developments. Consumers without reliable charging infrastructure may also prefer PHEVs or EREVs, even in an environment where BEVs become more competitive pricewise.

China

In China, structural drivers behind increased electrification remain strong, despite challenges emerging from increased competition and significant overcapacity. BEVs are therefore bound to continue to account for millions of units sold, as they have in the recent past. PHEV and EREV shares may continue to expand over the next 5 to 10 years, thanks to the same drivers that favored their recent increase, both in terms of domestic demand and utility in circumventing trade barriers when supply is geared toward exports (if the focus of trade barriers on BEVs does not change). The new generation of Chinese PHEVs—including EREVs equipped with larger batteries—is also particularly well suited to meeting requirements regarding all-electric driving shares, which are now also being tightened domestically.[xxxii]

Europe

BEVs are bound to see continued market share increases in Europe. This is driven by policy, particularly the regulation requiring zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2035. It is also driven by economics, including EV technology cost reductions, high oil import dependency, high fuel taxation, the introduction of carbon pricing, and the use of differentiated taxation based on the environmental performance of vehicles, which favors BEVs.

PHEVs have faced declining incentives, especially for models with low all-electric range, because of tightened regulatory requirements.[xxxiii] They are also subject to equity-related challenges, as they have solely been deployed in premium segments, steering incentives meant to support demand creation for EVs toward wealthier people.[xxxiv]

Future policy action will remain focused on road transport electrification, as indicated by the announced proposals regarding corporate fleets,[xxxv] even if revisions to existing regulations are also being considered. Recent announcements regarding smaller, more affordable EVs will help diversify the offer of BEVs and are not likely to favor PHEVs, given their focus on larger and heavier cars.[xxxvi] However, revising the 2035 emission reduction requirements toward greater technological neutrality[xxxvii] could offer opportunities for a greater share of PHEVs in the European EV market than in the current policy framework.

Other Markets

In emerging markets, Chinese EVs are likely going to continue to be cheaper than those from other suppliers, especially for BEVs.[xxxviii] PHEVs may see growing demand where charging infrastructure is limited and where policy requirements for larger battery capacities and higher all-electric driving shares are not yet adopted (while Chinese EREVs can gain interest in cases where this tightening is already in place).

The outlook for Korea points toward an overall EV market share increase that remains less dynamic than in the EU, but with a strengthened focus on BEVs.[xxxix] Japan is expected to continue facing challenges in stimulating domestic EV demand.[xl] However, the export-oriented nature of Korean and Japanese automotive industries and the risks of market share losses in Asia are likely to strengthen the case for greater diversification of their power train offerings toward EVs.

Overall, and especially as batteries get cheaper and charging more widespread, BEVs are more likely to capture the bulk of the EV market growth. However, PHEVs can gain relevance as a strategy for navigating trade-related barriers and in markets that still have limited charging infrastructure. Versions with larger battery capacities are likely to gain more ground as batteries keep improving, costs decline, and policies require growing all-electric ranges.

Policy Recommendations for the US

The current US administration rolled back or paused major federal targets, programs, incentives, and infrastructure deployment investments aimed at accelerating EV adoption.[xli] It rescinded the waiver that allowed California and other states to set EV-related requirements[xlii] and proposed to remove the foundation of what allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate GHG emission standards for vehicles.[xliii] This pullback places a greater focus on protecting traditional internal combustion manufacturing than on leading new technology developments, even as interest remains for diversifying EV battery supply chains. These policy decisions are exacerbated by tariffs applied to US allies, making the competitive challenge from China and other global automakers that are not subject to the same policy reversal (despite the risk of some degree of rollback induced by US policy shifts, especially in Europe) more acute for the US.

Recognizing the scale of the global transformation that is profoundly reshaping the automotive industry—driven by economics and energy/resource security in addition to environmental considerations—is a key prerequisite to improve the competitiveness of US OEMs in this shifting landscape. Doing so is crucial to leverage existing capacity in the automotive sector and support investments in new industrial assets. To do so, US policymakers could enact policies that accomplish the following:

Preserve and strengthen regulatory requirements on EVs, including the EPA’s ability to regulate GHG emission standards for vehicles, maintain CAFE standards, and allow California and other states to set EV-related requirements. These policies drive investment and innovation that are critical in this phase of global competition for the creation of new industrial capacity.

Reinstate EV purchase incentives while also integrating equity-related considerations, such as focusing the incentives toward low-income households and businesses and using vehicle price caps for the applicability of the incentives. If budgetary implications are a concern, incentives could integrate provisions that enable them to be budget neutral, evolving from the exclusive use of credits toward a combination of incentives for EVs and fees for ICEVs. Specific conditions for the applicability of incentives can also support the diversification of EV battery supply chains; for example, they could use emission intensity thresholds for the manufacturing of batteries equipping EVs.

Use public procurement toward EVs when beneficial to the government and industry. Instruct federal institutions—including the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the General Services Administration, and any other relevant federal departments and agencies—to support an anticipated industry shift toward EVs. Public procurement mechanisms can also integrate the use of specific conditions regarding the attributes of batteries equipping EVs, setting minimum thresholds to support the diversification of EV battery supply chains. They can also coordinate with policies of the DOE’s Office of Energy Dominance Financing (formerly the Loan Programs Office) to include specific provisions supporting innovation on mineral extraction and processing technologies (such as direct lithium extraction) to support the diversification of battery supply chains).[xliv]

Support the deployment of EV charging infrastructure, stimulating private investments. Re-staff and revitalize the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation (JOET). Focus its public spending on cases that are economically more challenging but strategically relevant to secure affordable access to EV chargers across the US to make the EV transition coherent and not just inevitable. Leverage public service contracts tied to affordability conditions regarding charging prices. Allocate specific support to the installation and maintenance of EV chargers in underserved communities. If budgetary implications are a concern, leverage a moderate carbon price on emission-intensive fuels used in road transport to address it.

Stimulate investments in cell manufacturing, recycling, and critical minerals processing in the US and in friendly or allied nations. This is crucial not only for cost parity but also for energy security and industrial resilience. Long-term, predictable regulations need to enable more clarity for demand prospects. Other instruments that can support domestic production include financing structures that reduce investment risks; targeted government interventions such as direct subsidies, grants, or tax credits; and friendshoring.[xlv] China’s EV offensive is possible because of its strength across the battery supply chain; further US delays in domestic production will be detrimental to the US and its allies. If the cost of policies aimed to support investments in new industrial capacity concerns is seen as a key challenge, carbon pricing can help raise revenues to mitigate their impacts.

Phase out incentives and public procurement support for PHEVs with limited all-electric range. Without clear sunset clauses, policy decisions could amplify asset-stranding risks and slow the realignment of industrial capabilities toward automotive technologies that will continue to define global competitiveness in the coming decades. Policies that continue to favor PHEVs rather than BEVs risk exacerbating the greater EV competitive disadvantage for the US automotive industry.

And what is big could be the potential deal for peace as Ukraine is talking, but it also could be weather.","Oil prices have gone into hibernation, and the diesel crack spread has come back down as peace hopes and LNG exports from the US to Europe are rising. US Energy policy is playing a part in the peace process and raising hopes that parts of Europe won/t freeze this winter. There has been a modest shift toward risk off mode in oil, gold, and silver markets following reports that US and Ukrainian negotiators have developed an “updated and refined peace framework.”

The parties announced on Sunday their intention to continue advancing the peace plan in the coming days. According to a joint statement, discussions related to the US-backed plan in Geneva, which are now believed to have concluded, were described as “highly productive.”

We also had OIL price report that we have seen the European benchmark natural gas prices slipped below the key threshold of 30 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh) on Monday, for the first time in a year and a half, amid strong LNG flows, milder temperatures, and negotiations about the end of the war in Ukraine.

The move lower of the past week has been accelerated by the discussions about the U.S. peace plan for Ukraine, forecasts of milder temperatures in northwest Europe in the weeks ahead and continued strong LNG flows into Europe amid tepid demand in Asia. Also, record-breaking US LNG Exports are playing a part in easing market concerns.

US Energy Policy is having a major impact and the Energy Information Administration ( ) reports the US South is experiencing a natural gas pipeline boom with as many as 12 projects to install new pipelines or expand existing ones on pace to be completed next year in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.

The new systems will carry enough gas to supply all of Canada and will increase the region’s capacity to ship gas by 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from US Energy Information Administration estimates.

The pipelines will mostly feed the wave of LNG terminals scheduled to start operating in 2027 and beyond, driven by soaring demand for gas around the globe and the US being the world’s largest producer and exporter of fuel.

The biggest natural gas pipeline boom in nearly 20 years is unfolding in the US South as companies build systems to feed massive export terminals rising along the Gulf of Mexico.

As many as 12 projects to install new pipelines or expand existing ones are on pace to be completed next year in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, increasing the region’s capacity to ship gas by 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from US Energy Information Administration estimates. It will mark the biggest one-year expansion for Gulf Coast pipelines since the height of the shale-gas boom in 2008.

And let’s not forget Alaska—it’s making American oil great again! For the first time in nearly 40 years, the Last Frontier is set for a real oil revival, with production expected to jump by 55,000 barrels a day in 2026. That’s a 13% surge, more of a plateau than a full-blown turnaround, but still worth tossing your hard hat in the air. According to our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, Alaskan crude output will climb to 477,000 barrels a day, the highest since 2018. After years of decline, this is the biggest annual increase since the Reagan era.

So, what’s fueling this comeback? It’s all about two game-changers up on Alaska’s North Slope. First, the Nuna project from stormed onto the scene in December 2024, and it’s gunning for a peak of 20,000 barrels a day. In August 2025, Nuna delivered 7,000 barrels daily, holding the line against the usual production slip. Then there’s Pikka Phase 1, the blockbuster partnership between and Repsol. Production kicks off in early 2026 and aims to hit a whopping 80,000 barrels per day by mid-year—that’s nearly 20% of Alaska’s total 2025 output!

These new wells aren’t just good—they’re outclassing most of their Alaskan cousins. Fresh numbers from the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission show these wells pumping out about 480 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while nearly 80% of other wells in the state lagged below 400 BOE/d last year. The forecast for 2026 keeps getting brighter, thanks to Santos’s fast-tracked ramp-up plans and promising well tests that just won’t quit.

And it’s not just Alaska making headlines. Down south, a massive pipeline buildout is sweeping across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. It’s the biggest Gulf Coast natural gas expansion since the shale revolution of 2008, according to Bloomberg. American energy isn’t just back—it’s breaking records and setting the stage for a whole new era.

As many as a dozen projects are slated for completion next year, enough to boost the region’s gas-shipping capacity by 13%, or about the equivalent of Canada’s total consumption, according to US Energy Information Administration data.

“This is the most activity I’ve seen in my 20 years in the industry,” said Jack Weixel of East Daley Analytics. Bloomberg Reports that Oil extended after the biggest weekly loss since early October, as traders weighed the prospect of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal that could increase crude flows into an already well-supplied market.

traded above $62 a barrel after slumping almost 3% last week, while West Texas Intermediate was below $58. European leaders and other allies have told the US the plan needed more work to try and restrain a Trump administration looking to give concessions to Russia and impose terms by Thanksgiving. Following US-Ukrainian talks on Sunday in Geneva, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that President Donald Trump’s proposed Nov. 27 deadline to secure Ukraine’s support for the plan could drift into the following week.

You know, I think when it comes to Thanksgiving week, traditionally and historically we’ve seen some incredible moves out of the blue. It’s kind of disturbing that the market is so quiet, because we expect something big to happen at any moment. And what is big could be the potential deal for peace as Ukraine is talking, but it also could be weather. Be on guard for big moves, but right now the market’s very quiet. I think natural gas gaped down a little bit earlier overnight, but it should start rebounding here as we get forecasts for wickedly cold weather over the Thanksgiving Day holiday.

Fox Weather reports that heavy rain and severe storms are causing flooding in Texas, affecting record-breaking Thanksgiving travel. Thunderstorms hit North Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas early Monday, bringing strong winds and rain along Interstates 20 and 35 as millions begin their holiday journeys. More storms are expected to threaten flights later Monday as weather moves east, with a flash flood risk stretching from Austin to Nashville.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 14:01:55.930561

Automated control ensures the efficiency and stability required to produce hydrogen that meets both cost and carbon benchmarks, easing adoption for risk-averse heavy manufacturers.
Automakers must now validate the provenance and embedded carbon of battery materials under regulations such as the EU’s battery passport.
The session demonstrated that while decarbonization technologies vary — from electrochemical hydrogen production to AI-driven traceability to controlled tire depolymerization — they share a common infrastructure.
As global markets tighten carbon constraints, it will be automated intelligence, not individual equipment innovations, that maps the practical pathway to a low-carbon manufacturing future.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

Part of the chain of renewable energy and the transition from fossil fuels is how to handle carbon-intensive products and byproducts of society and push for low carbon content at source, at processing, or disposal. At Rockwell Automation’s 2025 Automation Fair, a panel of industry leaders offered a rare, unified look at how automation is enabling low-carbon transformation across manufacturing.

The discussion, moderated by Rockwell’s EMEA head of public relations Stan Miller, explored how advanced control systems, digital traceability, and electrochemical innovation are converging to reshape circular production and regulatory compliance. Taken together, the dialogue illustrated a central theme: automation is no longer a supporting tool — it is the backbone of emerging decarbonization strategies.

The session brought together experts whose technologies operate in entirely different segments of heavy industry yet face the same transition pressures. Bolder Industries founder and CEO Tony Wibbeler described how scrap tires, traditionally destined for landfills or tire-derived fuel, are being depolymerized into new feedstocks such as recovered carbon black and circular oils.

Utility Global COO Derek Kramer outlined an electrochemical route for cost-competitive clean hydrogen production, featured from industrial waste gases, which CleanTechnica already featured. Circulor’s commercial operations director Bill Zierolf detailed how digital traceability is being deployed across critical mineral and battery supply chains to meet a rising tide of disclosure mandates. Though their domains vary, all three leaders pointed to automation as the differentiating factor enabling consistency, economic viability and regulatory alignment.

Kramer said clean hydrogen is being shaped almost entirely by policy pressure, particularly in Europe and Asia where carbon-intensity scoring is now tied to financial consequences. Steelmakers and petrochemical producers must cut emissions without compromising global competitiveness. He argued that Utility Global’s electrochemical module which Tina Casey wrote about here, allows facilities to lower scope 1 through scope 3 emissions while producing hydrogen at a levelized cost below market alternatives. Automation underpins that value proposition. A new hydrogen technology must overcome not only technical hurdles but also the economics of retrofitting capital-intensive plants. Automated control ensures the efficiency and stability required to produce hydrogen that meets both cost and carbon benchmarks, easing adoption for risk-averse heavy manufacturers.

Wibbeler described similarly strong regulatory drivers in the circular materials space. European producer-responsibility rules are shifting end-of-life liability to tire companies just as regions begin restricting tire-derived fuel. With carbon black markets tightening and OEMs facing their own emissions disclosures, demand for domestic, non-petroleum circular feedstocks is accelerating. Bolder Industries, which has maintained in-spec product since 2019, relies on precise automation to standardize depolymerization across facilities in Missouri, Indiana, and a new site under construction in Antwerp.

Unlike mature manufacturing sectors, tire depolymerization has no established labor pipeline. Automation not only ensures quality but becomes an integral training and workforce-development tool. According to Wibbeler, labor is the company’s largest cost; embedding automation into every phase of the process drives consistency, reduces operating expense and enables rapid replication of the model globally.

When the conversation turned to digital traceability, Zierolf emphasized that transparency is no longer optional. Automakers must now validate the provenance and embedded carbon of battery materials under regulations such as the EU’s battery passport. The greatest barrier, he said, is the reluctance of upstream suppliers to share proprietary data. Circulor’s SaaS platform addresses those concerns by establishing controlled data pathways, integrating with on-site systems and automating emissions accounting that previously relied on spreadsheets. Automation shifts traceability from a manual, error-prone exercise into an auditable digital record.

That record not only drives compliance but enables manufacturers to identify upstream emissions hotspots, remediate suppliers and use transparency as a market differentiator. Zierolf cited examples ranging from Hitachi Rail’s aluminum and battery supply chains to consumer-facing QR codes on Volvo vehicles. Even battery recyclers now use automated traceability as evidence that recovered “black mass” is produced responsibly.

As discussion moved toward system-level impacts, Kramer positioned hydrogen as a foundational, long-term component of the global energy mix. Hydrogen carries three times the energy of natural gas and produces none of its fugitive emissions, but its viability depends on widespread production with low carbon intensity. Automation will be essential to that scale-up, ensuring reliability, minimizing operational overhead and enabling continuous optimization of energy use.

Wibbeler concluded by reframing circularity in terms of responsibility rather than sustainability. Nearly 90% of a tire originates from petroleum. Recovering that material repeatedly, he argued, offers the most practical emissions reduction achievable in the near term. Localized manufacturing amplifies the impact, shrinking transport emissions and reducing dependence on imported carbon black. Bolder Industries views its platform not solely as tire recycling but as a prototype for circular materials manufacturing across other petrochemical-derived products. Automation makes that repeatability possible.

The session demonstrated that while decarbonization technologies vary — from electrochemical hydrogen production to AI-driven traceability to controlled tire depolymerization — they share a common infrastructure. Automation enables consistent quality, lowers production cost, creates verifiable data, and embeds regulatory readiness into industrial systems.

As global markets tighten carbon constraints, it will be automated intelligence, not individual equipment innovations, that maps the practical pathway to a low-carbon manufacturing future.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hydrogen_Out.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 17:02:25.437708

Foolish Take

Gemmstock Limited, a London-based investment manager, recently bought more than $18 million worth of Gulfport Energy stock, bringing its holdings to over $34 million as of September 30, 2025. Here's what average investors need to know.

For starters, Gulfport is relatively small energy production company, which is highly-leveraged to natural gas production in the U.S. Therefore, Gemmstock's acquisition is a bullish bet on US energy production. Moreover, as energy producers are highly affected by the price of the commodities they bring to the surface, Gemmstock is also taking a stance on natural gas prices as we head into the winter in the northern hemisphere.

As for performance, Gulfport has solidly outperformed key benchmarks over the last three years. Since 2022, the stock has generated a total return of 151%, equating to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. That beats the S&P 500, which has generated a total return of 71% over the same period, with a CAGR of 19.7%.

What's more, Gulfport has also bested the performance of key exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within the energy sector, such as the State Street SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Expl & Prod ETF (XOP) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE). Those funds have produced total returns of -9% and 7%, with CAGRs of -3.3% and 2.4%, respectively.

In summary, investors who are seeking exposure to the energy sector may want to consider Gulfport, due to this recent large institutional purchase, in addition to the stock's solid performance history versus market and industry benchmarks.

Following the longest government shutdown in history, Congress remains at an impasse over whether to extend enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). With the 2026 open enrollment period now in full swing, millions of marketplace enrollees—from entrepreneurs and small business owners to small business employees, caregivers, and parents—are experiencing significant premium shock. Skyrocketing premiums come at a time when millions are already struggling with the high cost of living, forcing consumers to make difficult choices about their health insurance and ultimately their health care.

Meanwhile, debate barrels on in Congress with no clear path to extending the enhanced premium tax credits. With a Senate vote looming and reports of an impending White House proposal, this article discusses what has transpired in the past two months, the current state of the debate, and what might come next. This continued fight over enhanced premium tax credits is happening as millions of families are left watching and waiting for relief from higher health care costs for 2026.

Background On Premium Tax Credits

The ACA has included premium tax credits to help improve affordability and expand access to coverage in the individual market since the law was enacted in 2010. Beginning in 2014, individuals with an annual income between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) could qualify for premium tax credits that were available on a sliding-scale basis. An individual with an annual income between 100 and 133 percent FPL had to contribute about 2 percent of their income towards premiums, while an individual with an annual income between 300 and 400 percent FPL had to contribute up to 9.78 percent of their income towards premiums.

Under the law, consumers can opt to receive premium tax credits in advance. If a consumer chooses this option, the amount of premiums that they owe to their insurer is automatically reduced each month; the consumer pays only the “discounted” portion of the premium that is not otherwise covered by the premium tax credit. This reduction occurs because the Department of Health and Human Services makes a direct payment to their insurer on the consumer’s behalf. Consumers are not required to choose this option and can instead pay the full premium to their insurer each month. Those who choose this option receive the full amount of premium tax credits at tax time.

Take a consumer whose premiums are, say, $500 per month. If she qualifies for premium tax credits of $450 per month based on her income, she could (1) choose to have this tax credit sent to her insurer in advance so that she pays only $50 per month to her insurer; or (2) choose to forego the advance tax credit so that she pays the entire $500 per month to her insurer and then receives the full $450 per month as part of her tax refund the following year. Most consumers choose the advance premium tax credit option because few can afford to pay the full premium each month and wait for tax time.

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits First Adopted In 2021

Democrats in Congress built on the ACA’s existing subsidies beginning with the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The American Rescue Plan Act increased marketplace access and affordability by (1) eliminating the ACA subsidy cliff for people whose income is more than 400 percent FPL; and (2) increasing ACA subsidies for lower-income people. These enhancements were initially in place only for 2021 and 2022. In 2022, Democrats in Congress extended these premium tax credits through the end of 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Eliminating The Subsidy Cliff

First, the American Rescue Plan Act eliminated the subsidy cliff at 400 percent FPL. Individuals and families above this income level were not previously eligible for PTCs, leaving many middle-income people—especially those who are older and live in rural areas—with extraordinarily high premiums. To address this cliff, the American Rescue Plan Act made those whose income exceeds 400 percent FPL newly eligible for premium tax credits if the cost of premiums exceeds 8.5 percent of their household income. While some higher-income people can conceivably qualify for premium tax credits, this provision does not subsidize the wealthiest people because the vast majority of wealthy people do not face a premium burden that exceeds this income threshold.

Increasing Existing Subsidies

Second, the American Rescue Plan Act bolstered existing subsidies for those who already qualified under the ACA (i.e., those whose income is between 100 and 400 percent FPL). As noted above, those whose income was 100 percent FPL had to contribute about 2 percent of their annual income towards premiums while those whose income was above 300 percent FPL had to contribute nearly 10 percent of their annual income towards premiums.

The American Rescue Plan Act maintained the sliding-scale nature of premium tax credits but reduced the premium percentage at all income levels (above 100 percent FPL). Those with incomes from 100 to 150 percent FPL became eligible for no-premium coverage (i.e., they contribute no income towards premiums for a silver benchmark plan). The premium contribution increases as income increases but was ultimately capped at no more than 8.5 percent of income for those with higher incomes. This change increased the generosity of premium tax credits because the federal government paid a greater proportion of consumer premiums relative to the ACA as originally enacted in 2010.

The Impact Of Enhanced Premium Tax Credits

From nearly five years, the enhanced premium tax credits have helped ensure that more low- and middle-income families can afford health insurance in the individual market. Under current law, lower-income people can enroll in free or nearly-free silver plans, and middle-income people who purchase their own health insurance have their out-of-pocket premiums capped (meaning they cannot be forced to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income towards premiums alone).

The enhanced premium tax credits have led to significant coverage gains: marketplace enrollment doubled from about 12 million people for 2021 to more than 24 million people for 2025. The biggest enrollment gains were seen in states such as Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. Enrollees have seen significant savings: in 2023, nearly 15 million people saw an average of $800 in annual premium savings thanks to the enhanced premium tax credits, and projections of annual household spending on premiums and out-of-pocket costs fell in 2025 across all income groups.

Without an extension, millions of consumers will face higher health care costs. An estimated 22 million people will see their premium liability increase, with premium payments more than doubling for 2026. Those that cannot afford these higher premiums will drop their coverage, leading to more than 4 million more uninsured people by 2034. Still others may turn to non-comprehensive options that, as many consumers learn only too late, have lower premiums but do not cover preexisting conditions or comprehensive benefits. These impacts will be felt beyond marketplace enrollees alone: as research from the Commonwealth Fund has shown, the loss of enhanced premium tax credits will lead to job losses, lower state and local tax revenues, and lower rural hospital revenue.

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits And The 2025 Government Shutdown

Much of this year’s health care debate centered not on the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits but on the sweeping changes that were considered and ultimately enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This legislation was signed into law by President Trump on July 4, 2025 and includes significant changes to the ACA, Medicaid, and more. (Republicans in Congress could have extended, or otherwise altered, the enhanced premium tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which makes several changes to marketplace rules and premium tax credit eligibility. But Republicans did not take on the subsidy structure in the legislation.)

The multi-month fight over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act left less room to educate or warn the public about the looming expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. But this concern came to a head in September 2025 when Democrats in Congress seized on an extension as one of their primary demands in continuing to fund the federal government ahead of an October 1 deadline.

As Democrats prioritized enhanced premium tax credits, Republicans in Congress and President Trump declined to negotiate, insisting that any negotiations occur only after the government was funded. On September 19, the US House of Representatives advanced a continuing resolution on largely a party-line vote before going on recess for nearly two months. The Senate held several votes on this funding measure, but all failed. Even with the support of a few Democratic senators and one Independent senator, the bill did not have the 60 votes needed to advance.

That remained true until November 10 when the Senate passed a new continuing resolution by a vote of 60 to 40. Seven Democratic senators and one Independent senator joined with all but one Republican to advance the bill. These eight senators voted in favor of the new funding measure after securing (1) funding for most of the federal government through January 30; (2) the promise of a Senate vote on the extension of enhanced premium tax credits in mid-December; (3) the inclusion of a bipartisan three-bill appropriations package with full-year appropriations for SNAP, WIC, and the Department of Veterans Affairs; and (4) a reversal of the mass layoffs of federal workers that occurred during the shutdown and a ban on further mass layoffs through late January. The House of Representatives approved this legislation by a vote of 222 to 209, and President Trump signed the continuing resolution into law on November 12 to end the record 43-day government shutdown.

(ACA historians know that this is the second time that the government has been shut down over an ACA-related dispute. In 2013, the federal government was shut down for 16 days after some Republicans declined to join with Democrats in Congress to fund the government unless the bill also delayed or repealed parts of the ACA. This shutdown coincided with the bumpy rollout of HealthCare.gov in October 2013.)

Where Things Stand On Enhanced Premium Tax Credits

As of November 21, there is not a clear path to extending the enhanced premium tax credits. Senate leadership committed to a mid-December vote on legislation to extend the enhanced premium tax credits. But it is not clear when this vote will occur, the process that will be used, whether both parties will put forward dueling legislative proposals, or whether there will be bipartisan support for an extension. Further complicating this path, House leadership has not committed to holding a vote. And President Trump has resumed criticizing the ACA and has opposed any deal that does not restructure the premium tax credit. Even in the face of such uncertainty, this section describes some of the most recent and prominent policy proposals related to the enhanced premium tax credits.

Bipartisan Proposals

There have been several bipartisan proposals to extend the enhanced premium tax credits in the House. In September 2025, Reps. Jennifer Kiggans (R-VA) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY), among others, introduced a “clean” one-year extension of the tax credits. The extension is “clean” because the bill would make no additional changes beyond extending the expiration date through the end of 2026.

This was followed by a mid-November bipartisan effort led by Reps. Sam Liccardo (D-CA) and Kevin Kiley (R-CA). According to the sponsors, this bill would extend the enhanced premium tax credits for two years but cap eligibility at 600 percent FPL; incorporate the Insurance Fraud Accountability Act to stop fraud by agents and brokers; and leverage savings from the No UPCODE Act to address upcoding by Medicare Advantage insurers.

Even more recently, a bipartisan group of House members introduced a bill to extend the enhanced premium tax credits for two years while (1) capping eligibility to those whose income is up to 935 percent FPL; and (2) setting higher contribution limits for those whose income is between 600 and 935 percent FPL (ranging from 8.5 percent to 9.35 percent of annual income towards premiums). The bill would also improve federal oversight of agents and brokers through new transparency requirements, new civil and criminal penalties, and an extensive enrollment verification process for those enrolled through HealthCare.gov by an agent or broker. Marketplaces would also have to conduct more regular audits to prevent the enrollment of deceased individuals, notify consumers of their advance premium tax credit before enrollment, and extend the 2026 open enrollment period through May 15, 2026.

These bipartisan proposals have been introduced in the House with no companions in the Senate. While there appear to be bipartisan discussions in the Senate, these efforts remain informal, making it difficult to assess whether there is a bipartisan path forward. Indeed, a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing on health care costs was largely partisan, with Republicans focused on criticizing the ACA and Democrats focused on the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits.

Democratic Proposals

Democrats in Congress have long fought to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, including by introducing a permanent, clean extension in January 2025. More recently, Senate and House Democrats put forward a bill to permanently extend the enhanced premium tax credits and repeal the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s cuts to Medicaid and the ACA. Neither effort was taken up in the Republican-controlled House or Senate.

Just ahead of the deal to end the government shutdown, Senate Democrats proposed a one-year extension of the enhanced premium tax credits, a package of three bipartisan appropriations bills, and creation of a bipartisan committee to negotiate any additional changes to the ACA. This offer was rejected. And House Democrats filed a discharge petition to try to force a vote on legislation to extend the enhanced premium tax credits for three years. This effort did not attract Republican support and thus has not garnered the 218 votes needed to proceed.

Beyond the subsidies themselves, Democrats have proposed legislation that could be relevant to a bipartisan deal. One example is the Insurance Fraud Accountability Act, which is referenced above in one of the bipartisan efforts and would tamp down on fraudulent activities by agents and brokers.

Republican Proposals

To my knowledge, Republicans have yet to coalesce behind a legislative proposal and have largely just begun discussing policy options. These discussions have been described as “in the very nascent stages of negotiation” even as millions of consumers face premium shock beginning in 2026. And while some Republicans are open to extending the enhanced premium tax credits, many remain staunchly opposed to the ACA—even reigniting calls to repeal the law.

It is difficult to predict where the Republican party as a whole and President Trump might land—and we still lack details to be able to parse any proposals. But some Republicans appear to support:

Changes To Income Eligibility Levels

There could be support for once again capping premium tax credit eligibility at, say, 400 percent FPL—or at a higher income such as 600 percent FPL. Republicans have raised concerns about the current income-eligibility structure even though very few higher-income people qualify for premium tax credits. If Congress creates a new subsidy cliff, some middle-income families could find themselves without any help with their premiums.

Changes To Subsidy Levels

There could be support for raising out-of-pocket premiums by increasing the amount that consumers must contribute towards premiums. Citing concerns about alleged fraud, Republicans may push to amend the subsidy levels to require all consumers, including very low-income consumers, to contribute some amount towards their monthly premiums. This would eliminate access to no-premium silver benchmark plans and make it harder for lower-income people to afford coverage and care.

Changes To The Subsidy Structure

There could be support for dramatic changes to the way that consumers currently receive and use premium tax credits. To date, House and Senate Republicans have proposed to eliminate the ACA’s enhanced premium tax credits to fund health savings accounts (HSAs). The framework proposed by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, would eliminate enhanced premium tax credits and use those funds for HSAs so consumers in bronze marketplace coverage could pay for out-of-pocket costs (but not premiums). While this could benefit a narrow set of consumers, it would do little for those who can no longer afford their premiums without the enhanced premium tax credits—or those who are enrolled in a silver or gold plan. And the ACCESS Act, which was introduced by House Republicans in early 2025, would appropriate funds for cost-sharing reductions and use the resulting savings to fund HSAs for use with high-deductible marketplace plans.

Sen. Tim Scott’s (R-SC) proposal would go even further by allowing states to convert the entirety of the ACA’s premium tax credits into HSA-style accounts that could be used to purchase any type of health insurance plan. This bill would allow federal funds to be used for non-ACA options that discriminate against people with preexisting conditions and do not cover comprehensive benefits—and would likely lead to adverse selection in the marketplaces, leading to higher premiums.

Changes To Abortion Coverage

There could be support for new nationwide restrictions on abortion coverage through marketplace plans. The ACA has long deferred to state decisions on abortion coverage. Where abortion is covered, insurers are prohibited from using federal funds to pay for abortion services that fall outside the Hyde Amendment’s narrow exceptions and must also comply with a wide range of other restrictions. New restrictions on abortion would make it impossible for marketplace plans to cover abortion services while still receiving federal funds, leading insurers to drop this care and forcing women to go without the coverage they need in the 25 states and DC where abortion coverage is currently allowed or required.

It remains to be seen if Democrats will support these or similar ideas, each of which would lead to higher out-of-pocket health care costs for consumers and significant disruption—especially for 2026. The potential for disruption is among the reasons why stakeholders and several members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican, have pushed for a straightforward extension of the enhanced premium tax credits for 2026 with more lead time to implement any broader policy changes.

Looking Ahead

With mid-December rapidly approaching, time is of the essence if Congress wants to stave off severe premium hikes for millions of consumers. As Congress continues to try to negotiate across the aisle, President Trump remains a wild card. To date, President Trump’s involvement in the negotiations has been quite limited. I believe he’s met only once with Democratic leadership and has recently criticized the ACA and health insurers. But Senate Republicans have reportedly been urging President Trump to support a short-term extension of the enhanced premium tax credits to buy time for a longer-term negotiation and other changes to the ACA. If President Trump voices support for such an option, at least some congressional Republicans would presumably back him.

Meanwhile, open enrollment continues for 2026. Given consumer concern and confusion about rising premiums, enrollment data from HealthCare.gov and the state-based marketplaces will be especially important to understand how the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits is contributing to enrollment (or lack thereof) across the country. The first big deadline will be December 15, 2025 for those who want coverage in effect for January 1, 2026. But that will not be the end of open enrollment for 2026, which ends on January 15, 2026 for HealthCare.gov. This final deadline will fall just ahead of the January 30, 2026 deadline to, once again, fund much of the government.",https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20251124.459113/full/media/crossroads_forefront.png,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:51.208941

After six long weeks, the federal government reopened with the passage of the Republican spending package in Congress. This was Congressional Democrats’ one real opportunity to win changes to improve people’s lives — and eight Senators blew it.

The package required some Democratic votes in the Senate to reach the 60-vote threshold to stop the filibuster and pass. Senate Democrats worked to leverage this limited power to protect healthcare for millions and rein in Trump’s dangerous dismantling of our government. Trump and Congressional Republicans balked at these protections. They refused to negotiate and drove the country into the longest government shutdown in history.

In the end, eight Senators in the Democratic Caucus caved and joined Republicans to pass a spending package with little to show for it. They paved the way for even more dangerous Trump cuts, while failing to secure any meaningful commitments from Congressional Republicans on more affordable healthcare.

This shutdown only emphasized the cruelty of Trump and his allies. And the spending fight to protect clean water funding will continue into 2026. Here’s what you need to know:

Trump’s Shutdown Is Historic for its Length and its Cruelty

This was no ordinary government shutdown. At 43 days, it was the longest federal shutdown in history, surpassing the record Trump set during his last term. In another unusual and shameful move, Speaker Mike Johnson put the House on a paid vacation throughout it all and longer.

Beyond the expected dangers of a federal shutdown, Trump’s shutdown was staggering in its cruelty. The Trump administration sought to inflict maximum pain on its political opponents, with regular people suffering the consequences. Trump announced plans to target what he called “Democrat agencies” with mass firings of some 4,000 federal workers. His administration cut or froze nearly $28 billion in infrastructure projects in Democratic jurisdictions.

And for the first time ever, the federal government paused support for SNAP food assistance. The Trump administration refused to use nearly $5 billion in a contingency fund set aside for emergencies. Instead, it illegally withheld SNAP benefits for November.

After two federal court orders mandated that the administration release the funding, the Trump administration appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to take food away from struggling families.

The decision to freeze SNAP food assistance used low-income families as pawns. Trump was willing to allow millions to starve to get his way. Hunger was a policy choice Trump and Congressional Republicans made.

The Spending Package Greenlights Trump’s Dangerous Cuts

So what was included in the deal? The spending package that passed earlier this month included a “continuing resolution,” which extends current funding levels for most of the federal government for just a few months, to January 30, 2026. This includes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the main source of federal funding for safe and clean water.

Senate Democrats added some protections for federal workers from mass layoffs, undoing Trump’s illegal firings during the shutdown and extending those layoff protections through January 30, 2026. The package also includes full-year bills that fund about 10% of the federal government through September 30, 2026.

However, the bill doesn’t include the sought-for extension of Affordable Care Act healthcare subsidies, without which many people’s insurance costs will skyrocket; some by hundreds of dollars. The Senate Democrats who voted for this spending package secured only the mere promise of a vote on the extension in December from Republican leadership; House leadership made no such promise.

Alarmingly, the legislation also contained no protections from Trump’s dangerous rescissions, which are cuts to Congressionally-approved funding that bypass any negotiation with Democrats. Food & Water Watch led a letter from more than 200 groups asking Senate Democratic leadership to use the spending bill to block partisan rescissions.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who is the top Democrat appropriator in the House, fought to add such “No Kings” provisions to the full-year spending bills, but she was cut out of negotiations at the last minute. Now, without these protections, Trump and his allies remain empowered to eliminate programs that communities rely on, with little opportunity for Democrats to fight back.

Good News and Bad News on Food

The full-year bills in the spending package included funding for the Department of Agriculture, many of whose programs channel important funds to families and farmers.

The agriculture bill funds SNAP food assistance for the rest of the fiscal year through September 30, 2026. But that news is less of a relief when the bill does nothing to change the massive cuts to SNAP in Trump’s Big Ugly Bill, which took food assistance away from 4 million people.

The agriculture spending bill, however, cuts funding for funds that farmers and rural communities rely on, including $100 million from Conservation Technical Assistance and $32.6 million from rural water grants.

It also includes a major giveaway to large industrial farms, allowing corporate ag giants to grab funds meant for conservation through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program.

The good news: The spending bill fully funds the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). This is a testament to our work calling attention to the threats to WIC and our members pressuring lawmakers to protect it; the original House spending bill would have underfunded this program by about $600 million over the course of the year.

Additionally, the deal extends many remaining pieces of the Farm Bill for a year, including funding for research on sustainable and organic agriculture. And fortunately, our advocacy stopped Congress from including a proposal to federally block state and local animal welfare laws, called the EATS Act, in this round of bills.

The Battle Isn’t Over — Join Our Fight to Fund Safe, Lead-Free Water!

The Congressional spending battle isn’t over. Much of the federal government, including the EPA and its clean water programs, are only funded until January 30, 2026. Over the next two months, Congress will debate legislation to fund these programs for a full year. Clean water funds may end up on the chopping block.

House Republicans want to eliminate $662 million from the State Revolving Fund programs, which are the main source of federal funding for safe and clean water. The House’s spending bill (H.R.4754) would cut these funds to the lowest level since 2008. This would mean fewer essential infrastructure improvements that make our water clean, safe, and affordable.

Meanwhile, the Senate has proposed to eliminate $250 million from funding already provided to replace toxic lead water pipes. The Senate spending bill (S.2431) cuts funding for lead pipe replacements passed in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021. These funds were set to go out the door. This is the last year of funding provided by that law, and communities must get every cent.

These proposed cuts make lawmakers’ agenda clear: dirty, toxic water. As Congress debates these cuts over the next few months, we’ll be working to make sure they change course and defend clean water funding. Our leaders must do better and protect safe, lead-free water for everyone.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Congress-Evergreen-Featured-Image-1024x427.png,N,,2025-11-24 14:01:19.099260

GreenLancer is providing on-demand engineering services to help solar developers meet upcoming benchmark to take advance of expiring federal tax credits.

As the ITC phase-down deadlines approach, the commercial solar industry is entering a high-stakes period. Under current U.S. Department of Treasury guidance, commercial solar projects must begin construction by July 2026 and be placed in service by December 2027 to qualify for the full 30% Investment Tax Credit.

EPCs and commercial solar installers across the United States are racing to keep projects on schedule while facing permitting bottlenecks, limited engineering bandwidth, and stricter utility interconnection requirements. Missing deadlines can mean losing significant portions of project incentives and profitability.

“EPCs can’t afford to slow down in 2025 or 2026,” said Patrick McCabe, president and COO of GreenLancer. “We’re helping teams scale efficiently by providing the engineering backbone they need to meet federal deadlines.”

Engineering bottleneck in commercial solar permitting

The surge in commercial projects has created a shortage of qualified engineers and drafting capacity. Each state requires solar engineering stamps from a licensed professional engineer, and every AHJ maintains unique standards for commercial solar permitting. Some solar EPCs and regional installers are struggling to meet these requirements quickly enough to stay within ITC eligibility windows.

With more than a decade of experience in solar permit design and engineering, GreenLancer’s digital platform gives EPCs and contractors on-demand access to commercial solar plan sets, electrical drawings, and interconnection documentation tailored to each utility and jurisdiction. Supported by licensed professional engineers in all 50 states and a U.S.-based technical team, GreenLancer helps contractors move seamlessly from design to permission to operate (PTO) — keeping projects compliant and on schedule.

GreenLancer’s services include:

Permit-ready solar design packages for commercial projects

PE-stamped drawings that meet AHJ and utility standards

Utility interconnection documentation

Supporting EPCs amid ITC countdown

Avoiding permitting and interconnection delays directly protects federal tax-credit eligibility. GreenLancer helps EPCs, developers, and installers keep projects moving efficiently — ensuring that design, permitting, and documentation are not the reason an incentive is lost.

EPCs and commercial solar installers can access GreenLancer’s digital engineering platform to request commercial solar plan sets, permit design packages, and PE-stamped drawings for projects in any U.S. jurisdiction. By creating an account at greenlancer.com, users are connected with licensed professional engineers and a U.S.-based support team that delivers code-compliant designs, interconnection documentation, and streamlined commercial solar permitting services, keeping projects on schedule and eligible for federal tax credits.

OECD The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was established to help bridge emerging clean energy technologies from research and development to commercial-scale deployment.","The U.S. Department of Energy has released a new organizational chart that has removed groups focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and reducing carbon emissions.

A new hierarchical chart posted on the DOE website shows that the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management and the Grid Deployment Office are no longer listed as part of the organization. The organizations are now expected to be absorbed by the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore commonsense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a press statement. “These changes will help us better execute the DOE mission of delivering affordable, reliable and secure American energy for the American people.”

EERE

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) was a driving force supporting clean energy advancement by driving down consumer costs and supporting research, development, and deployment.

EERE impact reports said utility-scale solar costs fell by 73%, onshore wind by 41%, and electric vehicle (EV) battery costs dropped by 79% over a decade under its cost-reduction support. The organization estimated it saved Americans an estimated $800 billion in energy costs since 1980.

EERE investments helped support a $2 trillion clean energy market in the U.S. and resulted in nearly 1,000 patents. The organization’s programs helped launch 154 energy innovation companies, creating thousands of jobs and raising billions in private capital, according to a 2024 investment report from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) was instrumental in advancing clean energy, driving down costs for wind and solar power, and supporting innovation in building efficiency and sustainable transportation, while simultaneously bolstering U.S. grid resilience and workforce development.

OECD

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was established to help bridge emerging clean energy technologies from research and development to commercial-scale deployment. It was originally established with a total portfolio of over $25 billion in federal funds allocated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.

OCED selected 113 projects across 42 states, which were designed to unlock billions of dollars in private investment by sharing the initial financial and technical risks associated with new technologies. However, under the Trump administration, DOE announced widespread cancellations of funding, including cutting over $3 billion in May 2025 and over $7 billion in October 2025.

The federal funds were intended to catalyze a much larger amount of private investment. For example, over $14 billion in private capital was tied to the $6 billion federal investment in the Industrial Demonstrations Program alone, much of which has now been lost to Trump administration project cancellations.

Other organizations

Also removed from DOE’s hierarchy is the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), which was tasked with pioneering carbon management systems, including carbon capture and storage, reducing methane emissions, securing critical minerals, and supporting energy and national security measures.

The organization obligated nearly $1.4 billion to fund 654 research and development projects between 2018 to 2023 for projects at industrial facilities and power plants that focused on permanent carbon storage or conversion into valuable products.

FECM also collaborated with the EPA on an $850 million program to help oil and gas operators monitor, measure, and reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.

Also removed from the organization is the Grid Deployment Office (GDO). GDO managed over $14.5 billion in funding and grants to strengthen the U.S. power grid. These included the $10.5 billion Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program and $2.3 billion in formula grants to states and tribes. The programs were planning to add enough transmission lines to support 67 GW of new capacity by 2031.

The office also ran the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits (CITAP) program, which aimed to cut federal transmission permitting times in half. The GDO’s federal investments catalyzed more than $36.9 billion in combined public and private investment, according to a DOE factsheet.

Future funding

Upon the reorganization and funding cuts, non-profit climate policy organization Clean Tomorrow has launched a campaign called Re-Energizing America, a creating a roadmap to address the innovation cliff that will occur when substantial federal funding expires in 2026. The roadmap calls for $25 billion in DOE funding to research, development and deployment programs by 2030. Find the roadmap here.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-24 17:11:10+00:00,The Colorado Sun,Xcel Energy asks for $356M rate increase. Home rates could will rise $10.,"Mark Jaffe, Mark Jaffe Freelance journalist",,,,,https://coloradosun.com/2025/11/24/xcel-energy-electricity-rate-hike-energy-assistance-fee/,"It has been three years since Xcel Energy increased its basic charge for electricity.
Soaring electricity rates were a major issue in the New Jersey and Virginia governors races this month.
Xcel is not alone in its rate increase requests In its rate filing Xcel Energy noted that its request is just one of 57 rate increases being sought by utilities this year nationwide, and in Colorado, United Power, Colorado Springs Utilities and the CORE Electric Cooperative have announced rate increases.
Xcel Energy makes the bulk of its money building infrastructure and adding it to its rate base boosting charges to customers.
Xcel Energy is putting $5 million in corporate money toward the programs (and another $5 million toward helping with gas bills), but the major source of funding will be other Xcel customers as the company proposes doubling the energy assistance charge on bills to about $2.","Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electricity provider with 1.6 million customers, is seeking a 9% increase in rates — about $10 on the average monthly residential bill — even as state regulators voice concerns about affordability.

The utility filed the rate request on Nov. 21 with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, seeking to raise $356 million in additional revenue to recover infrastructure investments, operating costs and lost revenue sources.

It has been three years since Xcel Energy increased its basic charge for electricity.

During that time the company has spent nearly $300 million upgrading the distribution system that serves homes and businesses.

“These investments are aligned with state policy, with our customers, needs and wants and with our own desires to reduce climate change,” said Robert Kenney, the CEO of Xcel Energy’s Colorado subsidiary.

“Every affordability metric that we use will remain below the national and Colorado averages, which has been the case for the last 10 years,” Kenney said.

The company, Kenney said, is also going to expand programs to help low-income and seniors pay their bills.

The proposed rate hike, however, comes at a time that state regulators and consumer advocates are increasingly concerned about the impact of rising electricity rates on household affordability.

“We’re seeing no easing from the pressures in the economy, and yet the company continues to act in a manner that none of these outside forces seem to play into the equation,” said Joseph Pereira, deputy director of the Colorado Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate.

“Bringing these rate cases largely has to do with the returns and dividends it is looking to meet at the corporate level,” Pereira said. The UCA represents residential and small commercial customers in rate cases.

In analysis of Xcel Energy’s plans to invest $22 billion in Colorado over the next five years, PUC Chairperson Eric Blank said rates could rise as much as 72% and that Xcel Energy’s Colorado earnings could rise to $1.6 billion from $700 million in 2020.

The fact that rates remain below the national average — which includes states with very high electricity prices such as Hawaii and California — is of little solace, Blank said.

“Having heard from hundreds or thousands of customers over the course of many rate cases,” Blank said, “my sense is that customers care mainly about what their bills are now and what they’re going to be. So for me, in thinking about and defining affordability, I suppose that we look mainly at growth in average residential rates and bills from today’s level.”

“We may need to explore ways to manage capital spending and rate impact, including in the upcoming rate cases ,” Blank said in remarks at the commissioner’s weekly meeting, two days before Xcel Energy filed for the rate increase.

Mounting electricity prices have been an issue across the country with electricity rates rising twice as fast as inflation since 2022 leaving 1 in 6 families behind on their utility bills, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

Soaring electricity rates were a major issue in the New Jersey and Virginia governors races this month.

“We recognize it’s a highly political issue,” Xcel Energy’s Kenney said.

Xcel is not alone in its rate increase requests

In its rate filing Xcel Energy noted that its request is just one of 57 rate increases being sought by utilities this year nationwide, and in Colorado, United Power, Colorado Springs Utilities and the CORE Electric Cooperative have announced rate increases.

“These filings reflect the same underlying realities that we face — aging systems, rising costs for labor and materials, and evolving reliability and sustainability expectations,” Steven Berman, the utility’s regional vice president of regulatory and pricing, said in PUC testimony.

There are multiple reasons for the surge in rates: the need to update the power grid, the transition from old coal-fired power plants to renewable generation, the growth of natural gas generation and the volatile price of its fuel, and wildfire related costs.

Another spur to rates is the growing demand for electricity from data centers, according to a Bank of America study.

“The pressure on peak electricity demand capacity will likely persist, potentially meaning unyielding pressure on customer utility bills,” the bank study said. “This impacts lower-income households disproportionately and is another headwind at a time of weakening wage growth.”

Driving rates in Colorado are Xcel Energy’s multi-billion plans to expand its system to meet state greenhouse gas reduction goals, deal with wildfire risks and address emerging data center demand.

By the estimate of the PUC’s Blank the 13.82 cent per kilowatt-hour charge in 2024 will rise a minimum of 55% and as much as 72% by 2029. “I’m concerned that we’re fundamentally not on track to maintain affordability,” he said.

The $294 million Xcel is seeking to recoup in investments to the distribution system are part of a five-year, $5 billion plan to overhaul the network that connects homes and business to the grid.

This included replacing nearly 18,000 wooden poles and 18,000 transformers, 775 megawatts of new generation interconnections, 406 new circuit transmission miles and five new substations.

Xcel Energy makes the bulk of its money building infrastructure and adding it to its rate base boosting charges to customers.

“The company’s spending on infrastructure is unchecked and likely not the most efficient or targeted approach,” the UCA’s Pereira said.

Commissioner Megan Gilman said that while the upgrades to the electric system must be made, they have to be optimized and that Xcel Energy’s projections on load growth (how much electricity it needs) and plans to meet have fallen short.

“They have missed the mark in providing load curves and kind of a vision of the grid of the future that really gets to the optimization that is necessary to keep this affordable for customers,” Gilman said.

Rates proposed to increase almost 10%

The proposed rate increase would boost residential bills 9.9% with the average monthly bill for 601 kilowatt-hours rising to $110.04 from $100. In 2022, the average bill was $81.86.

The average small commercial bill would rise about 9.5% to $164.22 from $150 for 1,041 kilowatt-hours. Large commercial and industrial users would see rate increases of 7.3% to 9.3% depending on the amount of electricity consumed.

Even with the rate increase Kenney said that electricity’s share of total spending for a Colorado household would be about 1%, less than half the national average.

“Recognizing the costs can be a challenge for some of our customers, we will expand our electric and gas assistance programs, expanding the number of customers that are eligible to enroll in those programs,” Kenney said.

There are about 60,000 income-qualified customers in the utility’s program, which limits bills to 1.5% of income. The goal is to double the number of participating households, Kenney said. The customers will also avoid involuntary shut offs.

A program for income-qualified seniors could provide a bill credit of up to $20 a month. “So the whole goal with this whole menu of programs is to avoid energy crises,” Kenney said.

Xcel Energy is putting $5 million in corporate money toward the programs (and another $5 million toward helping with gas bills), but the major source of funding will be other Xcel customers as the company proposes doubling the energy assistance charge on bills to about $2.

About half of the average bill is for charges, called riders, above the base rate for things such as clean energy, transmission construction, energy efficiency and wildfire mitigation programs.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/xcel_power_pathways_platteville-JS___0005.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:30.543311

Jeff Hurd is part of a bipartisan quartet of lawmakers trying to extend a tax credit that helps people buy health insurance on the state marketplace.
Hurd said the cost of health care and health insurance premiums is not a Republican or a Democratic issue.
He noted that Republican Senate leaders have promised a vote on an ACA tax credit extension bill by mid-December.
However, the first-term Hurd was a new face when they gathered on the Capitol’s East Steps to unveil the bill last week.
Suozzi, however, is optimistic that the Bipartisan HOPE Act could help pave the way to a solution — especially if lawmakers start hearing from their constituents about it.","GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd is part of a bipartisan quartet of lawmakers trying to extend a tax credit that helps people buy health insurance on the state marketplace. Their proposal focuses on an issue that was at the heart of this fall’s government shutdown.

Hurd said the cost of health care and health insurance premiums is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. “I don’t care how red or blue your district is, this is something that your constituents care about.”

The Bipartisan Healthcare Optimization Protection Extension (HOPE) Act extends the enhanced premium tax credit for two years. It includes a lower income cap for enrollees, about $200,000 for a family of four, and phases out for those making above that (currently the subsidy is capped based on what percent of a family’s income it spends on health care). The bill would also try to crack down on fraud.

Backers describe the bill as a needed stopgap measure.

“We don't want to see premiums skyrocket, but we probably need a deeper plan for the longer term to deal with the high cost of healthcare,” said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, the other GOP lead on the bill. “What we're proposing is a bridge. Let's help keep people's premiums down — that's important — and it’ll give us time to work on it, maybe something better over the next year or two.”

“People are freaking out. I mean, I get phone calls from people about seeing their premiums go up by a thousand dollars a month.,” said Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, one of the Democratic leads.

He noted that Republican Senate leaders have promised a vote on an ACA tax credit extension bill by mid-December. But that’s not guaranteed in the House. “That's why we felt it was very important for us to get together as a bipartisan team to say, let's work together and let's force something to happen here that we can try and build consensus on.”

All four sponsors of the Bipartisan HOPE Act are also co-sponsors of a separate bill that would extend the credit for one year in its current form. They said their bill was developed from other lawmakers’’ response to that effort.

“Some of the feedback that we got from that was, listen, it's not long enough. There are some reforms that we need to be making,” Hurd explained, adding that this new bill “addresses those concerns that we've heard from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.”

Hurd enters the ACA fray

It’s not unusual for Bacon, Suozzi or the Bipartisan HOPE Act’s fourth sponsor, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, to be found standing in front of a half dozen cameras at the U.S. Capitol. These three have been in Congress since 2019 and as members of the Problem Solvers Caucus have been part of other bipartisan policy plans enacted into law.

However, the first-term Hurd was a new face when they gathered on the Capitol’s East Steps to unveil the bill last week.

Bacon introduced Hurd to the crowd of reporters personally. “He’s a great new freshman doing wonderful things for our House.”

Suozzi praised Hurd, also a member of the Problem Solvers, as the “new guy in Congress from Colorado who just really wants to do the right thing and is stepping out along with everyone else here to say we’re planting this flag. We’re trying to get something done.”

There is some potential risk for Hurd here; he’s advocating for a bill that President Donald Trump does not currently support. Even House leadership has been skeptical of extending the credit.

Still, there is a strong incentive for Hurd to act. His district is seeing some of the highest increases in ACA premiums across the state.

According to a new survey from the Colorado Polling Institute, 3 out 4 Coloradans think Congress should extend the enhanced tax credit and a majority of those polled believe the cost of health insurance in Colorado is a crisis or a major problem.

But there are also limits to how far out on a limb the Western Slope Republican will go. Hurd said he would not support a discharge petition to get the bill to the floor. If it gets enough signatures, a discharge petition allows lawmakers to bypass leadership and bring a bill that has a majority of support in the full chamber to a vote.

The unusual procedure recently succeeded in forcing a vote on releasing the Epstein files.

“I think regular order is the right way to do this,” said Hurd. “We’re giving Congress and our colleagues in the Senate a serious, incredible proposal. I think it's really good and I think it reflects a consensus that is sound public policy.”

Some lawmakers are willing to consider it.

“I’m always willing to have a conversation about what a bipartisan path forward could look like,” said Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who said she’s looking into the details of the Bipartisan HOPE Act and is also in the Problem Solvers Caucus. “Doing something to address the skyrocketing costs is significantly better than what is currently happening to Americans.”

Still this bill faces an uphill climb in Congress.

GOP Rep. Gabe Evans said people in his district are worried about the affordability of healthcare, but is concerned the income cap is too generous.

“I've talked to folks that have said, ‘why should I, as somebody that's making $50, $60, $70,000 a year, have to subsidize somebody who's making $200,000 a year, $300,000 a year?” he said.

Evans, who is also in the Problem Solvers, said talking about income caps and dealing with waste and abuse in the system are conversations that need to happen.

Suozzi, however, is optimistic that the Bipartisan HOPE Act could help pave the way to a solution — especially if lawmakers start hearing from their constituents about it.

The United States won’t have much to offer officially — the Trump administration had said it wouldn’t send any high-level delegates. And with President Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement earlier this year, the country is far from a climate leader these days.

But all is not lost. Local level climate work continues in the United States, with accomplishments worth cheering — and replicating. For the last few years, I’ve tracked one of the most overlooked: the removal of harmful and obsolete dams. The United States has been leading the global charge on dam removals. In just the last 25 years nearly 2,000 dams have been blasted and backhoed from our rivers and streams.

Dam removals, like the four-dam effort completed last year on the Klamath River, are often celebrated for helping imperiled fish, like salmon. But they also offer two important benefits for the climate.

The first is reducing emissions. A growing body of scientific research dating back to the 1990s has found that reservoirs from dams can produce greenhouse gas emissions, some on par with thermal power plants. The biggest culprit is methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps 80 times more heat as carbon dioxide over 20 years. As organic material breaks down in a reservoir, methane is diffused from the water into the air.

As we take stock of our greenhouse gas emissions, an honest accounting of the input from dams could help us make reductions where dams are unneeded, unsafe, or doing more harm than good. In some states there are thousands of “deadbeat” dams, which serve no purpose at all anymore, and should be put on the chopping block. And if you’re wondering if it makes sense to remove infrastructure that can produce “clean” energy, know that the vast majority of large U.S. dams — upwards of 97 percent — don’t produce power.

The second is strengthening resilience. Many dams are outdated, dilapidated, or not designed to handle the onslaught of water that comes with climate-amplified storms. Some have already failed, risking lives and costing millions. After Hurricane Helene slammed North Carolina last year, 40 dams were damaged or destroyed. Expect to see more of that. A recent report from researchers at Utah State University found that incidents of dam failures or interventions needed to prevent failures are skyrocketing. From 1990 to 1999 we averaged two such incidents a year. That number jumped to an average of 50 a year from 2020 to 2023.

After two years of dangerous floods, Vermont has gotten the message. Last year the state passed a law to identify dams that worsen flooding and create a fund to remove them. Other states are also assessing dam removal to boost climate resilience. Removing damaging dams and helping rivers reconnect with their floodplains can help protect communities from severe weather and save money.

Dam removals offer other climate resilience benefits. Dams hold back water, but they also block the movement of sediment, which depletes coastal beaches and speeds erosion. One of the most notorious examples is the Matilija Dam near Ojai, California, a now-defunct dam that has corralled nearly 9 million cubic yards of sediment. Removing Matilija would reinvigorate downstream beaches in Ventura. As rising seas eat away at ocean beaches, upstream dam removals can help protect coastal communities.

Dams also change the temperature of rivers. As climate change pushes up the mercury, some reservoirs are becoming more like bathtubs. Higher water temperatures can foster toxic algal blooms that threaten human health and kill wildlife. Dam removals can flip the script, helping to restore more natural stream temperatures and flows, improving water quality in rivers that millions of Americans rely on for drinking water. It can also support biodiversity by enabling aquatic animals to find cooler upstream waters to better weather our changing climate.

Dam removals aren’t a climate cure-all, but the magnitude of the crisis we face will require all the tools we can muster — and master. Several decades of dam removals across the U.S. has proved they work to restore rivers better and faster than anything else. Now let’s put them to use for climate action, too.

As plans for natural gas pipeline expansions in southwest Virginia are rapidly taking shape, proposals from two major energy firms to transport gas through the Appalachian regions of Virginia and North Carolina are fueling community concern.

Critics are disturbed by the route of the two proposed pipelines, now under review amid a surge of applications to build massive data centers in the region. Among their concerns: the lines, and compressor stations related to gas distribution, will be laid within hundreds of feet of each other in some locations in a North Carolina county and potentially disrupt rural lifestyles and landscapes.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Virginia environmental regulators are reviewing long-running requests from Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC and the Williams Companies Inc. for billion-dollar extensions that would link to pivotal and existing crosscountry networks.

Mountain Valley Pipeline is seeking to build 31 miles of pipeline from Virginia into North Carolina, extending a 303-mile network that now cuts from the Marcellus and Utica shale along the Pennsylvania border through West Virginia to southern Virginia. MVP’s proposal, called the Southgate Extension, has been reviewed and revised since 2020. Mountain Valley is also requesting to add compressor stations along its main line: three in West Virginia and one in Montgomery County, Virginia, about 70 miles near where Southgate would begin.

The Williams Companies is requesting approval to build 55 new miles of pipeline to bolster its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, better known as Transco, that transports fracked gas from the Texas Gulf Coast across about a dozen states. The Williams Companies calls its proposal the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, or the SSEP, a pipeline that will expand capacity for Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and other states.

A FERC decision is expected for Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is operated by EQT Corp., by the end of the year. FERC is expected to review the proposal by The Williams Companies, based in Oklahoma, by February.

The Williams Companies also recently submitted a separate proposal for a pipeline expansion in Virginia, a plan that emerged in May during a quarterly earnings call. The Williams Companies said it was aiming to run pipe from Southern Virginia to “serve the power-hungry Virginia market” with a northern extension, dubbed the Power Express, and later told the Cardinal News website that the project was “in the early development stage.”

The rush for more reliance on gas is likely to gain pace.

The Virginia Department of Energy announced just weeks ago a partnership with the Williams Companies as well as Red Post Energy LLC, whose parent company is based in Australia, and Enbridge Inc., headquartered in Canada. The initiative will study new natural gas infrastructure proposals for “locations between Roanoke and Bristol,” according to a department release on Oct. 9.

The study “will evaluate site suitability, environmental considerations, interconnection requirements, and economic benefits including job creation, tax revenue, and regional development opportunities,” the department said. The release offered no deadline for the study’s completion.

All these proposals would thread miles more natural gas pipeline in a state that is seen as a hot property for companies seeking data centers as part of their growth strategy.

Those proposals are being considered as Virginia oversees other new operations coming on line. TC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, is set this month to launch a pipeline, nearly 49 miles in length, near the Tidewater region. The Virginia Natural Gas local distribution company is also seeking by October 2027 to expand a compressor station in the city of Chesapeake, in southeastern Virginia, to boost smaller intrastate pipelines.

But some communities are raising concerns about the speed and breadth of many of these proposals—and they are complaining that towns and residents are having a difficult time sorting through the construction requests and possible risks.

Community advocates, in both states, said they want to know how regulators and towns are supposed to assess cumulative impacts and allow for proper public involvement in the process.

“How confusing and complicated,” Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator with Appalachian Voices, an environmental nonprofit advocacy group based in North Carolina, said about the pipeline proposals and FERC’s analysis of the projects.

Data center proposals, tied to artificial intelligence work sought by technology and financial companies, are changing the landscape of some swaths of rural America. Virginia alone could see electricity demands triple by 2040 because of data center growth. The state, home to several federal agencies, has been keen to accommodate business interests tied to AI.

The Virginia General Assembly’s policy research unit has estimated that a new 1.5 gigawatt gas plant, enough to power about 375,000 homes, would need to be built every 18 months for 15 consecutive years as part of the energy mix needed if all the data center proposals become reality.

The expansion of natural gas is among the priorities of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump is a proponent of fossil fuels and early in his second term he issued an executive order “Unleashing American Energy.” Trump declared a widely disputed national energy emergency, which some companies such as Mountain Valley Pipeline have used to support pipeline expansion proposals.

Mountain Valley spokesperson Shawn Day said the company’s main line, a 303-mile project running from Northwest West Virginia into Pittsylvania County completed in 2024, ensured reliability. Day pointed to an April 2025 report by FERC and the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability Corporation, another regulatory group, that “credited MVP with helping to avoid” gas shortages “during extreme weather and periods of record demand early this year.”

“Opponents of the MVP Mainline claimed for years that the (main line) project wasn’t needed, and yet barely six months after it entered operation, the project was operating at its full capacity, providing a critical supply of natural gas for residential and business use and electricity generation,” Day said in an email. The Southgate extension will prove to be as useful if not critical for the region, MVP contends in its proposal.

The Williams Companies also focused on rising needs in its application for expansion. In an email to Inside Climate News, it described the SSEP as a “$1.2 billion investment that will strengthen energy reliability and deliver meaningful economic benefits across the region.”

SSEP “will meet or exceed all safety and environmental standards, while supporting climate and energy goals,” the Williams Companies statement said. “Assertions to the contrary misrepresent both the facts and our record of responsible development.”

That is not how some community groups—critical of coal mining in the region and fearful of the rapid demand of pipelines across the countryside—view the energy companies’ ambitions and regard for local residents. They fear that the development will harm their way of life.

“It all comes down to there has not been any transparency, any real data showing a need for all of this coming through here,” said Tiffany Haworth, executive director of the nonprofit Dan River Basin Association, who also questioned whether all the data centers will be built. There is a risk that energy companies are predicting and producing for a market that may not exist—and communities may suffer, she said.

“People want to turn their lights on. … We get that. But we already have a pipeline going through there,” Haworth said. “We as an organization don’t feel that the harm that it is going to cause to our waterways and our recreational outdoor recreational economy—over a million people get their drinking water from these rivers—makes sense.”

Kasey Kinsella, associate director of 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous advocacy group that opposes the pipelines, said the companies’ plans, if completed, would destroy any chance of natural harmony.

“All of this is just so absurd,” Kinsella said.

Southgate in Virginia

Big energy companies and their related businesses have been eager to provide services in some of the fastest-growing states. Mountain Valley Pipeline and the Williams Companies have both focused on a North Carolina location—Rockingham County, population 91,000—as the choice for their expansion ambitions.

Mountain Valley Pipeline, operating in Virginia since 2014, first proposed the Southgate Extension in 2018 as a pipeline to extend from its main line, starting in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and running 31 miles deep into north central North Carolina. That extension was approved in 2020 by FERC—but on the condition that the main line received its necessary approvals.

The main line construction faced several legal disputes for nearly a decade. In 2023, MVP benefited from congressional pressure orchestrated by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin pushed its permit through during the federal budget process then. By June 2024, the main line was operating.

The Southgate proposal, too, has faced some trouble from regulators. The Virginia Air Pollution Control Board in 2021 reviewed and rejected MVP’s permit request for Southgate based on health concerns. The board found the pipeline path would cause potentially disproportionate harm to Black residential areas.

In late 2023, months after the main line approval, MVP revised its Southgate plan with some major changes.

MVP’s proposed new Southgate would traverse 31 miles rather than 75 miles–and ends at a different place. MVP’s previous Southgate proposal had terminated in Alamance County in North Carolina; the new plan will end in nearby Rockingham County.

FERC in 2024 released an environmental assessment, that the amended project “would result in fewer environmental effects than the” original MVP plan. It “would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” although there would be some impacts to prime farmland, forested areas and wetlands, FERC said.

FERC notably found that the Southgate proposal would not be likely to “adversely affect” federally endangered animals in the area, including the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat. The project, FERC also said, would “not result in significant effects,” on state-listed species, including the bigeye jumprock, which the Virginia Department of Wildlife has designated as having “high conservation need.”

FERC also found that MVP’s proposed method of horizontal directional drilling, or boring that goes under streams instead of digging ditches across them, would avoid environmental harm. Horizontal drilling “greatly reduces potential effects on surface waterbodies, particularly compared to open-cut crossings. In general, typical pipeline effects on waterbodies are avoided with trenchless methods,” FERC said in its 2024 assessment.

Williams Companies’s Plan

The Williams Companies’s SSEP is also proposed to run from Pittsylvania County in Virginia and end in Rockingham County. The Williams Companies aims to build two loops of pipeline–a 31-mile section crossing the Virginia and North Carolina border is called the “Eden Loop” and a 24.2-mile stretch in North Carolina is dubbed the “Salem Loop.” Both would link to its pipeline running from Texas.

In an environmental assessment report in 2024, FERC reviewed Williams Companies’s plan and found no “significant impact” to the “quality of human environment. The effect on “vegetation would be minor and mostly temporary to short term,” and “effects on wildlife from construction and operation of the Project would not be significant,” according to the FERC report.

FERC also assessed the cumulative impacts of both MVP’s Southgate and The Williams Companies’s SSEP proposal based on a myriad of aspects, including wetlands. MVP’s proposal would affect 18.2 acres of wetlands during construction, it said, and the Williams Companies’ Eden Loop would affect 27.5 acres of wetlands.

Because of the overlapping construction area and timetable of the projects, “cumulative effects on surface water quality may occur,” FERC said. It noted that “The magnitude of effects would depend on the specific timeframe of crossing the same waterbodies.”

Sims of Appalachian Voices said FERC did not go far enough in looking at the double whammy of two pipeline projects—with trucks, traffic and construction—converging on Rockingham County. “I’m not sure how anyone could look at that much information and come to that conclusion,” Sims said of FERC’s report.

Sims said having the two projects, which could be as close as within 200 feet of each other in some areas of the criss-crossing routes, could be problematic if there were structural failures in either network. She questioned how regulators would track which company was responsible for erosion and sediment problems that could choke flora and fauna.

“If you have projects that are so closely routed with construction at the same time, the blame–if there are sedimentation problems–it’s even more complicated,” Sims said.

Broader Community Concerns

Haworth of The Dan River Basin Association, based in North Carolina, said she and others are concerned that MVP’s and the Williams Companies’s projects will upend years of work to protect the environment and the river that flows through eight counties in Virginia and North Carolina.

The river basin, a 3,300 square mile watershed, is fed by the Smith, Mayo, Banister, Hayco and Sandy rivers. The waterways have weathered troubling industrial demands before, she said, and residents across state borders have some vivid memories of a time when textiles dominated the economic and environmental landscape.

The dye from a factory in Martinsville, Virginia, would flow into the Smith River and change the color of the stream ”running down all the way down into North Carolina,” Haworth said. In 2014, one of Duke Energy Corp.’s steam stations in Eden, North Carolina, sprung a leak, leading the U.S. Department of Interior to find that approximately 39,000 tons of ash and 27 million gallons of ash pond water” were released and resulted in a threat to endangered species and migratory birds.

“We’ve worked really hard for two decades, working with municipalities and state government, to make sure that these natural resources remain protected, preserved for future generations, and pipelines do not quite fit into that,” Haworth said.

Haworth wondered how FERC could find “no significant impact” on the quality of life for people who will live near miles of heavy construction. “When they say minimal impact, no amount of impact is worth hurting people. A million people’s drinking water,” she said.

Kinsella of the advocacy group 7 Directions of Service said she is concerned about every part of the expansion. No one should overlook, she said, the impact of compressors along the pipeline trail. They too will add noise and stress, she said, particularly so to neighborhoods that have historically been burdened with industrial pressures.

The energy companies may try to monetarily compensate the residents with onetime financial checks but that won’t really address how their lives will be changed, she said.

“What will the cost be when there are health impacts from an expanded compressor station?” Kinsella said. “My heart goes out to these working class folks along the main line route who, their land, their water, their livelihood, psychologically, has been just so beat up over the past 10 years in this fight.”

FERC is expected to make a decision on Southgate by the end of the year. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) also is undergoing a water protection permit process that will assess streams and wetland impacts. A public hearing for the permit is scheduled Thursday night and a decision is expected Dec. 8.

Melanie Davenport, director of DEQ’s cross-media programs, said the agency has requested erosion and sediment stormwater protection plans, which would prevent loose dirt from washing into waterways.

FERC is expected to decide SSEP by February. Virginia DEQ’s also is reviewing and will have to approve two water quality permits for the project.

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, which is also reviewing the proposals, recently approved a permit for Mountain Valley Pipeline for the Southgate Extension but the project cannot move forward without FERC approval.",https://cardinalpine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/1-6.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 14:01:39.566593

On behalf of Clean Wisconsin and the Natural Resources Defense Council, nonprofit environmental law firm Earthjustice filed a lawsuit against federal energy regulators on Tuesday. The Sierra Club is representing itself in the case.

In their petition for review, the groups asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review a pair of orders that federal regulators issued earlier this year.

One order approved a plan by the Midwest grid operator — the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO — to expedite connecting new power plants to the Midwest grid. The other denied a rehearing on the plan.

When it was approved by federal regulators, MISO said the Expedited Resource Addition Study, or ERAS, process was designed to bring urgently needed generation resources online quickly in the face of “unprecedented” demand growth and increasing reliability challenges.

A spokesperson for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, declined to comment, saying the agency cannot discuss court proceedings.

In a statement, a spokesperson for MISO said the grid operator is aware of the suit and will continue to monitor court proceedings.

Environmental groups argue MISO’s fast-tracking process prioritizes fossil fuels over clean energy projects.

In a statement, Earthjustice attorney Ada Statler said federal regulators are letting grid operators, like MISO, “rewrite the rule book to the benefit of fossil fuel and data center companies.”

“FERC is sidelining cheaper clean energy projects, and allowing utilities to pass on the higher costs of methane gas to other customers, despite its legal mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates,” Statler stated.

Ciaran Gallagher, energy and air manager at Clean Wisconsin, said some clean energy projects have been waiting five years to be studied for connection by the grid operator, while the projects selected for the fast-track program get to essentially “skip the line.”

In September, MISO announced the first 10 projects selected for the ERAS program, which will eventually have a total of 68 projects. They included five natural gas plants, three solar projects, one wind and one battery project, accounting for 5.3 gigawatts.

Although the first round was evenly split between gas and renewable projects, Gallagher said natural gas will contribute far more megawatts to the grid than renewables.

The five renewable projects would account for about 974 megawatts. The natural gas projects accounted for about 4,300 megawatts, or about 4.3 gigawatts. For context, 1 gigawatt is enough to power 100 million LED lightbulbs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“At the end of the day, there is going to be considerably more gas added to our grid because of this process,” Gallagher said.

Utilities have said natural gas is critical for meeting spiking energy demand from data centers and other industrial development.

One of the first 10 projects selected is the Red Oak Ridge Energy Center, a more than 1-gigawatt natural gas plant proposed in the town of Paris in Kenosha County.

The developer behind the project is seeking approval from the state Public Service Commission to build the plant. Earlier this year, the developer said MISO’s fast-tracked interconnection process would not affect the timeline for state-level approval.

We Energies, the state’s largest electric utility, also applied for state approval to purchase the project from developer Invenergy, as part of a plan to add nearly 3 gigawatts of capacity to the grid in response to rising energy demand from data centers. That plan also included seven solar projects.

Gallagher said utilities are “doubling down” on natural gas instead of focusing on energy sources that don’t produce carbon emissions.

Federal and state agencies often conduct parallel reviews covering the same issues, generating thousands of pages while adding little new information.
We could establish a single coordinated review process led by one federal agency rather than forcing projects through redundant, parallel tracks.","A sentiment I consistently hear from constituents is that they no longer believe in government’s ability to do big things — not just to stake out bold ideas but to implement and deliver on them. On the major issues we face, from housing to energy production, there is growing consensus that we lack the ability to move quickly and at the scale needed to address the problems before us. They are not wrong.

In my district in California’s Central Valley, we see the need for massive investments in new water infrastructure to meet the needs of our growers and disadvantaged communities, yet we seem incapable of moving beyond the endless planning and discussion phases.

This was not always the case. The Central Valley as it exists today was built on a series of ambitious federal and state infrastructure projects that transformed the way water is transported throughout the state. Take, for instance, the C.W. Bill Jones Pumping Plant — a cornerstone of the Central Valley Project — which lifts water into the Delta-Mendota Canal and delivers roughly 3 million acre-feet of water each year to 32 water districts through a 117-mile aqueduct. Planning and construction for both the canal and the pumping plant began in 1947, and the system was operational just four years later.

A project like that today would struggle even to enter its initial planning phase within four years. A clear example is the Los Banos Creek Detention Project in western Merced County, a proposal to modernize an existing reservoir in my district that was originally built in the 1960s for flood control. The effort would expand its use to include active water storage, groundwater recharge, and conveyance — strengthening water reliability for farms, wildlife refuges, and disadvantaged communities while reducing flood risk. Supported by local water districts and federal partners alike, it is exactly the kind of practical, multi-benefit investment we should be able to deliver quickly.

But instead of being fast-tracked, the project, first proposed in 2012, has since wound its way through separate approval processes at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, California Department of Water Resources and State Water Resources Control Board. This was in addition to rounds of state and federal conceptual, environmental, operational, and design reviews, as well as countless public hearings and other procedural hurdles.

All of this is required, even though the project simply improves operations at an existing facility. I am encouraged that construction has now started — but a non-controversial project that will take only six months to build shouldn’t require more than ten years of paperwork and red tape just to get shovels into the ground.

When I talk to colleagues in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, I hear the same stories about infrastructure projects in their districts that are desperately needed but cannot seem to move forward. This is a problem of our own making, and it is within our capacity to fix it.

There are market forces at play, such as high interest rates and rising construction costs, but there are also countless ways government has made it harder to get projects approved and easier for them to get delayed or stuck in an endless cycle of review. These delays not only create uncertainty and lengthen the time it takes for projects to get built, but also add significant costs that make them either unnecessarily expensive or so prohibitively costly that they never get built.

I’m ready to work across the aisle to pass reforms that maintain essential safety and environmental protections while bringing predictability and speed to the process. The stakes are not theoretical for my constituents. California’s climate is delivering longer dry spells, bigger storms and earlier snowmelt.

Increased regulations are reducing water allocations and creating uncertainty for growers and communities alike. That volatility demands smarter conveyance, more groundwater recharge, and modernized storage. Instead, projects spend decade after decade in paperwork purgatory while families, farms, wildlife, and communities pay the price for inaction.

The core problem is process, not protection. Federal and state agencies often conduct parallel reviews covering the same issues, generating thousands of pages while adding little new information. Timelines stretch, costs soar, and opponents learn to “litigate the clock,” betting that delay will kill the project. Meanwhile, the environment doesn’t get healthier, and communities don’t get water security.

We can do better. A bipartisan effort to modernize our permitting system could restore both efficiency and trust. We could set clear, enforceable timelines for environmental review and permits — measured in months, not decades. We could establish a single coordinated review process led by one federal agency rather than forcing projects through redundant, parallel tracks. We could maintain strong oversight while placing reasonable limits on the timeframes and scope of legal challenges, so delay is no longer a tool for obstruction. And we could invest in the people and technology agencies need to meet these goals — digital permitting systems, expanded staff capacity, and modern tools that improve transparency and accountability.

Americans are losing faith in their government’s ability to take on big challenges and deliver real results, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Reforming how we build is one of the few areas where both parties already agree on the problem and the solution. By working together to fix our processes, we can save taxpayer dollars, strengthen our economy, and once again show that America can build great things for its people.

The overall package was largely seen as incremental at best and far less than is needed to tackle the accelerating climate crisis.
The EU stood united, fighting for ambition on climate action,” he posted on X, even though that unity was sorely tested.
“Despite being referred to as an Indigenous Cop … it became clear that Indigenous peoples continue to be excluded from the negotiations,” said Emil Gualinga, of the Kichwa Peoples of Sarayaku, Ecuador.","The world is not winning the fight against the climate crisis but it is still in that fight, the UN climate chief has said in Belém, Brazil, after a bitterly contested Cop30 reached a deal.

Countries at Cop30 failed to bring the curtain down on the fossil fuel age amid opposition from some countries led by Saudi Arabia, and they underdelivered on a flagship hope – at a conference held in the Amazon – to chart an end to deforestation.

But in a fractious era of nationalism, war and distrust, the talks did not collapse as was feared. Multilateralism held – just.

“We knew this Cop would take place in stormy political waters,” said Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, after a long and occasionally angry final plenary at the climate summit. “Denial, division and geopolitics has dealt international cooperation some heavy blows this year.”

But Cop30 showed that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking”, Stiell added, making an oblique reference to the US, which under Donald Trump opted not to send anyone to Belém. Trump, who has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and a “con job” has come to embody the opposition to progress on dealing with dangerous global heating.

Stiell said: “I’m not saying we’re winning the climate fight. But we are undeniably still in it, and we are fighting back. Here in Belém, nations chose unity, science and economic common sense. This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back. But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity – rock solid in support of climate cooperation.”

He pointed to one section of the Cop30 agreement: “The global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.” He argued: “This is a political and market signal that cannot be ignored.”

The summit began more than a fortnight ago with the leaders’ summit. The Brazilian hosts promised with early sunny optimism that it would finish on time, but as the negotiations went on the confusion and obvious divisions between parties grew, and the process looked close to collapse on Friday.

Overnight negotiations and compromise on all sides meant a deal could be agreed on Saturday. The summit produced decisions on dozens of issues, including a promise to triple adaptation funding to protect communities against climate impacts, an agreement for a just transition mechanism (JTM) and recognition of the rights of Indigenous people.

However, proposals to start planning roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and end deforestation were not agreed and were hived off to processes outside the UN to be pushed forward by coalitions of willing nations. The impacts of the food system – such as cattle in cleared tracts in the Amazon – were largely ignored.

The overall package was largely seen as incremental at best and far less than is needed to tackle the accelerating climate crisis. Jasper Inventor, a deputy programme director at Greenpeace International, said: “Cop30 started with a bang of ambition but ended with a whimper of disappointment. This was the moment to move from negotiations to implementation – and it slipped.”

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said progress was made but warned it was becoming more difficult to secure agreements. “Cops are consensus-based – and in a period of geopolitical divides, consensus is ever harder to reach,” he said. “I cannot pretend that Cop30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

The EU commissioner for the environment, Wopke Hoekstra, echoed the sense of relief. “It is not perfect, but it is a huge step in the right direction. The EU stood united, fighting for ambition on climate action,” he posted on X, even though that unity was sorely tested.

Anna Åberg, of the thinktank Chatham House, said just reaching a deal was positive. “A ‘Cop collapse’ would have been a big and harmful blow at the end of a year already marked by serious challenges for international climate cooperation and multilateralism more broadly,” she said. “It is positive that a deal was reached in Belém, even if many will – legitimately – be disappointed with the level of ambition.”

But there was also deep frustration that although adaptation finance had been promised, the deadline had been pushed back to 2035. Mamadou Ndong Toure, the thematic lead for climate and resilience at Practical Action in Senegal, said: “Adaptation cannot be built on shrinking commitments; people on the frontline need predictable, accountable support and a clear path to act.”

Similarly, although Brazil styled Cop30 as the “Indigenous Cop” and the deal recognised for the first time Indigenous people’s land rights and knowledge as a fundamental climate solution, there were still concerns that participation was limited. “Despite being referred to as an Indigenous Cop … it became clear that Indigenous peoples continue to be excluded from the negotiations,” said Emil Gualinga, of the Kichwa Peoples of Sarayaku, Ecuador.

And there was frustration that the final text did not refer directly to fossil fuels. James Dyke, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, said: “Despite the host’s best efforts, Cop30 will not even be able to get nations to agree to fossil fuel phase-out. This shameful outcome is the result of narrow self-interest and cynical politicking.”

After several years of these annual UN climate gatherings being held in authoritarian-led countries, there were bursts of colourful protest in Belém as civil society returned in force. A march with tens of thousands of protesters lit up the middle Saturday of the summit and activists made their voices heard in an otherwise, grey, sterile conference centre.

“From Indigenous-led demonstrations at the venue to the more than 70,000 people who marched in the streets, there was a palpable sense of momentum that I haven’t felt for years,” said Jamie Henn, the director of Fossil Free Media.

At least a path ahead remains, watchers concluded. Prof Michael Grubb, of University College London, said: “The damp squib of an outcome from Cop30 has underlined that a focus on the negative – phasing out of fossil fuels – is fraught with political obstacles. For the road to Cop31, the focus must be balanced by equal attention to the positive – the huge economic potential of accelerating the energy transition, and ways to help countries around the world benefit from renewables and electrification.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66352c368f7781afabd57a57e70f6a73fbe8c8d/819_0_4221_3377/master/4221.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=583bbbdf7dd4fa51edca3492063de7b3",N,,2025-11-24 15:01:55.427276

Overturning the Endangerment Finding and the motor vehicle standards would put millions of people in harm’s way.","You may have seen the new study by the National Bureau of Economic Research – or, more likely, the New York Times story about it – that shows American homeowners are facing substantial and rapidly-rising home insurance premiums due to harms from climate-fueled extreme weather events.

The New York Times story, which includes state-by-state analysis, finds that rising premiums are placing severe financial burdens on Americans – doubling home insurance costs in some areas over the last several years, lowering home values by tens of thousands of dollars, and making it impossible for some Americans to purchase insurance at all.

This new reporting adds to a large and growing body of evidence showing that climate change is straining insurance, housing, and banking systems, and in turn posing financial risks to communities across the country.

At the same time Americans are facing these extensive and rising costs, the Trump administration has proposed to rescind EPA’s foundational Endangerment Finding – the bedrock determination that climate pollution harms public health and welfare – along with all of the climate pollution standards for motor vehicles that EPA has ever adopted. These reckless and deeply damaging actions will mean more pollution that is fueling extreme weather events, and thus even higher costs for Americans who are already facing runaway increases in home insurance premiums.

More pollution, more harm, higher costs

EDF’s analysis found that the Trump EPA’s proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding and motor vehicle standards would result in as much as 18 billion more tons of climate-altering pollution as the cumulative emissions released mount over time. That’s the equivalent of three times the annual U.S. emissions today and would impose up to $3.9 trillion in climate harms on society.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans filed comments with EPA expressing strong opposition to the administration’s proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding and the motor vehicle standards. Many of those comments underscored how it would only worsen the already high costs they are now suffering — including by raising insurance premiums.

Local, state, and federal elected representatives echoed their constituents’ concerns:

The S. Conference of Mayors and National League of Cities described how the extreme weather events are pushing up insurance premiums and contributing to falling home values.

The Mayor of Tacoma, Washington stated, “[the administration’s proposal] would lead to higher property and health insurance premiums that endanger the financial stability and health of families working day in and day out to achieve better outcomes.”

Eight members of Florida’s Congressional delegation similarly stated, “Thousands of Florida homeowners have seen their premiums double or triple in recent years. Climate risk is driving insurance companies to raise rates or withdraw from the state entirely – seven Florida insurers became insolvent between January 2022 and February 2023, disproportionately harming homeowners who are already struggling to make ends meet.”

The administration’s proposal will impose other significant costs on Americans

Rising insurance premiums and other extensive costs from climate-fueled extreme weather events are just one of the ways the administration’s proposal will make life more expensive for Americans.

It will also:

Raise gas prices – The Trump administration’s own analysis shows that the proposal will make gas more expensive, increasing gas prices by 25 cents per gallon in 2035 and 76 cents per gallon in 2050. The proposal will force Americans to spend up to $1.7 trillion more on gas.

Result in job losses: The administration’s Annual Energy Outlook analysis shows that repealing the Endangerment Finding and vehicle standards will cost 450,000 jobs across the nation by 2035. Those job losses have already begun to materialize as the administration has increased its attacks on clean energy and clean vehicles. EDF released a report last week documenting $25 billion in cancelled clean energy manufacturing investments thus far in 2025, with a loss of more than 34,000 anticipated jobs. In October alone, $3.9 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects were canceled and 6,700 anticipated jobs were lost.

Increase air pollution, harming health: The administration’s proposal would increase smog and soot-forming pollution that would lead to as many as 77,000 early deaths and 52 million more asthma attacks — health harms that would cost the nation as much as $260 billion.

If Trump EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin moves forward with this dangerous action, it would put more deadly pollution in our air and hit Americans in their pocketbooks with higher insurance, gas and healthcare costs.

On Dec. 1, the workgroup will send its recommendations to Ferguson’s office, with one omission that has some conservationists concerned.

Data centers in Washington use sales-and-use tax breaks designed to incentivize companies to build in communities that could use an economic boost. Some on the workgroup wanted to make those requirements contingent on data center companies coming up with their own sources of clean power. The recommendation would also extend the tax break to data centers built across all of Washington.

The workgroup will not include the clean energy recommendation in its final report, a development first reported by Columbia Insight and confirmed by group member Zachariah Baker, policy director for NW Energy Coalition.

It’s the only one of the nine draft recommendations that won’t make the final cut. Baker wanted to see the clean energy generation requirement included in the final report, but ultimately voted against the recommendation because it is coupled with extending the tax breaks statewide.

RELATED: Washington's hydropower has created a data center boom. Some are concerned about its future

“Our perspective is that if there are going to be tax incentives, then there should be more requirements to try to move the data centers to a higher standard — encourage them to move towards a gold standard that would both protect the environment and protect communities,” Baker said.

That doesn’t mean data centers will have carte blanche to run on carbon power sources. The workgroup is still recommending data centers comply with Washington’s environmental laws, including one that requires all electricity generation in Washington state to be free of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. But many are concerned those goals are unrealistic given the current pace of data center construction, and the massive energy it takes to run the facilities.

State law is also less clear on whether data centers can run on fossil fuels if they build their own plants instead of getting power from the grid. Some data center companies have signaled an interest in building their own natural gas plants. The NW Energy Coalition wants the state to clarify the rules.

RELATED: Data centers are booming. But there are big energy and environmental risks

“That was really important to us because of the energy demand that these data centers require,” Baker said. “They require massive amounts of energy, and if they're not using clean energy from the start and as soon as possible, that can threaten our ability to be able to meet our state's climate and clean energy goals if they're relying on fossil fuels instead of clean energy.”

Data centers and chip fabrication — both essential to AI — are expected to add anywhere from 2,200 to 4,800 average megawatts of electricity load across the Pacific Northwest by 2030, according to a report to the Washington Department of Revenue. Electric cars and home appliances are expected to add additional strain on the grid, too.

“ Just to put those numbers in context the city of Seattle uses about a thousand average megawatts to power Seattle,” Baker said. “So you're talking about two to four new potential Seattles by 2030.”

Baker hopes the recommendations will inform rule making and legislation as the state seeks to manage the data center boom. He’s still holding out hope for a policy solution that requires data center companies to generate their own clean power.

30%: Ford Suppliers Go To Court After Delayed EV Truck

Nexteer and Swoboda Inc. aren't household names the way Ford Motor is, but they ""make"" your car just as much as any automaker does. They're two supplier companies, Chinese and German, respectively, who had a role in making Ford's upcoming full-size electric truck—the one thought to be an F-150 Lightning successor.

But like other aspects of Ford's EV plan, that truck has been pushed back until at least 2028. While Ford was an early mover in the modern EV space as it attempted to chase Tesla's lead with products like the Mustang Mach-E and Lightning, the Blue Oval brand has consistently struggled with EV profitability. Now, many of its original plans have been canceled or delayed, and it's largely resting its electric future on a new affordable EV platform that will yield a $30,000 pickup truck.

As a result, Swoboda is suing Nexteer in an attempt to recoup costs from the delayed truck project.

Here's more on the supplier fight from Crain's Detroit Business:

Swoboda Inc., a German supplier with a base 157 miles West of Detroit in the Grand Rapids suburb of Kentwood, sued its tier-one customer in August, seeking to recoup $3 million it said it incurred before Nexteer “suddenly and unilaterally” canceled the agreement.

Swoboda tooled up to supply Nexteer with cylindrical headers to be used in Ford’s P800 TE1 program, according to the lawsuit filed in Oakland County Circuit Court. The program codename refers to the Dearborn-based automaker’s next-gen full-size electric pickup truck, which was delayed until at least 2028.

Swoboda entered the supply deal in July 2023 and paid for $1.4 million of tooling and $1.2 million of machinery to make the components, according to the complaint, which said that Nexteer has not reimbursed the company.

Put more simply, Nexteer, the larger supplier company, is being sued by the smaller supplier company, Swoboda, which it contracted to make parts for that electric Ford. But with the truck being pushed back, Swoboda aims to get the money back that it spent getting ready for production.

While a fight between two supplier companies isn't the most exciting news around, it speaks volumes about how tricky it is for the entire industry to plan for EV demand, profitability and successful sales. More from that story:

Large tier-one suppliers can withstand program cancellations and delays, but not so for smaller parts makers, said Steven Wybo, senior managing director at Birmingham-based Riveron Consulting LLC.

“The next level of suppliers, under a billion dollars in revenue, those guys are desperate right now because if you had 10-15 percent of business tied up in BEV, and now it’s not launching, or is a fraction of the quoted volumes, you don’t have the luxury of the capital markets or a bunch of cash sitting around to weather it, so you’re getting aggressive,” Wybo said.

A few other supplier lawsuits have been filed for similar reasons, including when Stellantis axed its all-electric Ram truck. The point is, this is a precarious moment, and the fallout is widespread.

60%: Inside Mercedes-Benz's U.S. 'Product Offensive'

Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept smashes several distance records for EVs

I do have to hand it to Mercedes-Benz. While it's retrenching from the tepid reception to its original generation of EQ electric cars, it still has some impressive battery-powered options coming our way soon. And in the meantime, it's also paying the bills with stuff its customers want (more V8 engines) and fewer things they don't want (inexplicable four-cylinder plug-in hybrid AMGs that nobody asked for.)

Best of all, these new EV options aren't expected to be priced too differently from their gas counterparts. More on Mercedes' reset in the U.S. from Automotive News:

After seeing little return from its significant investment in an electric-only model line, Mercedes has moved to a powertrain-agnostic strategy. Starting with the next-generation CLA arriving in December, future models will be available with battery-only and hybrid powertrains.

“It’s not either-or; it’s both,” Chamberlain said, adding that Mercedes will price its EVs in the “same zip code” as their gasoline-powered counterparts. While pricing for the CLA EV has not been disclosed, Mercedes told retailers it will start at more than $48,000 with shipping.

[...] The highlight of the product presentation was a pair of battery-powered AMG models. The AMG GT, a four-door electric sports car riding on the AMG.EA platform, is scheduled to reach dealerships in late 2026.

According to retailers, the AMG GT is a performance beast, with more than 1,000 hp and a 0-to-60 time of 2.3 seconds. It will be powered by three axial flux e-motors that have about four times the power density of conventional radial motors.

“The car is going to be absolutely screaming,” one dealer said.

Supercars are great and all, but I'm rather excited for the new electric CLA-Class and GLC-Class.

90%: Geely Scores A Win As China's EV Market Hits An Inflection Point

China's advanced EV market will soon deal with the situation everyone saw coming: a slowdown after years of exponential growth, a consolidation among a glut of car brands and an end to government subsidies. There are over 100 Chinese car brands, but soon, we'll see who the long-term winners really are.

And the Geely Group—owner of Volvo, Polestar, Zeekr, Geely, Lynk & Co. and others—is netting out pretty well, even if some of those individual brands have their struggles right now. This is especially true of Zeekr, it would seem from the Wall Street Journal:

Geely Automobile delivered a strong third quarter despite stiff competition in its home market of China, with both net profit and revenue rising sharply, supported by effective cost controls and robust sales.

Net profit jumped 59% from a year earlier to 3.82 billion yuan, equivalent to $538.1 million, as revenue climbed 27% to 89.19 billion yuan, the Hangzhou-based automaker said Monday. Geely sold a total of 761,000 vehicles during the quarter, up 43% from the previous year.

The solid set of results comes as Geely has been gaining market share with its strong product offerings. The Chinese automaker has enjoyed rapid growth in sales volume this year, thanks to its wide product range and competitive pricing. The strong momentum prompted the company to raise its annual sales target by about 11% to 3 million vehicles.

Zeekr on Monday posted strong third-quarter sales, with total deliveries rising 12.5% to 140,195 units. Its revenue rose 9.1% to 31.56 billion yuan, and its gross margin improved to 19.2%.

In my experience, the Zeekr and Lynk & Co. EVs and hybrids are better cars than what we've seen from the brands Geely sells in the United States. Both brands are growing fast in Europe, too.

Ford promises that a lot of newer and better EV options are coming, but not until 2027 and 2028—barring any future delays. Given how fast the industry shifts these days, that's both very soon and eons away. Until then, the Lightning and Mach-E will have to carry the day, it seems. Was that the right move, or should Ford have kept some new options coming until then, like most of its competitors?

Air Liquide’s 200MW Normand’Hy hydrogen production project is moving forward towards a 2026 completion date

The astonishing Normand’Hy hydrogen production project has shaken up the European energy market, and the delivery of the first nine of 12 PEM electrolysers marks a significant milestone in the project’s development.

The 200MW Normand’Hy hydrogen is located in Port-Jérôme, France, and is expected to begin operations in 2026, boasting a generating capacity of clean hydrogen around 28,000 tonnes annually. The new electrolyzers were built by Siemens Energy at its joint venture facility in Germany, one of Europe’s largest PEM stack production facilities.

The facility in Berlin has the capacity to increase stack production to 3GW from the 1 GW it currently is capable of. Siemens Energy patted itself on the back for the on-time delivery of the huge electrolyzers for the project, much to the delight of the French government and industry insiders, as they welcome the adoption of hydrogen in Europe.

“With partnerships like these, we are not just talking about a greener future, we are shaping it.” – Siemens Energy

France’s energy revolution has been gaining momentum in recent years

The 200MW Normand’Hy hydrogen in Port-Jérôme exemplifies France’s ambition to increase reliance on the renewable energy sector. The project was launched under the EU’s Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) program and represents a $470 million investment by Air Liquide, not to mention it has the substantial backing of the French government.

Once the project has moved past the construction phase towards operational status, it is expected to produce up to 28,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. And could potentially prevent 250,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually, an incomprehensible amount by modern-day standards.

The entire European energy market will benefit from the new hydrogen project in France

As the project is set for a 2026 completion date, the realization that the European energy market is changing has not been lost on the litany of sectors that will benefit from the 200MW Normand’Hy hydrogen project. Approximately a quarter of the hydrogen produced on-site will serve transport refuelling stations along the Seine Axis, powering up to 500 hydrogen trucks.

While some other European nations have big and innovative hydrogen projects being developed by some of the largest energy companies in the world, the French are fostering a new hydrogen future by developing the astonishing 200 MW hydrogen project. OMV has revealed its progress in developing one of Europe’s biggest green hydrogen electrolysis facilities in Austria.

This overview breaks down the latest progress in sodium-ion technology, covering everything from electrode materials to electrolyte systems, safety improvements, and real-world performance.

Sodium is far more abundant and geographically widespread than lithium, making it cheaper, easier to source, and more environmentally sustainable. On top of that, sodium-ion batteries offer better thermal safety and perform reliably across a wide temperature range.

Still, they're not perfect. Lower energy density, shorter cycle life, and underdeveloped supply chains remain challenges. But ongoing innovations—like high-voltage cathodes, hard carbon anodes, and advanced polymer electrolytes—are steadily improving performance.

This review explores whether sodium-ion batteries can realistically replace, or at least complement, lithium-ion batteries in EVs. By comparing both technologies, we uncover how sodium-ion advancements could help meet future energy storage demands while reducing dependence on scarce lithium resources.

Introduction

Electric vehicles (EVs) are a major step toward reducing global emissions, and their performance largely depends on the batteries powering them. Today, lithium-ion batteries dominate the EV landscape because they deliver high energy density and have been commercially optimized for years.

But lithium-ion technology isn't without issues. Lithium mining raises ethical and environmental concerns, and the global lithium supply chain is vulnerable to price fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. This has sparked interest in alternatives—and sodium-ion batteries are one of the most promising candidates.

Sodium is far more abundant, evenly distributed, and stable than lithium. Plus, sodium-ion batteries share similar electrochemistry with lithium-ion batteries, making them compatible with existing battery manufacturing processes. Their lower energy density is still a drawback, but sodium-ion technology can complement lithium-ion batteries or even replace them in certain EV segments, especially where cost and safety are priorities.

This review brings together the latest research to evaluate whether sodium-ion batteries can genuinely support or replace lithium-ion batteries in the EV sector.

Sodium vs. Lithium: How Do They Stack Up?

Lithium-ion batteries have decades of development behind them, with billions invested in research, factories, and supply chains. But the world's growing demand for lithium, combined with geopolitical instability, is prompting companies to explore alternatives.

Lithium-Ion: The Current Standard

Lithium-ion batteries are popular for good reasons:

High energy density: 250-300 Wh/kg

Long cycle life: 500-1000 cycles

Low self-discharge

These strengths make them ideal for smartphones, laptops, and EVs. However, there are downsides:

Safety issues: They use flammable electrolytes that can cause thermal runaway

Capacity fade: Cathodes degrade over time, causing 12-24% loss

Geopolitical risks: A large share of lithium comes from regions like Chile, where policy changes can impact global supply and pricing

Lithium carbonates have seen extreme price swings—from $6,000 per ton (2020) to $70,000+ (2022)—before stabilizing between $10,000-$25,000 in 2024.

Sodium-Ion: The Rising Contender

Sodium-ion batteries offer several advantages:

Elemental abundance: Sodium is ~1,000 times more common than lithium

Lower cost: Sodium-ion cells currently cost $80-$110 per kWh, cheaper than lithium-ion

Better thermal stability: More resistant to overheating

Wider temperature range: Works from -30°C to 60°C

On the flip side, sodium-ion batteries still struggle with:

Lower energy density: 100-160 Wh/kg

Shorter cycle life

Immature recycling and supply chains

Companies like CATL and Faradion are driving large-scale development, but sodium-ion capacity remains far behind lithium.

Cathode Innovations: Boosting Sodium-Ion Performance

Cathodes play a huge role in determining a battery's energy density and stability. Researchers are exploring several promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries:

High-Voltage Fluorophosphates (A₂MPO₄F)

These materials deliver:

300 mAh/g capacity

Over 1,000 Wh/kg energy density

Operating voltage ≥5V

They are considered next-generation cathode candidates, though synthesis processes are still being optimized.

Sodium Vanadium Phosphate (Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃)

Strengths:

Stable structure

Fast sodium diffusion

Weakness:

Poor conductivity (improved through carbon coating, doping, and porous structures)

Sulfate-Based Cathodes (Na₂Fe₂(SO₄)₃)

These offer high voltage and use abundant elements—making them low-cost and sustainable.

Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs)

PBAs are one of the hottest areas of research thanks to:

Open frameworks for fast Na⁺ movement

Good cycling capability

Low cost

However, they face challenges like:

Structural instability

Water content issues

Vacancy formation

Scientists are addressing these issues using coatings, defect engineering, and doping (e.g., K⁺, Ni, Co, Cu, Cr).

Anode Advancements: Making Sodium Storage More Efficient

Anodes determine how much charge a battery can store and how long it lasts. Sodium-ion anode research focuses on improving cycle life, capacity, and structural stability.

Transition Metal Sulfides (e.g., WS₂)

Pros:

Very high theoretical capacity

Cons:

Large volume expansion during cycling

Low conductivity

Solutions include nanostructuring and carbon-based composites.

Phosphorus-Based Anodes (e.g., Black Phosphorus)

Pros:

Very high capacity

Cons:

Severe volume changes

Researchers are testing nanoscale designs and carbon hybrids to stabilize them.

Carbon-Based Anodes (Hard & Soft Carbon)

These are currently the most commercially viable sodium-ion anodes.

Hard Carbon

Capacity: 250-400 mAh/g

Stores sodium through adsorption, interlayer intercalation, and nanopore filling

Flexible structure helps keep cycling performance stable

Soft Carbon

Lower capacity (150-250 mAh/g)

Can be enhanced through nitrogen doping or conductive additives

Graphite, commonly used in lithium-ion batteries, doesn't work well for sodium because its interlayer spacing is too small.

Electrolytes: Ensuring Smooth Sodium Transport

Electrolytes allow sodium ions to move between electrodes. Several types exist, each with benefits and limitations.

Liquid Electrolytes

Pros:

High ionic conductivity

Fast charging

Excellent electrode compatibility

Example: NaPF₆

Cons:

Flammable organic solvents

Higher risk of thermal runaway

Solid-State Electrolytes

Pros:

Non-flammable

Safe and stable

No leakage

Typical conductivity: 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³ S/cm (lower than liquids)

Newer ceramics and sulfides are improving conductivity and stability.

Polymer Electrolytes

Pros:

Lightweight, flexible, easy to process

No leakage

Good safety profile

Cons:

Lower room-temperature conductivity

Gels (GPEs) and solid polymer systems (SPEs) are being enhanced with nanofillers like SiO₂ and TiO₂.

Composite Electrolytes

Hybrid systems combining polymers + ceramics offer the best of both:

High ionic conductivity

Good flexibility

Better thermal stability

These are emerging as a strong candidate for future sodium-ion EV batteries.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 13:01:07.505729

Surging electricity demand — fueled by manufacturing growth, artificial intelligence data centers and population shifts — threatens grid reliability.

The average U.S. household spent about $142 a month on electricity in 2024, with some states paying far more.

The Energy Department said in July that 100 times as many blackouts could darken communities by 2030 if the country keeps shutting down power plants without building new ones.

The administration has taken several steps to deliver on Trump's campaign promise to strengthen the grid.

What the administration has done

In April, Trump signed an executive order directing the Energy Department to protect the electric grid by:

Using emergency powers faster and more often. The order directs the department to streamline orders under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. That means the department should issue emergency orders faster when the power grid is at risk — to keep certain power plants running during extreme weather, for example.

Finding where the grid is weakest. The department must create a uniform method to figure out which parts of the country face the highest risk of outages or blackouts.

Speeding up construction and approvals. The order tells federal agencies to accelerate permitting for energy projects, such as new transmission lines or power plant upgrades.

The order also requires the department to ""systemize and expedite"" emergency orders and to measure how close each region is to running out of power. In July, the department issued Section 202(c) orders in some states to keep certain oil- and coal-fired units operating through seasonal peaks.

The White House said the order is necessary to shore up reliability.

Pushback and legal challenges

The Energy Department's use of emergency power has triggered legal challenges. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, petitioned the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review an Energy Department order that forced the J.H. Campbell coal plant in the state to stay open past its planned retirement. Nessel said ratepayers will bear heavy costs as a result.

A 17-state coalition also sued the administration over energy-policy actions it says favor fossil fuels over renewables, arguing that the federal government is undermining state autonomy.

Both cases are pending.

Some energy-efficiency advocates also see a contradiction between the administration's rhetoric about modernizing the grid and rolling back conservation standards.

Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a group that advocates for energy-efficiency standards, said one of the best ways to protect the grid is to use conservation policies that reduce energy waste.

""The administration has proposed to weaken those standards for more than a dozen products,"" deLaski said, ""and that takes us in precisely the wrong direction.""

Our ruling

Trump promised to modernize U.S. electric grid systems to improve reliability and reduce costs. His April 8 executive order and the Energy Department's follow-up mark the first major steps toward that goal, expanding federal emergency powers and launching grid assessments.

But large-scale construction and permanent modernization funding have yet to materialize. We will revisit this promise as the administration's grid program develops. For now, this promise remains In the Works.",https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP18226660099611/6b6307ee2341223e86ec5d0f5d9848a1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:09.519608

The milestones mark continued progress in the partners’ long-term collaboration to develop a portfolio of solar projects that will expand and diversify Colombia’s renewable energy capacity, supporting the country’s transition to a cleaner, more resilient power system. The innovative character of this initiative also lies in how the support of EU public funding serves to de-risk and unlock an exponentially larger volume of private investment.

Pétalo del Norte I, located between Cesar and Norte de Santander, is CFM’s first project to reach commercial operations in Latin America. Developed in partnership with Erco Energía and implemented by Andina Solar, the 26.4 MWdc (19.9 MWac) fixed-tilt solar PV facility generates more than 45 GWh of clean energy annually, avoiding an estimated 13 276 tpy of CO2 emissions and serving approximately 32 600 people. Interconnection is through a 1.2 km aerial line at 34.5 kV. The project created 270 jobs, 64% of which were filled by local workers, with women repre-senting 30% of the workforce.

CFM invested close to US$20 million in both development capital and construction funding through its EU-supported renewable energy infrastructure fund, Climate Investor One (CIO). The project benefits from a 15-year power purchase agreement with an independent energy trader, providing long-term revenue stability.

Through its US$125 000 Community Development Programme, Pétalo del Norte I is delivering targeted social investments across four neighbouring communities – La Pedregosa, La Fragua, La Raya, and Palmichal. Developed in partnership with local leaders, the programme supports education, access to clean water, women’s empowerment, and rural enterprise development. Initiatives include upgrading community infrastructure, promoting youth development through sport, and strengthening local leadership and business skills, benefiting an estimated 2400 people.

CFM has invested US$1.5 million in development funding from Climate Investor One to support the development of a second solar facility in the region. Located on adjacent land, the Pradera solar-plus-storage plant will add 40 MWac of solar capacity and 18 MWh of battery storage, making it the largest installation of its kind in Colombia. Once operational, Pradera will generate over 95.8 GWh/y of clean energy, avoiding approximately 129 000 t of CO2 emissions and supplying power to approximately 71 000 people. The project is expected to create approximately 380 jobs during construction and 29 permanent positions in operation. A dedicated Community Development Programme will be implemented in consultation with local stakeholders to support neighbouring communities.

Pradera represents an important innovation in Colombia’s energy transition through the integration of a battery energy storage system (BESS). Designed to smooth short-term fluctuations in solar generation, the BESS will help manage grid imbalances and limit exposure to the country’s high-cost spot market during dry periods, including El Niño events. By enabling more stable and predictable power output, Pradera will enhance grid reliability and support greater penetration of solar energy in Colombia’s national electricity system.

Both projects were enabled by CFM’s blended finance model, which combines public and private capital to balance risk, lower financing costs and accelerate project delivery. CFM invests across the project lifecycle, from development to construction and operation, avoiding the complexity and long timelines associated with traditional project finance.

Juan Paez, Head of Latin America at Climate Fund Managers, said: “Access to capital for climate infrastructure remains one of the main barriers to achieving Colombia’s 2050 net zero ambition. Our partnership with Erco Energía, supported by the EU, shows how blended finance can help bridge that gap – unlocking investment for projects that strengthen energy security and accelerate the clean energy transition. With Pétalo del Norte now operational and Pradera in development, we are building a solar platform that will deliver sustainable growth across the country.”

Alberto Menghini, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation in Colombia, added: “The EU is Colombia’s main energy transition partner, not only through Foreign Direct Investments, but also through financial mechanisms such as CFM’s Climate Investor One Fund. Under the Global Gateway, CFM´s blended finance model strategically leverages funding from public institutions like the EU and other European partners to de-risk projects and mobilise private capital. This approach enables transformative initiatives such as Pétalo del Norte I and Pradera, which strengthen and diversify Colombia’s energy mix while creating local jobs and opportunities. At scale, such partnerships can make a significant contribution to regional development and global climate goals.”

Juan Camilo López, CEO and Co-Founder of Erco Energía, commented: “Expanding solar generation is essential to strengthen Colombia’s energy security and resilience.

EVERYONE LOVES TO HATE: A shared enemy is always a great way to make friends. Both President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani agreed in their surprising congenial appearance that Con Edison, the utility that serves electric and gas customers in the city, should lower its costs. The company reacted defensively as its stock dropped after hours — regulatory risk is a major concern for investors.

“Con Edison powers the economic engine of our country by delivering the most reliable energy to more than 9 million people who live, work, and travel through New York City every day,” Con Ed spokesperson Anne Marie Corbalis said in a statement. “We recognize affordability is a critical issue and work every day to balance the investments needed for resilience and reliability with customer costs.”

Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has bashed Con Ed in the past. The DSA generally supports public takeovers of utilities — something other Democrats have flirted with in the past, including former Mayor Bill de Blasio. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened to revoke Con Ed’s franchise after high-profile outages and Gov. Kathy Hochul slammed the utility’s latest rate hike proposal.

Con Ed’s rates are regulated by the state Public Service Commission, which is considering another rate increase for the utility’s customers. It’s a more modest revenue increase —roughly 3 percent each year for electric and 2 percent for gas each year for three years — than Con Ed initially sought.

Mamdani’s campaign didn’t respond to questions about his position on that rate plan when it was announced.

One major lever Mamdani has that could influence Con Ed’s rates? The $3 billion in property taxes the company expects to pay in 2026. The utility has long sought to address that cost, which it passes along to customers. As Con Ed invests more in its infrastructure to address electrification and growing demand, those assets add to the company’s tax bill from the city.

Mamdani didn’t have any specifics on how he’d tackle utility costs when asked on Sunday. — Marie J. French

What you may have missed

DEMS’ CLIMATE DIVIDE — POLITICO’s Marie J. French and Mona Zhang: A dividing line is forming over New York’s ambitious climate goals and Gov. Kathy Hochul’s affordability push. And state Democrats are starting to take sides.

Hochul signaled that she’s open to changing the state’s landmark 2019 law requiring massive emissions cuts after a judge ruled her administration must issue regulations to achieve its targets. She has steered the state toward an “all of the above” energy policy as she focuses on affordability and reliability concerns ahead of a tough reelection next year.

And her latest actions — approving a pipeline and a gas power plant permit, plus delaying a mandate to electrify new buildings — have raised the ire of environmental advocates and progressive lawmakers, who warn years of progress are at risk.

CROSS-BRONX MOVES FORWARD: New York State Department of Transportation released its environmental assessment for a project to rehabilitate the Cross-Bronx Expressway, which has drawn concern from community advocates.

The department “is committed to working with the community and our local partners to reimagine the entire Cross Bronx Expressway corridor and this project is an important step toward that goal,” NYSDOT Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said in a statement. — Mona Zhang

ALL PROPOSALS REJECTED: Members of PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator that covers more than a dozen Eastern states including New Jersey, on Wednesday rejected 12 proposals on how to handle its interconnection process for data centers.

The PJM member committee voted as part of the regional grid operator’s Critical Issue Fast Path process for addressing urgent issues. In August, the PJM Board of Managers initiated the CIFP process to respond to increasing demand driven by data centers.

While the member committee vote is advisory, it is supposed to guide decision-making at the PJM Board of Managers, which will have a final say on rules for large load interconnections.

The vote “should tell us a lot about how PJM members are feeling the mounting pressure from governors and consumer advocates in the public,” said Seth Nelson, a spokesperson for Evergreen Action, which supports three proposals that would have strong ratepayer protections. “None of them really wanted to be on the record, potentially voting for a plan that could ultimately raise bills significantly for millions of households.”

The details: The member committee considered a wide range of proposals on Wednesday, including ones from consumer advocates and state lawmakers to a data center trade group and energy companies.

It’s unclear when the board will make a decision on the matter, but it has stated that it wants to decide on rules to submit to FERC next month in hopes of having them in place for the June 2026 capacity auction. — Mona Zhang

PLUG POWER PLAY — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: An unprofitable Latham, N.Y.-based hydrogen company has a potentially valuable electric substation on its balance sheet that it’s looking to unload.

Plug Power has abandoned plans for a green hydrogen plant in upstate New York that were announced in 2021. But the company sees an opportunity to recover some of its roughly $100 million investment thanks to the latest hot energy trend: data centers for artificial intelligence workloads.

“We kind of came to the conclusion that the better value for us was selling the electricity rights,” said Andy Marsh, Plug Power’s outgoing CEO

ADVOCATES SUE OVER NESE PERMITS — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: A coalition of environmental advocates filed lawsuits Tuesday over New Jersey and New York’s decisions to grant water quality permits for Williams Transco’s Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline.

The project still poses the same risks to the environment as it did in prior years when both the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection denied water quality permits for the pipeline, advocates argue.

MAYORS FOR CLIMATE SUPERFUND: A bipartisan group of more than 100 New Jersey mayors and elected officials — including Newark’s Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka, Madison’s Republican Mayor Robert Conley and Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, a Democrat who is also running for Congress — is pushing state lawmakers to pass a “climate superfund” bill to collect billions of dollars from coal, gas and oil companies to pay for climate change-related damage.

The bill has cleared a committee apiece in the Assembly and Senate. A similar law in New York is being challenged in court.

“As a bipartisan group of local elected officials, we all know the adage: ‘There is no Republican or Democratic pothole,’” the elected officials wrote. “Today, we write to say there are no blue or red floods or heat waves. Every community in New Jersey is experiencing the growing costs of climate impacts, from increased flooding and heat waves.”

One of the mayors who signed the letter, Hoboken’s Ravi Bhalla, will hold a related press conference with other officials, including state Sen. John McKeon, who sponsored the bill, at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the Atlantic City Convention Center during the New Jersey League of Municipalities Annual Conference. — Ry Rivard

BYOG: HOCHUL FAVORS DATA CENTERS BRINGING NEW ENERGY — Gov. Kathy Hochul prefers data centers bring their own new clean source of energy to hook up to New York’s grid, she indicated at a press conference last Monday. She also floated the idea of new large data centers supporting small nuclear reactors.

A surge in large energy requests, primarily linked to data centers, has led to a forecasted potential energy shortfall in the coming decade, according to the independent grid operator. Hochul has embraced artificial intelligence as a potential economic development driver and generally prioritized meeting the energy needs of industries coming to New York. She’s expressed more openness to natural gas power and new nuclear, alongside renewables and storage, to increase the electricity supply.

“They are drains on the grid, so I am open to [data] centers that can demonstrate their own independent source,” Hochul said after being asked about the impacts of data centers. “Some are building near plants that have been shut down and they’ll generate clean energy from them — that gets my attention more.”

It’s akin to a concept dubbed “bring your own generation.” The Trump administration has also expressed support for having data centers build their own power supply. Policymakers in New York and across the country are concerned that the surging demand from AI could increase electricity prices for consumers. A bill proposed in New York would require data centers to get some of their power from renewables. — Marie J. French

SENATE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR REPEAL OF BUILDINGS MANDATE: Fresh off a victory as Gov. Kathy Hochul delayed the state’s all-electric building mandate, Senate Republicans are now calling for a special legislative session to repeal the measure altogether. Hochul this month paused implementation of the prohibition on gas stoves and furnaces for new single-family homes and other small buildings.

“Governor Hochul must move farther than the pause to protect New Yorkers by fully repealing this mandate,” said Republican Sen. Mario Mattera, ranking member on the Energy Committee. “Short of that, this could seemingly be undone like the bait-and-switch she foisted on the residents with congestion pricing and that is unacceptable.”

The requirement was part of the state’s building code set to go into effect in January. Her spokesperson said the delay — for at least 120 days after a decision on the appeal of a lawsuit challenging the measure — would provide more certainty for homebuilders. The state had won the initial court case defending the law in a lower federal court and fought an injunction in court filings just weeks earlier.

Senate Republicans called for a delay on the all-electric building requirement in early October. Shortly after, Assembly Democrats started circulating a letter asking the governor to delay and Hochul said she was considering it. — Marie J. French

$1+ TRILLION IN PROFITS: Frustrated with Gov. Kathy Hochul’s shift on climate and energy policy, advocates and lawmakers are pushing the governor to consider ending taxpayer subsidies for oil companies.

A new analysis of eight oil companies, including Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil and Shell, found that the major oil companies have raked in $1.2 trillion since 2021, according to the nonprofit research organization New York Public Interest Research Group.

Lawmakers and climate advocates are pushing Hochul to support legislation to repeal some oil industry tax subsidies.

“We’re talking about affordability all the time now,” environmental advocate Bill McKibben told reporters last week. “How on earth can a strapped New York state be giving handouts to the richest companies on the face of the planet?”

A bill sponsored by state Sen. Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon, would repeal about $350 million of $1.8 billion in oil subsidies. — Mona Zhang

Six proposed exemptions would narrow reporting obligations for many manufacturers

Shrinking the reporting window could create timing pressures

The EPA is seeking input on de minimis levels, reporting thresholds, and study submission requirement

On November 13, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revisions to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) PFAS Reporting Rule that would substantially narrow reporting obligations and significantly accelerate the timeline for data submissions. The proposal introduces six exemptions, shortens the submission period to three months, advances the start date, and provides several technical corrections and clarifications. The EPA maintains that the changes—particularly the exemptions—will reduce industry costs and avoid duplicative reporting requirements. Businesses should assess how the proposal impacts their reporting obligations and consider submitting comments before the December 29, 2025 deadline.

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule

Promulgated in October 2023, the TSCA PFAS reporting rule requires manufacturers, including importers and small manufacturers, to electronically report per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) data for any year from 2011 through 2022, including information on use, production volumes, disposal, exposures, and hazards.

Previous Delays and Public Comments

The EPA has twice delayed the reporting deadline.

When announcing the interim final rule in May 2025, the EPA also stated that it may reopen certain aspects of the rule to public comment, citing concerns about overburdening small businesses and article importers. In response, stakeholders requested exemptions—for example, for article importers and for de minimis PFAS concentrations—and sought clarification on the “known or reasonably ascertainable” due diligence standard and concerns about the Central Data Exchange (CDX) data submission platform.

On August 29, 2025, the EPA sent a proposed revision to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. The proposal was expected to be published in December 2025, with a final rule anticipated in June 2026.

Proposed Exemptions and Other Changes

In the proposed rule, the EPA introduced six exemptions:

PFAS manufactured or imported in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1% (de minimis exemption).

PFAS imported as part of an “article” (defined in 40 C.F.R. 704.3).

PFAS solely manufactured as “byproducts” (as described in 40 C.F.R. 720.30(h)) and not used commercially.

PFAS present as an “impurity” (defined in 40 C.F.R. 704.3).

Non-isolated intermediates.

PFAS manufactured or imported in small quantities solely for research and development (R&D).

The EPA stated that these exemptions are intended to align with the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. 711), with the addition of the de minimis exemption, which would apply regardless of total production volume of the mixture or article. The EPA also indicated it may consider future data requests for R&D chemicals if necessary.

The EPA also proposed adjustments to the reporting schedule. Under the proposal, the submission period will begin 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and last for three months. Because of the proposed exemption for article importers, the EPA would remove the later deadline for small manufacturers reporting exclusively as article importers. The agency explained that given the time that has passed since the 2023 rule was issued, reporting entities have had “adequate time” to prepare.

Additionally, the EPA proposed a few technical corrections to clarify what must be reported in certain fields, including clarifications on the scope of environmental and health effects information and updates to product category names.

Reasons for the Proposed Changes

The EPA stated that the main reasons for the proposed changes are to reduce compliance costs and burdens on industry and avoid unnecessary or duplicative reporting. The agency emphasized that the proposed exemptions are the “primary purpose” of the proposed rule. The EPA’s goal is to exempt “reporting on activities about which manufacturers are least likely to know or reasonably ascertain” and to apply reporting obligations to only those persons likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of the TSCA. The EPA estimates cost savings of $786 million – $843 million, based on a reduction of 10 million – 11 million hours. The EPA also reasoned that it may defer collecting certain information until there is “a clear role” for that information to support an agency mission.

What Did Not Change

The proposed rule would not disturb several other key elements of the existing rule, including:

The lookback period (January 1, 2011 – December 31, 2022).

The definition of PFAS.

The specific data required to be reported.

The “known or reasonably ascertainable” due diligence standard.

EPA’s Request for Public Comment

The 45-day comment period is open through December 29, 2025.

The EPA requested public comment on certain issues, including:

Whether the de minimis exemption should be 1.0% rather than the proposed 0.1%, or another appropriate level.

Potential ways to consolidate the proposed exemptions while providing relief.

Whether to continue requiring full study reports under 40 C.F.R. 705.15(f) or to allow “robust study summaries” with full study reports available upon EPA request.

Whether reportable chemicals should be limited to PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN), TSCA Accession Number, or Low-Volume Exemption Number.

Whether to add a production volume threshold below which reporting on a given PFAS would not be required (e.g., 2,500 lbs.) and what threshold would be appropriate.

Whether any assumptions or cost savings calculations in the EPA’s economic analysis should be revised.

Impact on Industry

The proposed exemptions heed long-standing industry requests to ease burdens and would minimize compliance costs for certain PFAS in imported articles; in de minimis concentrations; as impurities, byproducts, and non-isolated intermediates; and for R&D uses.

At the same time, the accelerated submission period would introduce a near-term compliance burden. Instead of a six-month reporting period beginning April 13, 2026, companies would have only three months, starting 60 days after the final rule’s effective date, likely mid-2026. Although the EPA maintains that businesses have had “adequate time” to prepare, the proposed changes will require businesses to act quickly in preparing their data for submission. The condensed reporting schedule also raises concerns about whether the CDX platform is prepared to receive large amounts of data from many reporting entities in a short period.

The EPA also signaled a willingness to consider and potentially incorporate stakeholder input. Five of the six proposed exemptions were included in a May 2, 2025 petition by a coalition of chemical companies submitted to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. That letter also suggested several changes the EPA specifically sought further public comment on, such as the production volume threshold and the option to provide robust study summaries in lieu of full study reports. Although the agency decided not to propose a production volume threshold as suggested in stakeholder feedback, the EPA indicated that it was still “amenable” to comments on the potential benefits and drawbacks of providing one.

Businesses should consider submitting public comments in an effort to help shape the final rule, including on the proposed exemptions, the adjusted data submission period, or the technical clarifications. Stakeholders may also find it beneficial to focus on the issues the EPA specifically sought input on, such as the appropriate de minimis level and whether alternatives to full study reports should be allowed.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15546_5043.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:03:48.088760

Focusing on the Belt and Road Initiative's (BRI) green development, and promoting global ecological cooperation, the ""Belt and Road"" Eco-industry Cooperation Working Committee of the All-China Environment Federation (ACEF) hosted a side event at COP30 in the UN Press Room, to share low-carbon practices and Chinese successful cases in this vital area of lowering emissions.

A highlight of the ACEF session was the presentation by Changzhou Power Supply Company of the State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd., which unveiled its ""Electric-Steam Cube"" solution. Designed to address the industrial dilemma of securing steam power that is sufficient, low-cost, and low-carbon, the technology offers a powerful engine for industrial green transformation.

The ""Electric-Steam Cube"" innovatively integrates three energy sources: photovoltaics (PV), off-peak electricity, and industrial waste heat. Utilizing electrode boilers and high-temperature heat pumps, the system produces steam at temperatures between 120 and 160 degrees Celsius.

To overcome the challenge of energy intermittency, the company developed large-scale thermal storage tanks. These tanks use high pressure to condense steam into water for storage; when needed, the pressure is released to revert the water to steam. The system achieves an energy conversion efficiency of over 95 percent, ensuring a continuous, stable, and flexible supply of clean steam.

Beyond the technology, the company introduced a collaborative business model combining ""technology licensing and construction investment."" By uniting energy service companies, equipment manufacturers, and energy consumers, the model has accelerated the large-scale adoption of clean energy technology.

To date, 118 of these models have been deployed across eight provinces in China, generating direct economic benefits of 830 million RMB. Environmental metrics are equally impressive: the system reduces carbon dioxide emissions in the steam production process by over two-thirds and completely eliminates sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.

Furthermore, the cost of the system is only one-sixth that of electrochemical energy storage. It functions as a flexible composite resource capable of responding within 30 seconds to absorb fluctuating PV power, thereby enhancing the stability of new power systems.

Second, when it comes to new data centers, Michigan’s major utilities and the MPSC have yet to give clean energy requirements the attention they deserve.","It’s been a busy few weeks for the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). Late on Halloween, electric utility DTE filed an application seeking expedited, ex parte approval of a contract with a data center requesting 1.4 gigawatt (GW) of electricity, in a deal which had been announced by Governor Whitmer’s office the day before. This electricity demand, equivalent to over a million homes, would increase the utility’s load by 25%. With its ex parte filing, DTE is seeking direct approval from the commission without an opportunity for advocates like UCS to intervene.

Less than a week later, the MPSC issued an order in a docket filed by another major utility, Consumers Energy, seeking changes to the terms and conditions which apply to data centers and other large loads. As I discussed in my last blog, UCS intervened in the case with a coalition of clean energy organizations that recommended several ways that data centers could support Michigan’s efforts to provide reliable, clean, and affordable electricity.

While the MPSC agreed broadly with our analysis and showed progress on cost protections, major gaps remain to ensure grid reliability and meeting clean energy requirements. Nevertheless, the details in the MPSC’s order give UCS and other advocates several potential avenues to pursue in future cases, including the current DTE filing.

In this blog, I’ll pull out some key points from both cases and share some next steps we’ll be working on as we continue to fight for reliable, clean, and affordable electricity for all Michiganders.

Case 1: Consumers Energy sought basic financial protections

In February, Consumers Energy filed an application to establish new requirements for data centers, including:

Significant load changes must be coordinated with the utility.

Contracts must be at least 15 years and include minimum billing amounts.

Large loads must pay for any infrastructure upgrades they trigger.

Upfront fees will be charged to increase transparency and discourage speculative projects.

While these measures support affordability for all utility customers, they also benefit the company’s bottom line. Consumers Energy is an investor-owned, for-profit utility that earns a guaranteed profit on capital investments, so the company is highly motivated to attract data centers which will require spending on new infrastructure. And the proposed requirements protect shareholder profits, in addition to protecting other customers.

UCS argued for clean energy and reliability

In testimony and briefs, our Michigan coalition argued that these terms did not go far enough, advocating for three additional measures to support affordability, reliability, and emissions reductions:

Data centers should bring their own clean energy.

The interconnection process should be reformed to prioritize data centers that provide load flexibility and on-site clean energy.

Utilities should regularly report on whether data centers are fulfilling the above requirements.

For more details on our recommendations and the rationale behind each, check out my last blog on Michigan’s data center debate.

The commission’s order did not go far enough

After considering testimony, exhibits, cross-examination, and briefs from over a dozen parties to the case, the MPSC issued a final order on November 6.

The order generally approved Consumers Energy’s requested terms, with some added reporting requirements based in part on our recommendations. Affordability was handled through new requirements addressing cost allocation in future filings. In a major disappointment, the commission failed to take up clean energy requirements or interconnection reform.

Affordability protections were strengthened

Cost allocation determines whether the specific rate that data centers pay for electricity covers all their costs, or if some of those costs will be shifted to other customers. The order explains: “A core tenet of ratemaking is that customers are responsible for the costs they impose on the system and the costs required to serve them. Residential, commercial, and other industrial customers should not have to pay for investments driven solely by large load additions.”

After describing a business-as-usual scenario where data center costs are shifted to residential customers, the commission succinctly summarizes: “This is unacceptable.”

To address this, the MPSC ruled that cost allocation be handled in a traditional rate case, with new requirements added for large loads like data centers. Specifically, Consumers Energy will need to include six different proposed rate structures ranging from keeping the status quo to establishing new rates specific to large loads. This will allow intervenors and the commission to evaluate the impact of data centers on all customers, with the requirement that Consumers “provide a summary exhibit comparing the impacts of these six cost allocation and rate design proposals on all customer classes on a side-by-side basis.”

Then, before each data center is connected, Consumers Energy must file a detailed application demonstrating that “costs caused by the interconnecting large load customer to be served under this tariff are not being paid for by other customers.” Any special contracts addressing specific generation and interconnection needs must also be filed with the commission and supported with the same level of detail.

Together, these requirements are directly relevant to DTE’s filing, as I will explain below.

Action on clean energy requirements and load flexibility deferred

While acknowledging that a hypothetical large load customer “is potentially orders of magnitude larger than any customer currently taking service,” the MPSC’s order does not recognize the paradigm-shifting impact this will have on the utility’s ability to meet its renewable energy obligations. Instead, the order simply noted that several future proceedings may be relevant: clean energy plans, renewable energy plans, integrated resource plans, voluntary green pricing tariff cases, and rate cases.

While it deferred decisions on cost allocation to future proceedings, the MPSC did provide detailed guidance on how to handle it. Without similar details on how utilities should manage their clean energy requirements, there is a risk that this critical issue will never be adequately addressed. If utilities and the commission continually punt on clean energy requirements, it will eventually be too late to build enough renewables, resulting in missed targets, increased costs (as federal incentives for renewables expire, among other factors), and stalled progress on addressing climate change.

Finally, the commissioners ruled that while they support load flexibility, they don’t see a need to reform the interconnection process to prioritize flexible or clean-energy-backed loads. They pointed to the April 2023 interconnection rule update as “recent,” overlooking that it predated the surge in hyperscale data centers. UCS and our partners in Michigan are developing a strategy for raising this issue with the MPSC again, especially as others around the US are evaluating interconnection reform which would account for load flexibility and on-site energy.

Case 2: DTE’s Stargate proposal

Now the big question—what does all of this mean for the proposed 1.4 GW data center in DTE’s territory? First, a quick summary of what DTE is asking for: Oracle is seeking to build a 1.4 GW data center to be used by OpenAI (the maker of ChatGPT) as part of its Stargate project. The new data center would be connected to DTE’s system in December 2026, with the full 1.4 GW online within one year.

This single facility would increase DTE’s load by roughly 25 percent, causing the utility to fall short of resource adequacy requirements. To address that shortfall, DTE proposes building 1.4 GW of batteries, paid for by Oracle. The batteries would be spread around the utility’s service territory, mostly at existing solar and wind energy sites.

First things first: the MPSC should deny ex parte approval

The first decision the commission will need to make in this case is whether to grant ex parte approval. In an ex parte proceeding, the MPSC would consider only the information filed by the utility in making a ruling, which Michigan law allows when utilities make changes that will not increase the cost of service to other customers. Consumers Energy had sought the same type of approval for its filing, but the commission ultimately ordered a contested case after a petition by UCS and others, finding that “the electric load of new data centers presents unique and significant cost implications, and the development of an evidentiary record […] is prudent and reasonable.” We believe the same is true here.

Another concern with DTE’s application is the breakneck pace: the heavily redacted contract stipulates that the MPSC approve the application by December 5, just 35 days after filing. That is not nearly enough time for the commission to evaluate the full impacts of DTE’s application, which involves hundreds of millions in investment and the addition of the largest single customer to ever connect to the grid in Michigan.

As we’ve petitioned, the MPSC should convert DTE’s proceeding to a contested case, just like Consumers Energy’s case, and establish a more reasonable schedule, giving time to fully examine the potential impacts to cost, reliability, and clean energy obligations.

DTE doesn’t give enough detail to verify cost protections

In proposing contract terms similar to Consumers Energy, DTE asserts that other customers would be protected from covering any costs related to the data center. But connecting the facility to the grid is expected to cost $500 million in infrastructure upgrades—most of which will be spread across all ratepayers. DTE claims its contract terms will offset this by diluting other costs.

Thanks to the MPSC’s ruling in the Consumers Energy case, we know that this cost protection is necessary and exactly what information is needed to confirm it. Yet DTE’s application provides nowhere near the level of detail needed to make that determination.

DTE is silent on clean energy and load flexibility

While DTE gives some details of how the batteries would address a capacity shortfall caused by the data center, there is no discussion of where the energy will come from. Similar to the MPSC’s order in the Consumers’ case, DTE seeks to defer the issue to a future proceeding: “The resources necessary to meet the Company’s long-term energy and capacity needs will be determined in the Company’s 2026 IRP filing.” In other words: we’ll figure that out later.

This includes clean energy requirements: DTE doesn’t anticipate this project causing a shortfall until 2033, so doesn’t intend to update its renewable energy plan until it’s required to do so next December. But these plans take close to a year for approval, meaning that DTE wouldn’t have an updated renewable plan until late 2027 when the Stargate project is nearly complete, leaving less than five years to bring new solar and wind projects online prior to the projected shortfall. Given that the wait to get new generators connected to the grid is three to four years (as we pointed out in the Consumers Energy case), this is cutting it close. Adding further urgency, DTE is in “advanced discussions” with another 3 GW new data center load.

When it comes to flexibility, DTE’s proposal to use batteries might indicate support for this tool for integrating data centers with the grid, but the details tell a different story: there’s no discussion of load flexibility, non-wires alternatives, or virtual power plants—which can all be used to leverage and increase the value of batteries. Further, the batteries won’t be installed near the data center where they could be used to balance its demand on the local grid, reducing costs; instead, they’ll be spread throughout DTE’s territory, wherever they can be interconnected for the lowest cost.

This approach is penny-wise and pound-foolish: with careful planning, some portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on batteries could reduce the $500 million in costs other ratepayers will bear to interconnect the data center. Further, other options, such as using the batteries in a virtual power plant arrangement, could address the inevitable energy shortfalls and reliability challenges from the massive new load. None of these solutions were considered in DTE’s application.

What comes next?

The immediate next step in the DTE case is a public hearing on December 3, where the MPSC will seek input directly from the public about the data center proposal. UCS is asking our Michigan-based members to participate and request that the commission convert this important proceeding to a contested case where it can be given the proper scrutiny. Those who are not able to attend the hearing can comment directly on the docket.

As we look to the future, there are several other conclusions we can draw from these two cases. First, the MPSC is rightfully concerned about the risk of cost shifting and seeks abundant detail from utilities on how it will be prevented; details which are lacking in DTE’s application.

Second, when it comes to new data centers, Michigan’s major utilities and the MPSC have yet to give clean energy requirements the attention they deserve. Guidance is needed from the MPSC that confronts the scale and urgency of the challenge. Similar to how it is addressing cost shifting, the MPSC should issue detailed requirements for assessing the impacts of large loads on clean energy obligations in utilities’ integrated resource and renewable energy plans. Further requirements should ensure that the utilities include specific details of how each new data center will comply as it seeks interconnection approval.

Finally, the MPSC must recognize the need to reform the load interconnection process to account for load flexibility and its potential to support grid reliability and affordability.

Hyperscale data centers are forcing a step-change in how the grid is planned and operated, and Michigan’s utility regulators are right to be concerned about cost shifting. But the same care and concern must also be applied to clean energy requirements and interconnection reform to ensure that data centers support a clean, reliable, and affordable grid for all Michiganders.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Blog-Thumbnail-pylons-in-red.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:03:12.692710

Kicking off this edition of Projects Weekly is Arevon’s 124 MW Big Muddy Solar Project in Illinois. Plus, we’re covering a new affordable housing community in Oklahoma City that will use a rooftop solar system to power common areas for residents. Also highlighted are two big financing deals from ForeFront Power and SolaREIT. Keep reading to learn more!

Arevon begins construction on Big Muddy Solar

Arevon Energy Inc. held a groundbreaking ceremony for its 124 MWdc Big Muddy Solar Project in Jackson County, Illinois. The project will be able to produce enough domestic energy to power more than 24,000 homes when it achieves commercial operation at the end of 2026.

The company developed and will own and operate the Big Muddy Solar Project, which represents nearly $200 million in private investment and the company’s first utility-scale project in Illinois. Arevon partnered with Signal Energy to build the project, which will employ more than 250 workers, including from local labor organizations IBEW Local 702, IUOE Local 318, and Laborers’ International Union of North America Local Union 773. Big Muddy Solar is under a long-term virtual power purchase agreement with an unnamed U.S.-based multinational technology company.

Cool factor: Previously known as Campbell Solar, the project was renamed Big Muddy Solar to acknowledge the river that winds through Jackson County, and the project’s logo includes an outline of Murphysboro’s legendary Big Muddy Monster, a nod to local pride and history.

Not only will Big Muddy Solar generate abundant, affordable power, but it will also strengthen the local economy. More than $12.6 million in property tax payments will be disbursed over the life of the project, supporting schools, public safety, and community infrastructure.

Arevon hosted a milestone event on Nov. 18 to celebrate Big Muddy Solar’s construction and Arevon’s significant investment in Jackson County’s energy future. Attending alongside the Arevon team were public officials, community and business leaders, landowners, and other project stakeholders, including Kevin Smith, CEO at Arevon; C.J. Calandro, Jackson County Board chairman; Dawn McClerren, executive director at Murphysboro Chamber of Commerce; Matthew Hickam, regional superintendent of schools at Regional Office of Education #30; Brian Chapman, Jackson Growth Alliance chairman; and Justin Haney, Special Agent at Illinois State Police and Coordinator at Team Illinois Youth Police Camp. Jemma King, development manager at Arevon, served as Master of Ceremonies.

“Big Muddy Solar’s impactful investment delivers real value for businesses and families in Jackson County, and Arevon is pleased to be a part of this community for decades to come,” said Smith. “As we advance construction, we gratefully recognize the collaboration with area officials and the residents of Murphysboro, as well as the dedication of the local workers building our project. This facility will not only generate essential, domestically produced energy as electricity demand in the U.S. rises dramatically, but it will also strengthen the region through tax revenue and continued community engagement.”

Solar powers affordable housing community in Oklahoma

In other groundbreaking news, affordable housing developer Lincoln Avenue Communities (LAC) began construction on 267-unit community in Oklahoma City that will feature a rooftop solar installation to offset common area electricity use.

“LAC is proud to bring high-quality housing to Oklahoma City, which will create long-term access to affordable housing in one of the city’s most dynamic and growing areas,” said David Garcia, VP and project partner at LAC. “The Reserve at Chisholm Creek represents our continued commitment to building sustainable, inclusive communities, and we’re grateful to our public and private partners who helped make this project possible.”

Cool factor: The Reserve at Chisholm Creek will feature a mix of one-, two-, three-, and four-bedroom apartments with communal amenities including a swimming pool, playground, dog park, fitness center, and clubroom for resident gatherings. Units will feature stainless steel appliances, in-unit washers and dryers, and ample storage including coat and linen closets. The facility is LAC’s first ground-up construction project in the state of Oklahoma.

The Reserve at Chisholm Creek will lease its units to individuals and families earning up to 60% of the area median income (AMI). The development was financed with a 4% non-competitive Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), along with tax-exempt bonds and Oklahoma state low-income housing tax credits issued by Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency (OHFA). Chase Bank provided construction financing, Barings provided the permanent loan, and US Bank purchased the federal and state LIHTCs. Rosemann & Associates is the architect and CMS Willowbrook is the general contractor. The development will comply with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Oklahoma Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP).

ForeFront Power closes 9th fund for DG energy

ForeFront Power has closed its ninth distributed generation fund, including a debt financing package with a consortium of leading financial institutions. The deal includes a partial equity sell-down of a 95 MW distributed generation portfolio to an unnamed investor.

“ForeFront Power’s ninth fund builds on the best features of our prior transactions, closing efficiency, flexibility, and repeatability, along with a market-leading cost of capital from reliable investors and lenders,” said Bryan Eckstein, CFO at ForeFront Power.

Cool factor: The investment tax credits from the portfolio, which spans four U.S. states and more than 100 behind-the-meter solar energy and battery storage projects, are subject to a $210 million purchase commitment from a separate counterparty. The combined, undisclosed capital from the debt financing, the partial equity sell-down, and the $210 million tax credit sale will enable ForeFront to advance construction of its development pipeline over the next two years while deploying cash to support continued platform growth.

“Closing this fund provides the certainty and stability required for ongoing distributed energy resource development for our customers and our shared communities,” added Eckstein.

MUFG Bank, Ltd. acted as lead arranger and administrative agent for the debt financing, with participation from collateral agent Cadence Bank, and additional co-lenders Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank and Mitsubishi HC Capital America.

“At a time of growing energy needs and rising electricity rates, ForeFront Power is a national leader in helping private companies and public agencies control electricity spending and bolster energy security through behind-the-meter solar and storage technologies,” said Takaki Sakai, Managing Director at MUFG.

SolaREIT surpasses $5 billion project value milestone

SolaREIT has surpassed a major industry milestone, providing real estate financing for more than 3 GW of renewable energy projects valued at more than $5 billion. The milestone coincides with the company’s five-year anniversary, marking a period of rapid growth and impact in clean energy deployment.

“From our first $134,000 deal to supporting more than $5 billion in project value, SolaREIT’s growth shows what’s possible when you stay focused on providing solutions developers need,” said Laura Pagliarulo, CEO and cofounder of SolaREIT. “We’ve proven it at scale, 3+ GW and counting. We have the experience and know-how to partner efficiently with developers and deliver results, even in tough markets. I couldn’t be prouder of the team we’ve built and am grateful for our partners’ trust.”

Cool factor: SolaREIT’s financing solutions are designed specifically for solar and energy storage developers and asset owners looking to monetize land or lease value, reduce lease costs, or create liquidity for interconnection, equipment, and development expenses.

“SolaREIT’s growth over the past five years is a testament to our disciplined capital deployment and the power of our focused strategy,” said Laura Klein, CFO/COO of SolaREIT. “By financing the land that underpins renewable energy projects, we’re accelerating development timelines for developers and helping them free up critical project capital. Reaching this milestone so quickly underscores the strength of our model and the vital role SolaREIT plays in accelerating the nation’s transition to clean energy.”

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.
“This is more than just a manufacturing facility.
“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar.
Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company.","First Solar – an American company that manufactures and sells photovoltaic solar power systems, modules, and energy storage solutions – has inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana.

The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year.

Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s American manufacturing footprint to 14 GW in 2026, and 17.7 GW in 2027, when a recently announced production facility in South Carolina is expected to be fully ramped.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.

The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance.

The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry.

“This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4 percent in its first full year of operations at capacity.

Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar.

“By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar.

“Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California.

Last week, the company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet.

Altogether, the company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company.

It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.",https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-solar-iberia-parish-louisiana-1.png,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:56.769851

Global negotiations at the U.N. climate summit ended Saturday in Belém, Brazil, with a watered-down agreement that doesn’t include a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, oil, gas and coal — doesn’t even mention fossil fuels, the world’s largest contributors to the climate crisis. The final agreement went into overtime after two weeks of contentious negotiations in Belém, the gateway to the Amazon.

A coalition of more than 80 nations, from Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and U.K., had supported a just transition away from fossil fuels, but the efforts were derailed by petrostates, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as the more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists who were granted access to the climate talks this year. A fossil fuel phaseout was also a key demand by the thousands of Indigenous leaders who attended COP30.

This is Colombia’s environment minister, Irene Vélez Torres.

IRENE VÉLEZ TORRES: Particularly the oil-producing countries are only trying to focus on adaptation. But adaptation is an empty bag if mitigation doesn’t come next to adaptation. Adaptation alone and the finances for adaptation are not sufficient if we don’t deal with the problem.

The root cause of this problem is fossil fuels. How are we dealing with that? How are we going to come out from this COP to say and to tell the people that we deny the most basic scientific truth, which is that the fossil fuels are the cause of more than 80% of the emissions that are generating climate change? We cannot look at the people in the future generations if we don’t do something now. And we cannot accept a text that is not dealing with the real problems.

AMY GOODMAN: While in Belém, the governments of Colombia and the Netherlands announced they’d be co-hosting the first international conference on the just transition away from fossil fuels next year in Colombia. The landmark gathering will take place in the Colombian port city of Santa Marta in April.

The COP30 agreement also makes no new commitments to halt deforestation and doesn’t address global meat consumption, another major driver of global heating. More than 300 agribusiness lobbyists attended the climate talks in Belém as the expansion of industrial agriculture, including the production of soy, has led to worsening air pollution and deforestation in the Amazon.

This all comes as the Trump administration boycotted COP30 after the White House withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time when Trump returned to office.

We’re now joined by two guests. In Belém, Brazil, Jonathan Watts is with us, The Guardian’s global environment writer, usually based in Altamira, Brazil. And in Washington, D.C., Brandon Wu is the director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA, just returned from COP30 in Belém.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Jonathan, let’s begin with you. You’re right there in the gateway to the Amazon. You had a major piece with other Guardian writers summarizing what happened. Why don’t you do it for us here? What took place over these last two weeks? What agreement did it lead to? What didn’t it agree to? Would you call it a total failure or an incremental, very slow transition away — though they wouldn’t talk about transition away — from what some call the F-word, fossil fuels?

JONATHAN WATTS: The first thing I would say is that it’s not as bad as I expected. I had the lowest of expectations, which were almost realized. This COP conference came perilously close to breaking down. And if this had broken down, then the whole Paris Agreement, that’s put in place 10 years ago, could have collapsed. So this was a very dangerous moment.

And I don’t think we can understand what happened in Belém without looking at the terrible, terrible geopolitical situation. The absence of the United States was critical. The United States, of course, is the world’s biggest historical emitter and the richest country, the one that in past conferences has leaned on countries like Saudi Arabia to be a bit more giving. It wasn’t there, and President Donald Trump has been openly hostile to the whole multilateral, global environmental governance system. Then you have the wars. Then you have the fact that Europe is rearming. So, in this context, I think it’s amazing that anything came out of this.

Your summary is excellent, that this conference didn’t go — get anywhere near close enough to where we need to be going to keep global warming to a reasonably safe level of 1.5 C. All the scientists I talked to here — and that was something new about this conference, bringing in more scientists, as well as more Indigenous people — all the scientists here were incredibly alarmed. We’re approaching a number of tipping points with regards to the Amazon rainforest, with regards to Atlantic currents and so forth. So, yes, that’s frustrating, but that’s not new. Last year was a very similar outcome. This year, what I think there was — it’s really disappointing there was no mention of fossil fuels. But Saudi Arabia just said really clearly, if you talk about a roadmap and transition, these talks are going to collapse. So, it just wasn’t on the table.

But what we did see was the start of a new just transition mechanism, a tripling of funds, adaptation funds, for developing countries, and, more than anything else, a kind of a radicalism that’s come into the talks that wasn’t there before. It was there on the streets. For the first time in four years, civil society was out in force, amazing color, dynamism, flotillas in the bay, tens of thousands of people in the streets, more Indigenous people in the conference than ever before. That was incredibly encouraging. So was the fact that, as you mentioned, Colombia and a group of other high ambition nations have decided to go it alone and create a parallel series of conferences for a just transition away from fossil fuels. That’s really going on the offensive.

And then, finally, kind of in the background of all of this was China and what’s happening in China with its fossil fuel shift away — sorry, a shift away from fossil fuels, incredibly, incredible ramp up of wind, solar, electric cars, that is transforming the world. Despite what the talks do achieve or don’t achieve, it’s absolutely incredible how fast things are moving in that area. So, it seems, from where I’m sitting, that the United States under Donald Trump is trying to go backwards to the 20th century in a fossil fuel era, whereas a huge part of the rest of the world wants to move forward into something else. So, yes, I wish there was much, much more on the table here, but given everything that’s happening in the world right now, the whole process lives to fight another day.

AMY GOODMAN: You talk about the role of China. I want to bring in Brandon Wu. China and the United States. You’ve just returned from Belém, flew in to Washington, D.C. If you can talk about the significance of the U.S.? So, you don’t say the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and UAE and other countries blocked the final declaration mentioning fossil fuels, but that’s only because the U.S. boycotted. So, the significance of this? And did you expect that China would more fill the vacuum, as it becomes a leader in the production of renewable energy technology?

BRANDON WU: Yeah, China’s role in this, in all this, is extremely interesting. You know, let’s talk about that.

I actually want to back up a moment and say I’m extremely angry, right? I’m angry at a really weak outcome. I’m angry at the fossil fuel lobbyists roaming the venue freely, while the Indigenous activists, that both of you have mentioned, were actually met with militarized repression. I’m angry at all the governments that aren’t standing up for their people.

But I have a special level of incandescent outrage at a particular set of countries, and it’s actually a slightly different set than the one that we’re naming so far, and that is the rich, developed countries of the Global North, who come in to these conferences, and they act like they’re the heroes, when, in fact, what they’re doing is shifting the burden of a crisis that they caused onto the backs of the poor.

So, you have — of course, you have the United States, but also the European Union, which was part of this so-called high ambition coalition pushing a fossil fuel roadmap. They are not on track in any way to phase out fossil fuels themselves. At this point, 10 years after the Paris Agreement, the countries of the Global North should be pretty close to near-zero emissions. None of them are anywhere close to that. And so, to come in and to push a fossil fuel roadmap, you know, it strikes as a little bit hypocritical. Of course, we need a fossil fuel phaseout. We need it as fast as possible. But it has to start in the Global North, and the Global North has to provide the finance to the Global South to enable that to happen.

That is part of what China is doing, frankly. China is also doing some unhelpful stuff, you know, continuing investment in coal, but they are also investing in renewables in a way that the Global North just isn’t doing at scale, and that’s what’s undermining trust in the agreement. That’s why countries, like most of Africa, not just Saudi Arabia and Russia, were opposed to the fossil fuel roadmap in Belém, because they had no assurance that the Global North would be moving first or would be providing support for them to have a transition.

AMY GOODMAN: Brandon Wu, when you talk about adaptation, it’s become a buzzword. Everyone understands it at the U.N. climate summit, but outside of that, I don’t think people really get it. Explain what you mean by funding adaptation.

BRANDON WU: So, adaptation is really just supporting communities to be resilient to climate impacts. Climate impacts are not — you know, we all know climate impacts are not something that’s going to happen in the future. It’s happening now. It’s been happening for decades, particularly in the most vulnerable countries in the Global South. Many of those communities had zero contribution to the climate crisis, but they’re the ones that are feeling the brunt of its harmful effects. And they need to be supported with resources to be able to adapt to those impacts. That’s what we’re talking about when we talk about adaptation finance.

And again, it’s the wealthy countries of the Global North, that have caused this crisis, that are responsible for providing that support. We did get a tripling, in theory, of adaptation finance at this COP. But if you look at the actual text, it’s really ambiguous. So, the developed countries, led by the EU, they took out the baseline. It was supposed to be adaptation tripling from 2025 levels by 2030. They took out the baseline, so now it doesn’t reference 2025 levels, so we’re not sure what we’re tripling from. And they pushed the deadline from 2030 to 2035, 10 years from now. That’s like an interminable amount of time for communities that are facing the brunt of the impacts right now.

AMY GOODMAN: Are you calling for a ban on fossil fuel lobbyists —

BRANDON WU: Yes, absolutely.

AMY GOODMAN: — at the U.N. climate summit?

BRANDON WU: Absolutely. You know, we can criticize this process in any number of different ways. It’s been 30 years. It hasn’t delivered what we need. A big part of that is the presence, as you say, of fossil fuel lobbyists at this talk. So, it’s fossil fuel lobbyists. It’s intransigent Global North governments. And part of the reason that they’re so intransigent is those fossil fuel lobbyists that have their ears. So, yes, absolutely, they do not belong at talks that are designed to solve the climate crisis, which means getting rid of fossil fuels altogether.

AMY GOODMAN: If you can talk — if you can talk, Brandon, about the Belém Declaration? I want to get Jonathan’s view on this, as well. So, on the one hand, you have the COP30 not mentioning fossil fuels. But I think what Lula will focus on, the Brazilian president, as he did as he headed to G20 and was there this weekend, was what’s called the Belém Declaration. Explain that.

BRANDON WU: So, the Belém Declaration is, essentially, a coalition of countries that want to, or at least say they want to, move on fossil fuels and are frustrated with the U.N. climate negotiations, because it is a consensus-based process, and so you can have individual countries blocking progress. And so, they want to take something outside of this process and move forward on phasing out fossil fuels with a sort of coalition of the willing, if I can use that term. And so, this is a genuinely exciting development. This is the kind of energy that we need. You know, we need all the initiatives we can get to phase out fossil fuels and, I might add, to stop deforestation. That’s sort of the second part of this, that you have, thankfully, mentioned, but that a lot of people forget about — phase out fossil fuels and stop deforestation. And we need all the initiatives they can get — we can get. And so, the fact that they’ve started something outside the COP, you know, that is an exciting development.

I’m glad also that Jonathan mentioned the exciting development also that came within the COP process, which is the conversation on just transition. This is about how do we actually have a transition from a fossil fuel-based economy that doesn’t leave communities and workers and ordinary people behind. We did have some incremental progress on that at this COP, which mitigates an otherwise very bad outcome. And I don’t think we would have gotten that outcome if the U.S. had been there.

AMY GOODMAN: Jonathan Watts, you mentioned the large presence of Indigenous people. I think nearly a thousand were accredited. Thousands more were outside, though there was serious repression of those that tried to go from the outside in. Last Friday, the Indigenous leaders actually shut down the COP for a few hours. But I want to talk about the dangers Indigenous people and their allies face, who are land defenders, who are water defenders. You are an editor of the book — and I went to a bookstore in Belém last week, where you, as well as others, spoke — How to Save the Amazon, a book by Dom Phillips, The Guardian reporter. At one point, I think, he was a Guardian reporter, who was murdered, together with the Brazilian Bruno Pereira, when they were investigating what was happening in the Amazon. If you can talk about the dangers people face? And then I’d like to make my way into what’s happening with Bolsonaro right now and how he enabled so much of this, a man who’s about to go to prison, who President Trump has defended, the former president of Brazil. But start with the dangers people face.

JONATHAN WATTS: Sure. Something like 200 environmental land defenders are killed around the world every year. It’s an incredible toll. It’s the toll of a war. And this is a war against nature.

Dom Phillips, who worked for The Guardian, but he was a freelancer also for The Washington Post and many other organizations, he wanted to write a book where he asked as many people as possible how to save the Amazon, so from a position of great humility, to try to understand. He found out just how dangerous it was, when he was traveling with an Indigenous expert called Bruno Pereira, who is Brazilian, who had worked for the government, worked with Indigenous people for a long time, and he was targeted and killed. Dom witnessed it and paid the price. This case got a lot of attention because Dom had a lot of journalist friends, because — frankly, because he was from the Global North. But these kind of cases are happening all the time. It’s often unreported. Very often it’s Indigenous people who are killed.

And going back to the conference a little, there was this kind of contradiction. There were more Indigenous people inside than ever before, including Brazil has for the first time got an Indigenous minister, and many senior Indigenous leaders were in the Blue Zone, the main negotiating area. But they weren’t there for the final talks. And that’s something that really needs to change, so that the people on the frontline, the people who know the forest best and other biomes best, are represented and their voices are heard when these kinds of decisions are made.

AMY GOODMAN: And we’re going to do another show on How to Save the Amazon, this book that has just come out. But I wanted to ask Brandon Wu, as you come back from Belém, where you think global movements to deal with the climate catastrophe are headed. And the significance of this Colombia meeting that’s happening in just months from now, the leadership of Petro, the president of Colombia? They’re going to be doing it in conjunction with, sponsoring it, of a country of the North, of the Netherlands. Talk about the signficance of that.

BRANDON WU: I think this is really important. I think Colombia’s initiative, President Petro’s initiative, on this has been really admirable. And I also think that none of this is going to happen unless there is more ambition and more finance coming from the big Global North countries, including the United States. Obviously, the political situation is difficult. Politics are difficult everywhere.

But here in the United States, you know, I think what Trump has done over the past year has really shown that the line we’ve heard from the U.S. and other rich countries over the past 30 years in these negotiations, which is that we don’t have the money to give to the Global South to enable a worldwide transition away from fossil fuels, that’s just a lie. Right? We have been fighting tooth and nail for $100 billion a year, which was the original goal for climate money flowing from Global North to Global South. It’s now $300 billion, is the new goal. It’s still far too little. But, you know, the response from the U.S. and the EU has been “We just don’t have the money.” But this year, we saw the Trump administration just sort of magic up $200 billion for ICE and CBP, right? We have consistently magicked up lots of money for Israel. Our military budget is nearing a trillion dollars. We subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. It’s just not true that the money isn’t there. And I think it’s actually quite useful that this administration is showing how muth of a lie that is.

And so, in answer to your response about the role of movements, you know, I think our movements, especially in those wealthy developed countries, really have to lean on our governments to show how the money is there. It’s just the political will that’s not, and it’s up to us to change that.

AMY GOODMAN: And I want to end by asking about former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Jonathan. He was just arrested this weekend after there was evidence that he tampered with his ankle monitor while under house arrest, the arrest ordered by the Brazilian Supreme Court Justice de Moraes over fears that he would, Bolsonaro would, attempt to escape his compound days before he was headed to a 27-year prison term, back in September sentenced to that for plotting a military coup and assassination against Brazil’s current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Can you talk about the significance of what happened? His son was calling for Brazilians to rally at the compound and to fight. It was feared, in the chaos, he might escape to, what, the U.S. Embassy there or the Argentine Embassy there. Why don’t you summarize the significance of this moment, even in terms of climate change?

JONATHAN WATTS: This is hugely, hugely important. We are — we are in a battle around the world between those who want to keep the world habitable and those who want to just exploit it until there’s nothing left. And Brazil is one of the frontline states. The Global South is bearing the brunt of this. The Global North absolutely has more responsibility and should be doing a lot more. And it’s politicians on the far right, of which Bolsonaro, Jair Bolsonaro, is one of the figureheads, at least in Latin America, that are pushing forward this extractivist agenda, come what may. This leads them, very often, towards authoritarianism. And we’re now seeing that, of course, in the United States, as well.

And so, I think it’s hugely significant that the Brazilian courts stepped up, intervened and have put Jair Bolsonaro behind bars. And what’s really important is it’s not just Jair Bolsonaro. Several of Brazil’s top military generals have also been sentenced. And this is so historical. It was only — it was up until 1985, Brazil had a military dictatorship. And after that, there was a kind of an amnesty, let’s not [inaudible] —

AMY GOODMAN: Thirty seconds.

JONATHAN WATTS: Sorry?

AMY GOODMAN: We have 30 seconds.

JONATHAN WATTS: Oh, OK. Just look, it’s really important that when people break the rules, they’re punished for it, and that someone like Jair Bolsonaro, who, while he was president, oversaw the greatest destruction of the Amazon in any recent presidency, it’s great that he’s not above the law, that there isn’t impunity. But there will be a fight back. You can be sure this is not over.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/28/79928/full_hd/COP302.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 14:01:14.255789

Imagine an all-electric supercar that hits 60 mph in under two seconds, then lifts off the pavement like something out of The Jetsons. It sounds impossible, even absurd. But during a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk hinted that the long-delayed Tesla Roadster is about to do the unthinkable: merge supercar speed with vertical takeoff.

As someone who’s test-driven nearly every kind of machine on four (and sometimes fewer) wheels, I’ve seen hype before. But this time, it’s not just marketing spin. Tesla’s preparing a prototype demo that could change how we think about personal transportation — or prove that even Elon Musk can aim too high.

The Rogan reveal: A Roadster built to defy gravity

On Halloween, Musk told Joe Rogan that Tesla is “getting close to demonstrating the prototype,” adding with his usual flair:

“This will be one thing I can guarantee: this product demo will be unforgettable.”

Rogan, always the skeptic, pushed for details. Wings? Hovering? Musk smirked:

“I can’t do the unveil before the unveil. But it has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.”

He even invoked his friend and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who once said, “We were promised flying cars, and all we got was 140 characters.” Musk’s response: “If Peter wants a flying car, he should be able to buy one.”

That’s classic Elon—part visionary, part showman. But underneath the bravado lies serious engineering. Musk hinted at SpaceX technology powering the car: “rockety stuff” using cold-gas thrusters for short bursts or hovering capability. Think less “wings and propellers,” more “controlled rocket push.”

The demonstration, now scheduled for April 1, 2026 (yes, April Fools’ Day), is meant to prove the impossible. Production could start by 2027 or 2028, but given Tesla’s history of optimistic timelines, it may be longer before any of us see a flying Roadster on the road—or in the air.

Why now? Tesla needs a headline

Tesla’s timing isn’t accidental. The company’s Q3 2025 profits fell short due to tariffs, R&D spending, and the loss of federal EV tax credits. With electric vehicle demand cooling, Musk knows how to recapture attention: promise something audacious.

Remember the Cybertruck’s “unbreakable” windows? The demo didn’t go as planned—but it worked as a publicity move. A flying Tesla Roadster could do the same, turning investor eyes (and wallets) back toward Tesla’s most thrilling frontier.

The tech behind the hype

So, can a Tesla actually fly? Musk’s “SpaceX package” may use cold-gas thrusters—essentially small rocket nozzles that expel compressed air for brief, powerful thrusts. The result could be hovering, extreme acceleration, or even short hops over obstacles.

There’s also talk of “fan car” technology, inspired by 1970s race cars that used vacuum fans to suck the car to the track for impossible cornering speeds. Combine that with Tesla’s AI-driven Full Self-Driving systems and new battery packs designed for over 600 miles of range, and the idea starts to sound just plausible enough.

The challenge? Energy density. Vertical flight consumes enormous power, and even Tesla’s advanced 4680 cells may struggle to deliver it without sacrificing range. And if the Roadster truly hovers, it’ll need reinforced suspension, stability controls, and noise-dampening tech to keep your driveway from turning into a launchpad.

The flying car dream: A century in the making

Musk isn’t the first to chase this dream. The “flying car” has tempted inventors since the 1910s—and disappointed them nearly as long.

In the optimistic 1950s, Ford’s Advanced Design Studio built the Volante Tri-Athodyne, a ducted-fan prototype that looked ready for takeoff but never left the ground. The Moulton Taylor Aerocar actually flew, cruising at 120 mph and folding its wings for the highway—but only five were ever built.

Even the military tried. The U.S. and Canadian armies funded the Avrocar, a flying saucer-style VTOL craft that could hover but not climb more than six feet. Every generation since has produced new attempts—from the AVE Mizar (a flying Ford Pinto that ended in tragedy) to today’s eVTOL startups like Joby and Alef Aeronautics, the latter already FAA-certified for testing.

The dream keeps coming back because it represents freedom — freedom from traffic, limits, and gravity itself.

The FAA factor: Can you even fly it?

Here’s where reality checks in. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) now classifies eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft) under a new category requiring both airplane and helicopter training. You’d need a pilot’s license, medical exams, and specialized instruction to legally take off.

Insurance? Astronomical. Airspace? Restricted. Maintenance? Complex. In short, this won’t replace your daily driver anytime soon. Even if the Roadster hovers, the FAA isn’t handing out flight permits for your morning commute.

Safety first—Or it should be

Flying cars sound thrilling until you consider what happens when one malfunctions. A blown tire is one thing; a blown thruster at 200 feet is another. Tesla’s autonomy might help mitigate pilot error, but weather, visibility, and battery reliability all pose major challenges.

NASA and the FAA are developing new air traffic systems to handle “urban air mobility,” but even best-case scenarios involve strict flight corridors, automated control, and years of testing.

In short: we’re closer than ever to a flying car—but not that close.

Genius or gimmick?

So, will the Tesla Roadster really fly? Probably—at least for a few seconds. Will it transform personal transportation? Not yet.

But here’s the thing: Musk doesn’t have to deliver a mass-market flying car. He just has to prove it’s possible. And that may be enough to reignite public imagination and investor faith at a time when both are fading for the EV industry.

If the April 2026 demo delivers even a glimpse of flight, it’ll cement Tesla’s image as the company that still dares to dream big. If it flops, it’ll join the long list of “flying car” fantasies that fell back to Earth.

Either way, we’ll be watching—because when Elon Musk says he’s going to make a car fly, the world can’t help but look up.

The Georgia Department of Transportation announced that the State Transportation Board approved a $24.4 million grant for the project. The funding is part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program, a $5 billion initiative under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to expand EV charging networks nationwide, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.

The expansion will serve both urban and rural communities, targeting gaps identified in earlier efforts. GDOT has partnered with six private companies to design, install, finance, operate, and maintain the new stations, which will include Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) ports for at least five years, allowing faster vehicle charging. Governor Brian P. Kemp noted that Georgia’s infrastructure network supports business, travel, and reliable transportation for residents.

The new charging stations will each include four DCFC ports that can operate at the same time and will be available 24/7. Charging times will vary by vehicle, with some able to fully recharge in as little as 20 minutes. The stations will be built in counties across Georgia, from Atkinson to Worth, expanding the state’s EV charging network and supporting greater electric vehicle adoption.

The initiative aims to improve access for electric vehicle drivers and aligns with Georgia’s plans to strengthen its position in innovation and infrastructure. Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell R. McMurry told the Cobb County Courier that the state is investing in infrastructure to enhance the transportation network, support economic development, and improve the experience for EV drivers.

GDOT has not provided a detailed timeline for the new charging stations, which are part of ongoing efforts to expand EV infrastructure in the state.

Presented at DTECH Northeast on November 19th, 2025, the 2025 Grid Changers Awards ceremony recognized this year’s top innovators. The following is a transcript from the event featuring the opening remarks and details about the recipients.

Everyone in this room understands the incredible expectations and challenges that define this entire sector. Keeping the lights on while simultaneously navigating an energy transition unlike any we’ve ever seen is no small task, but it’s one that all of you have embraced in ways that are literally powering the world. No matter how big or small, just about everything in front of us as a society and civilization needs to be powered, which arguably makes this industry more critical than any other.

Every day, you’re battling evolving challenges, which include ever-increasing demand shifts and sorting out what grid resilience needs to look like in the face of extreme weather. This work needs to be about more than incremental improvements and instead serve as a fundamental shift in how we approach transmission and distribution.

Today, we’re here to celebrate the people and projects who are doing exactly that. These are innovators who aren’t just talking about the “grid of the future” but are deploying the practical solutions that are driving tangible value. By spotlighting these efforts, we’re creating essential blueprints for the entire utility sector. These projects will become case studies that accelerate adoption and enable stakeholders to share best practices, ensuring that today’s breakthrough becomes tomorrow’s standard operating procedures.

Additionally, in an age where public trust is paramount, we need to spread the word about all of the efforts we’re making to positively impact affordability issues that are top of mind for customers across the nation. Highlighting such achievements with awards like this is how we communicate to ratepayers and the communities being served that their utilities are making smart and strategic investments to ensure those lights stay on, no matter what.

These are people who are making a difference. These are projects that are defining a path forward for the entire sector. These are the DTECH Grid Changers.

For our Grid Pioneer of the Year, we’re excited to recognize the visionary leadership that is essential for modernizing the backbone of our system. The greatest threat to reliability often lies in managing nearly century-old infrastructure, which is why we’re thrilled to award this honor to Ryan Hawthorne, Vice President of Engineering at Central Hudson Gas & Electric.

Ryan’s team spearheaded the H&SB Transmission Project, which is a multi-phase rebuild of a 23.6-mile electric transmission line that was originally commissioned in 1928. This was more than simple maintenance, as it represents a complete transformation of the system and infrastructure. By replacing the old lattice towers and wires with steel poles while also significantly increasing the line’s voltage capacity, the project delivered an incredible increase in electric service reliability and storm hardening for the whole region.

As we heard during our panel, strategic foresight can be the difference between a good idea and real project that creates value. Ryan’s thinking and leadership helped the team and organization overcome the technical, regulatory, and logistical inertia associated with large-scale capital projects, which enabled his team to provide a critical and durable upgrade to the grid. His forward-thinking approach is one that countless others can learn from, as it has compelled necessary changes to aging assets that simultaneously future-proof the entire system.

Please join us in congratulating Ryan Hawthorne!

For our Grid Project of the Year, foundational work that is de-risking and accelerating the deployment of the next generation of Grid Enhancing Technologies caught the attention of our judges and community. The winner is the Advanced Grid Innovation Laboratory for Energy, or AGILe.

AGILe is a state-of-the-art power systems laboratory that provides an essential tool for the entire utility industry and has essentially created a “digital twin” of New York’s electric grid. It’s actually more than that though, as it’s not a simulation but is instead a high-fidelity, real-time operating environment that allows engineers to test and rigorously model the integration of new technologies, complex control schemes, and software updates in a virtual, real-time environment. That they’re able to do all of this without ever risking the stability of the live grid makes all the difference to stakeholders and to customers across the region.

By providing a safe, accelerated sandbox for innovation, AGILe drastically shortens R&D cycles for technologies like distributed energy resource management (DERMS), microgrids, and advanced protection systems. This project is a foundational asset that allows utilities to rapidly de-risk the implementation of advanced solutions, moving innovation from the drawing board to the control room faster than ever before.

Please join us in congratulating the entire AGILe team as well as Victor Daldegan Paduani, Ph.D., Manager at AGILe, who is here to accept the award.

Oregonians have just more than a month to take advantage of federal tax credits meant to reduce by thousands of dollars the costs of buying and installing new energy efficient heating and cooling pumps, insulation, windows and solar panels.

Paired with incentives from the nonprofit, state-partnered Energy Trust of Oregon, the savings can cover half to nearly all costs, depending on the purchase. People who have made home energy efficiency upgrades this year, or who can complete upgrades by Dec. 31, can claim the federal tax credits.

To claim federal tax credits:

Keep receipts from your purchase and submit an IRS form 5695 (Residential Energy Credits form) when you file your federal taxes for 2025. For more info go here.

Most of the federal credits passed in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted under former President Joe Biden and were meant to expire in 2032, giving Americans a decade to take advantage of subsidies meant to spur investments in home weatherizing and clean energy upgrades. But congressional Republicans phased the credits out early in the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

Julianne Thacher, a spokesperson for the Energy Trust, said the organization wants to encourage Oregonians to take advantage of those credits now and to remind them that when they go away, there will still be state-level incentives they should not overlook.

“Energy Trust incentives will be here after the tax credits. We won’t be affected. We were here before the tax credits, and had very successful programs with folks installing energy-efficient equipment, so we expect that will continue,” Thacher said.

The Oregon Department of Energy also offers solar and heat pump cash incentives and grants that can be used towards the costs of equipment and installation after federal, Energy Trust and any other incentives are applied.

The Oregon Energy Trust was established by the state Public Utilities Commission in 2002. Although it’s an independent nonprofit, the commission oversees the trust’s performance measures, budget and planning.

Ratepayers of five of Oregon’s six investor-owned gas and electric utilities — all except Idaho Power — fund the trust. As part of utilities’ energy load planning, they send a percentage of ratepayer dollars to the trust, which is tasked with ensuring investment in activities that lower overall load demand and help meet state climate targets.

Part of that is standing up cash incentive programs to help businesses and everyday Oregonians afford equipment and infrastructure to lower their own energy consumption. The trust offers higher incentives for families with lower incomes and collaborates with 60 community organizations statewide.

The mix of state, federal and private and nonprofit subsidies for solar panels have led to major growth in residential solar in the last decade, and today about 25,000 homeowners in Oregon are generating solar energy, according to Energy Trust. This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.

“The solar contractors we work with are very busy right now, and we’ve actually gone ahead and launched our new incentives for 2026 early, because folks who are looking to do a solar project starting now, they’re highly unlikely to complete that by year’s end. That’ll be a 2026 project.”

Focusing on efficiency in businesses and homes in Oregon, and setting climate targets that incorporate more solar, heat and cooling pumps and building upgrades, has made a big dent in Oregon’s gas and electricity use. Demand for gas would today be 9% higher and demand for electricity 16% higher if policies had not been enacted over the last two decades, the Trust found.

“Energy efficiency is the most effective, affordable way to meet climate goals, while also offering a ton of other benefits for customers and communities,” Thacher said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/oregon_capital_chronicle_articles_871/407aa7564133829691250d54a9af8c03,N,,2025-11-24 11:03:56.834583

Our partnership with Nest Health is bringing a proven, whole-family model into homes across Maricopa County and rural Mohave County, where limited provider access makes this care especially impactful.
Together we are connecting medical, behavioral, and social care to improve health and equity for families.”","Nest Health has closed its Series A funding round at more than $22.5 million as the Louisiana-based provider of whole-family Medicaid care positions itself for its next stage of product development and multistate growth. The company, which delivers medical, behavioral, and social care directly into the home, has gained meaningful traction among families facing barriers to traditional care as well as among payers seeking improved outcomes and reduced costs.

Nest Health’s new investor lineup includes Socium Ventures, a venture and growth investment firm backed by Cox Enterprises, along with Amboy Street Ventures, Impact America Fund, Hopelab, University Growth Fund, and Luminary Impact Fund. Socium Ventures will also take a seat on the company’s board of directors. The fresh capital will support the expansion of Nest’s clinical offerings, increased use of artificial intelligence to streamline care team efficiency, and geographic growth across both current and future payer partnerships.

Founded to address the persistent gaps in Medicaid access for mothers, fathers, children, and postpartum women, Nest Health provides a comprehensive in-home model that integrates primary care, behavioral health, substance use treatment, social support, specialist coordination, virtual care, and 24/7 clinical access. The company leverages AI to automate administrative and clinical workflows, supporting care teams during and after patient interactions.

Nest Health’s outcomes in Louisiana and Arizona indicate significant performance improvements. Families in the program have demonstrated a two-to-one return on investment for payer partners. The company’s net promoter score is +98. Nest reaches three-quarters of families for whom health plans previously lacked accurate contact information. Participants have shown a sixty percent reduction in emergency room utilization after enrolling. Payer churn has dropped by more than half, to 55%. Vaccination rates in Louisiana have doubled relative to state targets, and in Arizona, sixty-two percent of Nest patients who received a flu shot this season had not received one the year prior.

The company’s expansion continues with new and existing partners that are turning to in-home care models to improve equity and stability for high-risk families. Nest Health leadership emphasizes the importance of the home environment in shaping long-term health trajectories and sees the latest funding round as validation of its technology-enabled, family-centered approach.

KEY QUOTES

“Getting to one doctor, let alone five doctors, can be overwhelming for so many families. Partnering with Nest aligns with our mission to support innovative models that address real challenges. Nest has demonstrated that bringing care directly into the home can help improve health outcomes and cost savings. The team’s unique combination of clinical acumen and technology expertise positions them to scale this impact nationwide. We are proud to support this growth phase, and together we look forward to creating meaningful change in the healthcare system.”

Tim Howe, Partner, Socium Ventures

This shift introduces alternative fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, biofuels, and electric, wind, and nuclear power—each presenting unique advantages, disadvantages, challenges and risks for spill and safety hazards. On September 16, 2025, NOAA’s Mid-Atlantic Scientific Support Coordinator participated in an alternative fuels tabletop exercise hosted by the U.S. Coast Guard Sector Delaware Bay in Clarksboro, NJ. The goal of the exercise was to serve as an introduction to the various alternative fuels; identify response and training priorities; discuss recommendations for engaging with the maritime industry’s “safety by design” process; and develop tactical response plans. Unlike traditional oil, these fuels require specialized emergency protocols. For example, LNG and hydrogen are both cryogenic and pose risks of fire and explosion, cryogenic burns, and asphyxiation from rapid evaporation. Methanol is water-soluble and highly flammable, meaning it cannot be contained by traditional booming methods. Ammonia is toxic to humans and marine life; a major release risk is the formation of a harmful vapor cloud. Battery fires are difficult to extinguish, and leaks can release flammable vapors. The exercise included presentations by NOAA OR&R on the current status of alternative fuels, technology readiness, bunkering safety, and operational risks. James E. Elliott, a retired Coast Guard expert and current leader in worldwide marine salvage and emergency response operations, provided an overview of the U.S. National Contingency Plan, the Marine Salvage Regulatory Framework, and policy recommendations. Participants included numerous federal agencies (Coast Guard, NOAA, Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Army Corps of Engineers); state representatives from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland; maritime industries; and non-governmental organizations. This interagency effort successfully identified a unified set of critical needs and goals, establishing a clear framework for action centered on stabilizing incidents and swiftly initiating defensive measures to protect life and the environment.

The NOAA Southeast and Caribbean Regional Collaboration Team (SECART) has released an updated “Guide to Integrated NOAA Disaster Resilience in the Southeast and Caribbean,” commonly known as the “Disaster Guide.” The original guide, published in 2022, was created following feedback from disaster-themed workshops SECART hosted between 2017 and 2019. Participants consistently noted the need for a resource summarizing NOAA’s roles, responsibilities, and resources for disaster preparation, response, recovery and mitigation in the region. The Guide’s purpose is to improve communication and coordination among NOAA offices and partners in disaster management in the Southeast and Caribbean region. Based on user feedback, Version 2 features several improvements: updated contact information for key NOAA personnel involved in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery; a more streamlined presentation of NOAA contacts and resources supporting disaster resilience efforts, and a Spanish-language version to better serve partners and communities. Access the updated Guide and related resources on SECART’s disaster resilience website.

The funds they’re referencing are part of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, a program that helps finance infrastructure projects that allow states to stay in compliance with federal water quality regulations.
“Cities and towns have prepared bids, identified contractors, and engaged residents, yet cannot move forward until the EPA finalizes state allotments.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that passed in 2021 included $15 billion over five years to help replace lead pipes.
Since 2022, the state has allocated more than $102 million in grants to help municipalities replace lead water service lines.","LET IT FLOW — A grant program that would help cities and towns in Massachusetts replace lead pipes is still on pause. Sen. Ed Markey is trying to get the funding flowing again.

“It’s long past time for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to get the lead out — both literally and figuratively — when it comes to water service lines,” Markey and members of the state’s congressional delegation wrote in a letter they’re sending this morning to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The funds they’re referencing are part of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, a program that helps finance infrastructure projects that allow states to stay in compliance with federal water quality regulations. Massachusetts pressed pause on distributing funds from the program in October, after the EPA delayed announcing the grants.

The wait “has real consequences, particularly in states such as Massachusetts that have some of the oldest water infrastructure in the nation,” reads the letter, which all 11 members of the delegation signed onto.

“Cities and towns have prepared bids, identified contractors, and engaged residents, yet cannot move forward until the EPA finalizes state allotments. Timely release of these funds will allow states to maintain construction momentum, protect public health, and adhere to the statutory mandate in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” the letter says.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that passed in 2021 included $15 billion over five years to help replace lead pipes. In past years, the money has been divided among states and distributed in the spring, but even as funding for other water projects has been delivered, Massachusetts is still waiting to see these funds start flowing.

The program in the past has meant grants for 160 cities and towns in the state, Gov. Maura Healey’s office said in October. Since 2022, the state has allocated more than $102 million in grants to help municipalities replace lead water service lines.

DATELINE BEACON HILL

— Massachusetts agencies never followed a 2017 rule to cut emissions from state vehicles, court documents show by Jordan Wolman, CommonWealth Beacon: “No agency submitted reports to comply with a 2017 rule requiring cuts to the emissions produced by state-owned vehicles — and environmental regulators didn’t aggressively enforce the rule, either, according to new court documents filed last week. Massachusetts agencies that own or lease at least 30 passenger vehicles, from the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Department of Transportation, are compelled to reduce the pollution stemming from that vehicle fleet each year by specific amounts and submit reports to the Department of Environmental Protection in order to show compliance.”

FROM THE HUB

— Mayor Wu and cellist Yo-Yo Ma perform together at Boston’s Symphony Hallby Darin Zullo, Boston.com: “Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma shared the stage Friday night at Symphony Hall for a duet. Wu joined Ma to perform ‘Ave Maria,’ an 1853 piece by French composer Charles Gounod based upon German composer Johann Sebastian Bach’s ‘Prelude No. 1.’ Ma’s concert, which consisted of six unaccompanied cello suites inspired by Bach, was held as part of the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s Celebrity Series.”

— Video shows BPS bus driver’s eyes were off the road when Hyde Park kindergartner was struck and killed in April crash by John Hilliard, The Boston Globe: “The driver of a Boston Public Schools bus that struck and killed a Hyde Park kindergartner in April was seemingly not looking straight ahead at the road when the vehicle ran over the boy, according to a video recording viewed by the Globe. That recording shows the driver did not appear to be watching the boy, 5-year-old Lens Arthur Joseph, and his 11-year-old cousin after they disembarked from the bus the afternoon of April 28. He also does not appear to watch where they were going as the pair crossed in front of the vehicle to reach their family’s home.”

FROM HARVARD YARD

— Student petition urges Harvard to revoke Larry Summers’ tenure by Spencer Buell, The Boston Globe: “Amid new scrutiny of the relationship former Harvard University president Larry Summers had with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, some students are calling on the institution to do something it rarely does: revoke Summers’ tenure. Summers last week said he was immediately stepping back from teaching duties at the university while it investigates his ties to the late Epstein. That probe comes after the release by a congressional committee of emails that showed the two men shared messages until Epstein’s arrest in 2019. Summers has said he regrets the correspondence. Now, some on campus are saying the university should do more to keep him away from students permanently.”

ON THE STUMP

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — State Rep. Hannah Kane is endorsing former Housing and Economic Development Secretary Mike Kennealy in the race for governor, per Kennealy’s campaign.

“I came to know Mike during his service in the Baker-Polito administration, and I know he is the only one in the Republican primary that can win a general election,” Kane, a Shrewsbury Republican, said in a statement. “We must nominate Mike, with his track record of delivering for the people of Massachusetts, to win in 2026 and put Massachusetts on a better path forward—rooted in common sense, fiscal responsibility, and results-driven leadership.”

ALSO FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — The Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts is endorsing Sen. Ed Markey for reelection, according to his campaign.

Markey has “a long history of standing with firefighters and working families,” PFFM President Rich MacKinnon Jr. said in a statement shared by Markey’s campaign. “From leading the fight to repeal the unfair WEP provision, to holding chemical companies accountable for putting cancer-causing PFAS in our gear, to calling out venture capital firms driving up the cost and wait times of fire apparatus, he’s never been afraid to take on the tough fights.”

WATCH — John Deaton talks Senate campaign, working with Trump and ICE in Massachusetts. via NBC10 Boston.

DAY IN COURT

— Federal judge asked to strike down firearm age restrictions by Christian M. Wade, The Eagle-Tribune: “A coalition of gun rights groups are asking a federal judge to strike down Massachusetts’ ban on the sale of handguns to anyone age 18 to 20 in response to a federal appeals court ruling that overturned a federal ban. In a filing in U.S. District Court, the Las Vegas-based Firearms Policy Coalition and other groups ask the judge to grant an injunction blocking the state’s age-based prohibitions from being enforced. The groups argue that the 18-20 age group is protected by the Second Amendment and that there is “historical tradition” supporting the states restrictions.”

FROM THE 413

— ‘There will be more encampments’: Trump’s HUD guts $91M for supportive housing across Mass., U.S. by Jim Kinney, The Springfield Republican: “The Trump administration, in a major policy shift in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, is capping the money that grant recipients around the country can spend ‘housing first’ programs, like permanent supportive housing, and instead emphasizing shelters. In housing first sites, sobriety is not a prerequisite, as advocates say shelter is needed before recovery, job hunting and mental health treatment. Here, the shift endangers $9 million in federal funding for the Springfield-Hampden County Continuum of Care, said Geraldine McCafferty, director of housing for the city of Springfield.”

— Berkshire renters confront rent increases with no state limits in place by Nate Harrington, The Berkshire Eagle: “After a law was passed in preventing rent control in 1994, there have been no protections against rent hikes in Massachusetts. This has resulted in tenants having to leave apartments they’ve stayed in for decades, but lawmakers say there might be a change coming.”

THE LOCAL ANGLE

— By razor thin margin Taunton Council votes not to discipline McCaul by Emma Rindlisbacher, Taunton Daily Gazette: “The Taunton City Council ultimately voted in a close 5-4 vote not to take any disciplinary action against Councilor John McCaul — other than asking him to apologize to an election worker — in the wake of allegations from Elections Director Mark Pacheco that McCaul ‘singlehandedly delayed results for the City’s entire election’ during the Sept. 23 preliminary election.”

— Recount results end in same council race lineup with Bergman winner over Kamara by Toni Caushi, Telegram & Gazette: “Days of recounting every single ballot cast at the Nov. 4 election ended with one dull snap of City Clerk Nikolin Vangjeli’s stamp around 5 p.m., Sunday, Nov. 23 inside the North High School gym. The results saw the council race lineup remain the same, with Jermoh Kamara – the candidate who asked for the recount after trailing by 23 votes – again finishing seventh, thus missing out on a seat on the council. Incumbent Councilor-at-Large Morris A. Bergman was the sixth-place finisher, staying on the council for another term.”

— Possible last talks of 2025 end in stalemate for Haverhill teachers and committee by Jonah Frangiosa, The Eagle-Tribune: “Little progress was made Wednesday night in what may be the final contract negotiation of 2025 between the Haverhill Education Association (HEA) and the current members of the Haverhill School Committee. Months of stalled talks over salary structure and safety concerns continue with no common ground reached. The teachers have operated on the same, 14-step salary structure from their last contract, which expired on June 30. Discussions for a new contract sprouted in March, but there’s still a significant gap between the two teams’ proposals — disputes centered on pay and safety.”

— Even before the SNAP freeze, Massachusetts families were already going hungry by Will Katcher, MassLive: “Even before the sudden cutoff of SNAP benefits early this month, pantries were already stretched to their limits, more so than the public may understand. The number of families struggling to find enough to eat spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic — and has remained persistently high ever since. From the Berkshires to Cape Cod, Massachusetts’ network of independent food pantries was thrown into chaos at the beginning of November when the Trump administration paused SNAP assistance as the federal government shutdown dragged on.”

It includes the Ara home energy system by dcbel and enables Polestar 3 owners to reduce charging expenses, with Polestar citing potential annual savings of up to $1,300. The system also allows the vehicle to function as a home backup source during outages, with the company stating that customers can use their car as an energy backup during blackouts for up to ten days, depending on usage.

Developed with dcbel, the programme integrates DC-based V2H operation, blackout support and intelligent charging to reduce running costs and improve renewable energy use. The company says the technology makes it possible to use the car as a powerbank capable of supporting the electric grid while parked.

Polestar states that it is progressing additional bi-directional developments, including a bi-directional-ready AC home charger for Germany and upcoming European markets, delivered with Zaptec. The Zaptec Go2 supports future bi-directional charging once enabled on compatible vehicles.

“Bi-directional charging is a gamechanger, not only for the car industry, but the home energy ecosystem. As it lowers your total cost of ownership and makes your car work for you even when parked, this makes the choice of driving a Polestar even more attractive,” said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller.

“It’s a new technology that requires a sophisticated and intelligent ecosystem, and this marks an important first step as we aim to launch bi-directional charging features to more Polestar customers in more markets,” added Olivier Loedel, Head of Software Product Management at Polestar.

Volvo activates bi-directional EX90 functions

At the same time, Volvo Cars has introduced bi-directional charging capability for the 2025 Volvo EX90 in the United States. It, too, dcbel’s Ara Home Energy Station.

The EX90 is the first Volvo model equipped with the required hardware and software to operate bi-directional functions. The vehicle can supply energy to the home, charge in both AC and DC through the Ara system and support household loads when required. Volvo notes that the technology offers the potential to reduce strain on the electricity grid by controlling charging and energy flow during peak demand periods.

“We continue to enhance the benefits of ownership of our flagship EX90 by enabling it to send power back to the home through bi-directional charging,” says Jim Nichols, Head of Product & Technology Consumer Offer for Volvo Cars in the Americas. “By working with dcbel, we’re taking an important next step in our electrification and smart home energy strategy journey to offer smarter home energy options and added peace of mind.”",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/11/polestar-3-v2h-california.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 13:02:47.879312

BELÉM, Brazil, Nov. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- EcoFlow, a global leader in renewable energy solutions, participated in COP30 with a clear conviction: clean, reliable, and smart energy should be accessible to everyone - every household, every community, everywhere.

At an event traditionally dominated by governments, utilities, and global organizations, EcoFlow brings a different voice: climate goals will not be achieved by policy discussions alone, they require solutions that reach real people, real homes, and daily life.

Why EcoFlow Chose to Be at COP30

EcoFlow's presence at COP30 reflects the company's belief that global climate goals cannot be achieved through policy commitments alone—they require practical, scalable solutions that reach households and communities. This year's COP marks the tenth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, and the discussions once again highlight the urgency for real-world adoption of clean energy.

Echoing CEO Bruce Wang's vision, the company stresses that clean energy must be democratized, meaning accessible, reliable, and affordable for everyone, not just institutions or developed markets. Bruce has consistently advocated that innovation only creates meaningful impact when it becomes part of people's daily lives, especially in regions facing climate vulnerability or grid instability.

Energy Independence: From Households to Communities

EcoFlow sees energy independence as the foundation of a resilient clean energy future. What started as portable power for individuals has evolved into a comprehensive home energy ecosystem—covering power generation, storage, distribution, and intelligent energy management. This transformation enables households not only to secure backup energy but also to actively manage consumption, reduce costs, and participate in cleaner lifestyles.

Bruce's core message during COP30 emphasizes that energy independence is not about isolation, but empowerment. When households have the ability to generate and control their own power, they contribute to broader grid resilience and help accelerate global decarbonization. EcoFlow aims to make this autonomy universal, especially in regions where electricity is unstable, expensive, or carbon-intensive.

Driving a Smarter, More Resilient Energy Future

EcoFlow envisions a future where millions of connected homes form a dynamic clean energy network. Through smart systems, demand forecasting, and distributed storage, households can support the grid during peak periods, reduce strain during extreme weather, and even share energy with their communities. This model aligns with global priorities at COP30, where resilience and climate adaptation are key themes.

In line with Bruce's long-term viewpoint, the company believes that the next decade of climate progress will depend on intelligent, interconnected home energy systems. EcoFlow will continue advancing technologies that allow families to monitor, optimize, and share their energy, turning clean power from a personal asset into a collective resource.

Long-Term Commitment to Sustainability

Beyond its strategic presence at COP30, EcoFlow has long been committed to climate action and community resilience through its ""Power for All"" initiatives. In the United States alone, the company donated over $120,000 worth of portable power stations and solar panels to frontline relief organizations and disaster-impacted communities in 2025.

EcoFlow is also expanding access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy in underserved regions worldwide. In South America and Indonesia, the company partnered with local governments and community groups to help residents maintain safe and uninterrupted living and learning conditions during frequent power outages.

Through its collaboration with the Million Forests initiative, EcoFlow has supported desert reforestation efforts—turning every product purchase into a step toward restoring degraded land. In 2024, EcoFlow's solar panels helped reduce over 5,600 tons of CO₂ emissions, the equivalent of planting more than 175,000 trees.

Across Africa, South America, and beyond, EcoFlow remains committed to delivering practical clean energy solutions that strengthen community resilience and bring dependable power to more families around the world, helping power a new world grounded in sustainability and shared progress.

Critics have said banning gas appliances will drive up homebuilding costs, and those increased costs will get passed along to consumers.
Even if a whole new stove isn't feasible right now, you can still take advantage of induction cooking.","A New York developer is getting ahead of an upcoming state ban by making his latest housing project all-electric.

Starting in January, new gas hookups will be banned in New York, WSYR reported, forcing homebuilders to find electric alternatives.

But in Syracuse, Eldan Homes President Dan Barnaba isn't waiting. His current development features no gas appliances.

""This will be the first community that I'm aware of in Central New York that's all-electric,"" Barnaba told WSYR. ""Heating the home, the cooking appliances, the fireplace, and the hot water heater will all be electric appliances.""

Critics have said banning gas appliances will drive up homebuilding costs, and those increased costs will get passed along to consumers. But advocates say that not only will the ban create environmental benefits, but homebuyers will also save money in the long run by using more electric appliances.

""I'm prepared to build homes,"" Barnaba told WSYR. ""The better question is the consumer prepared?""

A good example of this is the kitchen, where gas stoves can be easily replaced with induction cooktops.

Instead of burning gas, which can increase the risk of asthma, induction cooktops generate a magnetic field that transfers heat to pots and pans. This energy-efficient heating method allows you to boil water more quickly and keep more consistent cooking temperatures, without creating any toxic fumes.

Federal incentives can also knock $840 off the purchase price of a new induction stove. Unlike the expiring tax credits on solar panels and electric vehicles, the appliance rebate for induction stoves appears to be sticking around for a while. Still, it may be worth acting quickly to guarantee those savings don't go away.

Even if a whole new stove isn't feasible right now, you can still take advantage of induction cooking. Plug-in burners are a great option that can easily fit on a countertop, all for an affordable price — as low as $50.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gas-stove-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 12:02:33.564165

Driving the news: Curtis, along with Ken Calvert (California) and Thomas Massie (Kentucky), voted this summer against solar tax credits that provided thousands of dollars toward solar installations at their own homes, Politico reported last week.

Zoom in: Curtis once used the tax credits in former President Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to install solar panels and a geothermal pump at his Provo home, according to a 2023 report by the climate publication The Cool Down.

He then supported President Trump's ""Big, Beautiful Bill,"" which phases out the tax credits.

The other side: Curtis supported a gradual phaseout of the solar incentives rather than the abrupt cancellation pursued by many conservative Republicans.

""For years, there was broad agreement, from Democrats to industry leaders, that these subsidies were intended as temporary,"" Curtis told Axios in a prepared statement.

""I fought hard to ensure we had a responsible off-ramp. Today, the solar industry has matured and proven it can compete on its own.""

Flashback: It's not the first time Curtis' solar subsidy has been called out. The Washington Post in 2023 reported that after The Cool Down's tour of his home's eco-friendly features, climate activists slammed his 2022 vote against Biden's bill, which all Republicans opposed.

According to a recent announcement, the Arizona Corporation Commission solidified its position on November 19, voting 5-0 to intervene in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s debate without yet taking a definitive stance.

Fueling the discussion, the Department of Energy issued a directive back on October 23, which has launched Federal Energy Regulatory Commission into a rulemaking frenzy. Designed to ensure an equitable and efficient approach to connecting hefty energy consumers like AI data centers to the grid, the Department of Energy's directive supplied Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with 14 guiding principles. The move, aiming for a 'new era of American prosperity' according to Vice Chair Nick Myers, must now be finalized by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission no later than April 30, 2026. Myers said, ""I agree with the Secretary that to usher in 'a new era of American prosperity,' all Americans and domestic industries must have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity,"" as per the Arizona Corporation Commission's statement.

With deliberations heating up, the Arizona Corporation Commission’s play ensures Arizona will have a voice in the outcome. The state commission is angling to protect its oversight on giant powerloads plugging into the local power grid. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, historically staying clear of load interconnection authority, now wades into new territory. Accustomed to a certain autonomy, states like Arizona, are now posturing to maintain their regulatory influence amid federal shifts. According to the Arizona Corporation Commission, Chairman Kevin Thompson highlighted this tension, emphasizing that ""FERC work closely with the States and state regulators to ensure rules resulting from this proposal affirm state authority and do not inadvertently create challenges to resource adequacy, reliability, and affordability.""",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/11/arizona-corporation-commission-joins-national-debate-on-federal-energy-interconnection-rules-2.webp,N,,2025-11-24 12:03:20.614655

DTEK, which holds Ukraine’s biggest portfolio of energy generation assets and is now developing battery projects in other countries, including Poland, won the Developer of the Year award.

Meanwhile, Energy Dome, the designer, manufacturer, and holder of the IP for its carbon dioxide-based CO2 Battery technology, won the Long-Duration Energy Storage Company of the Year (LDES Company of the Year) award. It also took home the inaugural prize in that category in 2024.

“Energy Dome is recognised for its innovative, non-lithium CO2 Battery technology, with a 20MW/200MWh commercial project operational in Italy and a strong global pipeline, though its focus is primarily on the US market,” judges said.

“The company excels in commercial maturity, execution, and leadership, offering both storage-as-a-service and ownership models, and is backed by major investors.”

EDF took its second consecutive Trading and Optimisation Team of the Year award, and had the company not finished a close second to Habitat Energy in the first ESAs in 2023, would have been celebrating the hat-trick.

The team at EDF Wholesale Market Services, to give its full name, would have consoled, however, by taking home the Breakthrough R&D / Innovation of the Year. EDF’s entry demonstrated the real-world applications of its trading and optimisation (T&O) platform, which judges described as “a leading platform for BESS asset owners, with a strong focus on breaking down barriers for new customers.”

The ceremony took place last Thursday (20 November) at the Park Plaza Hotel on the South Bank of the River Thames, attended by more than 300 industry hopefuls in their finest evening wear.

Hosted annually by our publisher Solar Media, the event brought the industry together to celebrate, with entrants from the UK, Europe and beyond.

After an exclusive live set of comedy from national television and podcasting star Tiff Stevenson, the audience was treated to a procession of well-deserved winners, Highly Commended runners-up, and, of course, shortlisted nominees as they broke bread together and enjoyed an evening of good-natured, sometimes a little raucous, competitive fun.

While Fluence took the top System Integrator ESA 2025 home, rivals were also strongly represented through award wins: most prominently Wärtsilä, which was named on two winning entries via project collaborations with UK developer-investor Zenobē Energy and also NHOA Energy, which took home the EPC Firm of the Year prize.

Zenobē Energy’s Blackhillock grid-forming BESS in Scotland, UK, was a triple winner, recognised as Grid-Scale Standalone Energy Storage Project of the Year, and Best Project over 100MW in both UK and European categories.

Blackhillock is being built in phases, up to a total 300MW/600MWh when complete and this meant it was also eligible in 2023, when Zenobē, a former Developer of the Year winner in 2024, took home the Best UK Project Over 100MW trophy for it.

On NHOA Energy, judges commented that the company has built an “impressive profile” through an extensive pipeline and projects of growing scale in multiple regions worldwide.

WinES takes first-ever Diversity & Inclusion Award

Rutwij Hoshing, investment manager at UK energy storage investor Gore Street Capital won the Rising Star award for industry professionals under 30, with judges acclaiming Hoshing’s “exceptional early-career milestones, including pioneering US IRA tax credit transactions, securing rare California contracts, and scaling a storage portfolio from 9MW to 900MW, with global impact through M&A and £150 million-plus (US$196 million-plus) raised in debt.”

Outstanding Contribution to Energy Storage was awarded to Vidyadhar Rangojoo, principal electrical engineer and a founding team member at Fluence, credited with making a significant contribution to establishing and growing the company’s global industry platform.

Rangojoo also has a “track record of pioneering first-of-their-kind energy storage deployments across continents,” judges said.

“Vidyadhar Rangojoo has made foundational contributions to technical innovation, industry standards, and mentorship, supporting clean energy reliability and training the next generation.”

This year’s inaugural Diversity and Inclusion Award was handed to Women in Energy Storage Network (WinES), the UK-based cross-industry initiative to bring together “significant support from multiple companies to promote gender diversity in the energy storage sector, empowering women in an industry where they are often underrepresented.”

Judges said WinES “has successfully connected a large number of women, with participation from top companies and influential leaders, and serves as a model for creating a more inclusive industry. The initiative is highly praised and has the potential to expand beyond the UK.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tiff-Stevenson-ESAs-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:01:05.878648

The report, part of its new research titled “Li-ion Battery Market 2026-2036,” projects that cell prices could fall to nearly $50/kWh by 2036, based on assessments of material costs and minimal cell prices observed to date.

The lithium-ion battery market is currently dominated by two chemistries: lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP). NMC offers higher energy density but at a higher cost, while LFP is less expensive but provides lower energy density. IDTechEx said it has observed a notable shift from NMC cathodes to LFP in China, Europe, and North America. However, NMC remains prevalent in the latter two regions.

Cathode Costs and Material Volatility

Cathode costs are a significant component of total cell costs, particularly for NMC cells. These are heavily influenced by the prices of nickel, lithium, and cobalt. In 2022, challenges in lithium supply led to an over 80% increase in the cost of NMC cathode active materials (CAM) compared to 2021, according to IDTechEx. LFP experienced even greater price inflation due to its reliance on lithium. However, as of 2025, the costs of NMC 811 cell materials have decreased to below $40/kWh. LFP costs have fallen to under $35/kWh.

IDTechEx noted a trend towards higher nickel content in NMC cells, such as NMC 9.5.5,. These contain 90% nickel compared to the 80% in standard NMC 811. This shift reduces cobalt usage, an expensive metal, IDTechEx said.

Lithium’s Impact on Costs

Lithium constitutes a significant portion of cathode active material costs—84% for LFP and 36% for NMC 811, IDTechEx said. The volatility in lithium prices, driven by supply chain issues, geopolitical tensions, and high capital investment requirements, has historically impacted cell costs. Temporary volatility remains a risk for lithium-ion battery supply in the short, medium, and long term, IDTechEx said.

This issue is further explored in IDTechEx’s report on “Critical Battery Materials.”

Industry Variations in Cell Costs

Cell costs differ across industries. In stationary energy storage, where LFP cells are prevalent, costs are more than eight times lower per kWh compared to consumer electronics, IDTechEx said. These require more expensive cathodes and incur higher non-active material costs due to smaller cell sizes.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stock-lithium-ion-cells-1400.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:22.389536

Analysts with the Georgia Public Service Commission’s staff deliver a stark warning in new written testimony: Georgia Power residential customers could see monthly bills jump $20 or more if the PSC allows the utility to complete the historic power fleet expansion it has proposed to support an influx of data centers.

Instead, PSC staff recommend in filings that for now, the commission should approve only about a third of the new power plants and batteries the company has proposed. To date, the analysts say only a fraction of what the company has asked to build is backed up by signed contracts.

“The rest is speculative and exposes customers to the risk of stranded costs if the anticipated load does not materialize,” Robert Trokey, the PSC’s electric section director, and outside consultants wrote in their combined testimony.

The comments concern the company’s request to add 10,000 megawatts to its power generation fleet in the next five years. For comparison, each of the four nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle near Augusta provides roughly 1,100 megawatts.

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups say the scale of the buildout the company has asked the PSC to approve is unprecedented.

“I think this is the largest single request in terms of how much power they want to build and buy — and how expensive it is — in the history of the state,” said Bob Sherrier, a staff attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.

The staff’s statements come on the heels of a historic defeat of two Republican incumbent PSC commissioners in elections earlier this month, in which customers’ frustration over their rising utility bills was the central issue. The two commissioners who lost, Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols, will get to cast votes in this critical case days before they leave office.

The PSC will decide whether to approve some or all of the company’s proposed buildout on Dec. 19, less than two weeks before the two Democrats elected to replace them take office.

It’s unlikely customers would feel any bill increases from the data center expansion before 2029. This summer, the PSC voted to hold Georgia Power’s base rates steady through 2028. Next year, however, the commission will decide whether the utility can charge customers for its storm repair and fuel costs, both of which could raise bills.

Georgia Power disagreed that the demand is speculative. A company spokesperson pointed to a document filed Friday that the “portfolio” of large customers who have “committed” to receiving electricity service from the utility has grown to 11,000 megawatts.

The utility will file additional testimony next week, a company spokesperson said in an email.

“The electricity demand is based upon the company’s load forecast, which is premised on large load customer commitments and additional organic growth,” the spokesperson said.

‘No guarantee’ customers won’t pay

Georgia is among the fastest growing markets in the nation for new data centers, warehouses packed with servers that power artificial intelligence and our digital lives. Georgia Power and the data center industry say they need more power — comparable to the needs of many large cities — to serve them.

But just as quickly as data center operators say they need these buildings, many are canceling contracts or going to other states. The staff pointed out that this has already happened in Georgia, and the risk is high it will continue.

What’s more, the PSC staff said the evidence shows that so far, Georgia Power’s aggressive forecasts have overestimated electricity demand from data centers.

If this trend continues, Georgia Power could be overbuilding for electrons that have no place to go.

That could leave existing customers stuck paying for those power plants, electricity contracts and grid upgrades whether the electricity is needed or not, the staff said.

For its part, Georgia Power said there are options if those scenarios come into play. These include adding new contracts, delaying construction of planned power supplies or changing upcoming electricity targets.

Earlier this year, Georgia Power and the PSC agreed on new billing terms both parties have said will protect non-data center customers from paying costs incurred to serve the giant server farms. But in their testimony, the PSC staff analysts said those guardrails and assurances aren’t enough.

Most contracts the company has signed so far with data centers were inked before the new “large load” billing rules took effect, staff notes.

“Without executed contracts under the new large load framework, there is no guarantee those costs will not be passed on to existing customers,” Trokey and the two outside consultants wrote.

Meanwhile, Georgia Power stands to profit “tremendously” from the expansion if it’s approved, PSC staff wrote. All told, staff noted the power plant additions the utility wants would nearly double the company’s “rate base,” a key factor in determining its earnings.

Georgia Power likely will ask to charge customers for a wide range of tangential costs for the data centers whether they get built or not, the staff said. This, plus the plethora of costs to upgrade and maintain the power grid, mean Georgia Power will make money off the backs of customers in the long run, they said.

Cost overrun warnings

Staff said the PSC should sign off on 3,100 megawatts, or one-third of the total, and approve another 4,200 megawatts with conditions.

Commissioners should not allow Georgia Power to add the remaining 2,400 megawatts at all, staff said.

Those power projects were the most expensive, staff said.

Georgia Power has been criticized by environmental and consumer advocates for turning mostly to gas-fired power plants to provide the 10,000 megawatts, but PSC staff pushed back on both fossil fuels and carbon-free energy sources — in this case, solar and battery storage.

Staff also took aim at Georgia Power’s ability to finish projects on time and on budget, a chief example of which is its nuclear expansion project at Plant Vogtle. The twin reactors, the first to be built from scratch in the United States in roughly three decades, took seven additional years to finish and were more than double their original forecast $14 billion budget.

While these proposed power plants are different from gigantic nuclear reactors, for customers the economic consequences of delays could be just as great.

“ ... (G)iven the magnitude of the company’s proposed build program and the current highly inflationary environment for generating equipment and labor costs, staff is concerned that there is a significant change that delays and cost overruns could occur at these projects,” Tom Newsome, the PSC’s utility finance director, and outside consultants, wrote in combined testimony.

Many other electric companies in the United States are also looking to build gas-fired power plants, driving up the cost — and creating a backlog — for gas turbines. The proposed battery storage projects are in their early stages, which increases the likelihood of delays and cost increases, and Georgia Power selected contractors that have never built these types of projects before, staff said.

That is according to a new PwC report that delves into how the two sustainable developments should be better coupled in order to scale up together.

The global movement toward cleaner energy and transport is picking up speed, but its success hinges on more than simply swapping out old technology for new. Solar energy has huge potential for the sun-soaked countries of the GCC, which already have robust energy sectors.

There is also a rising wave of electric vehicles (EVs) in the GCC region, much like in other regions. This broad electrification of transportation presents a monumental shift in how people travel, with global electric car sales surpassing seventeen million units in 2024 and projected to exceed twenty million in 2025.

However, this rapid adoption presents a critical challenge: If the power used to charge these vehicles still comes from fossil fuels, the environmental benefit is drastically diminished. The next significant leap in sustainability is not about scaling up individual technologies, but about purposefully weaving electric mobility and solar energy together to create genuinely clean power for transport.

Solar and EVs

Currently, a major inefficiency exists because electric vehicles often charge in the evening when solar output is at its lowest, increasing reliance on conventional energy sources and placing stress on the power grid.

This mismatch overlooks a colossal opportunity: vehicles remain parked for approximately ninety-five percent of the day. With smart planning, this idle time could be perfectly aligned with peak daylight hours for solar charging, maximizing the use of clean energy and reducing pressure on the grid.

Source: PwC

This integrated approach is gaining significant traction, particularly in regions with abundant sunlight and aggressive clean energy goals, such as the GCC nations. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in particular, are positioning themselves to lead the transition.

Saudi Arabia, for instance, has committed to generating a full half of its electricity from renewables by 2030, planning a vast solar capacity of nearly fifty-nine gigawatts. Similarly, the UAE has launched a $6 billion project that will add five gigawatts of solar power combined with nineteen gigawatt-hours of battery storage, creating one of the world’s largest integrated solar-storage systems.

This renewable energy focus is paralleled by rapid electric vehicle adoption, with the UAE seeing an astonishing sales increase of over two hundred sixty percent in 2024, while Saudi Arabia is investing $39 billion to establish a domestic EV manufacturing ecosystem.

Optimized solar charging

The technological framework for this coupling is now maturing – at its core, the solution involves aligning vehicle charging with the sun’s schedule. This is accomplished through smart charging systems, which use digital platforms to automatically time charging sessions to coincide with daytime solar output, especially useful at homes and offices where cars are parked for extended periods.

A more advanced integration involves bi-directional charging, also known as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. It allows electric vehicles to transform into mobile energy assets, capable of not only drawing power but also sending excess energy back to a building or the main grid during periods of high demand.

This model is already being piloted in places like Germany, where a federal grant incentivizes homeowners to install solar panels, battery storage, and bi-directional chargers as a single integrated system.

But despite the clear benefits, the journey to full integration of these solutions faces significant barriers. The power grid and existing charging solutions were not originally designed to handle the dynamic needs of combined solar-EV systems, and the high initial costs for these hybrid systems remain an obstacle for many.

Ultimately, the success of this revolution depends on moving past technical hurdles and focusing on strategic alignment across all sectors. GCC leaders must ensure that policy, infrastructure, and consumer behavior are all oriented toward a future where every electric car is powered by the sun.

“Coupling solar power and e-mobility isn’t just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a new energy economy for the GCC,” said Heiko Seitz, Middle East eMobility leader at PwC. “Clean mobility can become a catalyst for investment, jobs and innovation across the energy value chain, while strengthening grid resilience for decades to come.”",https://www.consultancy-me.com/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-11-24-085746651-Coupling_solar_power_with_electrical_driving_Shifting_gear_in_clean_transport.jpg?webp,N,,2025-11-24 10:00:33.273288

TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to 2025 Talks, where we're following our democracy in historic times.

We believe the reason why TPS was terminated is because of online rhetoric to score political points and scapegoat the Somali immigrant population here in Minnesota.

Jailani Hussain, who leads the Muslim civil rights group Care Minnesota, says a sudden administration decision to strip temporary protected status from Somalis is landing hard in the nation's largest Somali community.

He warns that increasing misinformation is raising real fear in a state with just short of half of U.S. mosque attacks last year.

President Donald Trump's order ends TPS immediately for about 700 migrants nationally.

Trump calls Minnesota a hub of loosely monitored immigrant money transfers.

At a Minnesota press conference, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they're following longstanding immigration law that requires TPS get periodic review.

TPS is a program that was always meant to be temporary.

We plan to follow the process that's in law to evaluate TPS and how it applies to different countries and individuals.

Critics argue Somalia remains unsafe and the move could separate U.S.-born children from their parents.

Minnesota's Democratic governor says Trump is targeting an entire community to distract from his political problems.

The administration is defending a new peace framework for Ukraine.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls current talks in Geneva positive, but lawmakers from both parties say the framework reads like a Moscow wish list.

They question why the president has set a Thanksgiving deadline for it.

On social media, Trump has again accused Kiev of being ungrateful for U.S. support.

In Texas, the fate of a newly redrawn congressional map remains uncertain after a week of conflicting court rulings.

The map targets several Latina-majority districts that helped shape the 2024 outcome, and both parties say the stakes are high heading into next year's midterms.

The White House is ending the IRS Direct File program in 2026, reversing the free tax filing tool launched under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Adam Rubin with the Economic Security Project says it's enormously popular and saves taxpayers billions.

It could save existing tax filers $8 billion in filing fees, and it could help people who are missing out on tax credits claim an additional $12 billion more.

The administration says as part of its economic focus, it wants to replace direct file with a broader, quote, ""affordability-focused system.""

But consumer and government watchdog groups say the government's failure to deal with rising health insurance premiums doesn't make that look promising.

Brian Lemick with Defend the Vote says political dysfunction is making it harder for Congress to address affordability.

Instead of making laws and legislating, they closed the government.

They limit the ability to make sure families have affordable health care.

China dominates 85% of global rare earth refining and 90% of permanent magnet production.

The US and Europe are dangerously dependent on China for materials critical to electric vehicles (EVs), defense, and renewable energy.

Dr. Erik Eschen, CEO of VAC, warns that only industry can fix this strategic vulnerability through firm commitments and a ‘coalition of the willing,’ as politics alone cannot replace industrial action.

New Western production is emerging with VAC’s South Carolina facility shipping magnets.

Major projects from companies like Vulcan Elements, Energy Fuels-POSCO, and Korea’s JS Link are underway.

Experts estimate that replicating China’s capabilities could take 5-10 years.

China controls more than 85% of global rare earth refining capacity and over 90% of permanent magnet production — a grip that has left the United States and Europe dangerously dependent on a single geopolitical rival for the materials powering electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, and missiles according to Dr. Erik Eschen, (opens in a new tab) CEO of German-based Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co KG (VAC). Note the German-based company operates a subsidiary in the United States called VAC-Group. A Houston-based private equity house– Ara Partners (opens in a new tab), now is a primary investor.

Despite decades of warnings, the U.S. has yet to build sufficient domestic capacity to separate and refine rare earth elements (REEs) at scale. Even ores mined at California’s Mountain Pass — the nation’s only active REE mine — are still largely shipped to China for processing. The bottleneck isn’t at the mine; it’s in the chemistry.

The Bottleneck: Bespoke, Dirty, and Difficult

As Rare Earth Exchanges just recently reminded in a piece, rare earth separation is notoriously complex. Though they’re called “rare,” these elements are fairly common — but they tend to occur together, and separating them requires painstaking, element-by-element chemical processing. Each rare earth must be extracted through hundreds of solvent extraction stages using corrosive chemicals and precisely controlled reactions. Any deviation can ruin the purity or yield.

This is what China has mastered over three decades: refining at scale. With aggressive state backing, low-cost labor, and lenient environmental rules, China built a vertically integrated rare earth supply chain while Western nations ceded the industry. Most competitors shut down under price pressure and environmental scrutiny, leaving China’s industrial ecosystem unrivaled in midstream capabilities and technical know-how.

Europe’s Wake-Up Call: ""Industry Must Act""

That reality took center stage at Raw Materials Week in Brussels, where Dr. Erik Eschen, CEO of German-based Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co KG (VAC), issued a blunt warning: “In Europe, we have debated and complained for years. But very little has actually happened. This must change — fast.”

Speaking after a keynote by the European Commission’s EVP Stéphane Séjourné, CEO Eschen underscored the geopolitical urgency. “Rare earths and permanent magnets are now central to global geopolitics — not only in negotiations between the United States and China, but also for Europe.”

He called for a “coalition of the willing” — countries and companies that share values and can build resilient supply chains together.

Eschen’s message: only industry can fix this. Policymakers can ease permitting, reduce bureaucracy, and offer financial incentives, but “politics can support, not replace, industry action.” Without firm offtake commitments from sectors like automotive and wind energy, Europe risks further de-industrialization — and losing what magnet-making capabilities it has left.

Growing Activity Outside China

VAC is one of a handful in a rare earth magnet race. The company announced this month that its new U.S. facility — eVAC Magnetics in South Carolina — has begun production and shipped its first batch of permanent magnets. That makes VAC one of the only Western companies currently delivering rare earth magnets at commercial scale.

Other companies involved with rare earth magnets include Permag (EEC (opens in a new tab)), Arnold Magnetic Technologies (opens in a new tab) plus Canada-based Neo Performance Materials (opens in a new tab) (mostly bonded magnets) and exciting new entrants such as Vulcan Elements, with a several hundred million dollar deal with the U.S. government (plus partnership with ReElement Technologies (opens in a new tab)); Energy Fuels and POSCO are aligning on a rare earth refining and magnet supply chain. Korea’s JS Link (opens in a new tab) announced a $223 million magnet plant in Georgia capable of producing 3,000 tons annually. Of course driving the activity in America is the major equity investment made by the U.S. Department of Defense (War) into MP Materials (opens in a new tab) and the 10x magnet production target. Apple inked a $500 million rare earth recycling magnet product with MP Materials.

Its European factories in Germany, Finland, and Slovakia are also ramping up production. It’s a rare bright spot in a field dominated by China. While firms like MP Materials, Lynas Rare Earths, and USA Rare Earth are investing in mining and separation facilities, most remain years away from full operation. Heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium — critical for high-temperature magnets — remain particularly difficult to refine outside China.

Time, Money, and Political Will

Rebuilding rare earth refining and magnet production in the West will take time. Experts estimate it could take five to ten years to replicate China’s capabilities — if projects can overcome permitting delays, funding gaps, and talent shortages. China’s lead is built not just on capacity, but on experience: decades of chemical fine-tuning, trade control, and end-to-end industrial integration.

In this context, the VAC CEO warning is stark but timely: the decisions that led to this strategic vulnerability were made by industry — and only industry can correct them. But the window is closing. Whether the U.S. and Europe seize the moment may determine who controls the building blocks of 21st-century technology. For now, China still holds the cards.",https://rareearthexchanges.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=8196&type=rare-earth-exchanges&hash=17ba0f41ccc23391c2824cd370af5649,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:13.637328

As the Trump administration methodically throws up roadblocks to slow, if not stop, carbon-free renewable solar and wind power, carbon-free nuclear appears to be the go-to idea for large amounts of power that are presumed to be needed in the future for data centers, AI and more.

Nevermind that before two new nuclear plants opened in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 — seven years late and double their original budget — there had been no new nuclear power plants in the U.S. in more than 30 years.

Now the chatter is around so-called small modular and micro-reactors — touted as easier, cheaper, and faster, leading to a public perception they are ready to be pulled off the shelf and plugged in.

But here’s the problem with that. They don’t exist yet.

Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chair Allison Macfarlane, now director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, is among those who are frustrated with the public and governmental belief about small modular reactors, also known as SMRs.

“They do think that,” she said of the public perception that small nuclear reactors are an immediate option to help meet energy needs. “A lot of the media writes about these things as if they do exist. ‘We know that they’re cheap, we know that they’re safe.’ But we don’t know anything, because they don’t exist.”

But they are in development. As of last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency dashboard listed 127 different small modular reactor designs in existence globally, with about 60% of them in active stages of research and development.

There are three reactors operating around the world that are reported to be small reactors: A floating one in Russia powering a remote Arctic region and two in China, but details about those projects have not been shared.

The SMRs are often bundled under the category of advanced nuclear energy. That advanced designation generally refers to the supposedly newer ways they are cooled, and changes to pressurization and uranium formulation common to the water-cooled light-water reactors that comprise most of the world-wide nuclear reactor fleet today.

“Advanced is rather a misnomer of a term,” Macfarlane said, echoing the views of others. “It should really be non-light-water, because ‘advanced’ suggests there’s something new here, and there isn’t anything new. Most of these technologies have been tried for 50 to 70 years.”

She said eight countries have tried to build more than 25 different versions of one of the technologies — sodium-cooled fast reactors. “No one has been able to get them to produce electricity economically, viably and reliably.”

What do we know and what don’t we know about updated nuclear power options? And how realistic are any of them — including in Connecticut?

The short answer — even the owner of the one nuclear station in Connecticut sees the challenges of building new nuclear in the state. And if those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.

The basics of nuclear power haven’t changed much in decades. It’s carbon-free. The classic units — like the 94 stations operating in the U.S. — can generate a lot of power. The two units at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station total about 2,100 megawatts. Plants can provide that power 24/7 with planned interruptions for re-fueling and maintenance. Despite a plant’s large footprint compared to similarly sized fossil fuel power, it takes up far less space than renewables such as wind and solar fields.

It’s more efficient than other forms of power, including renewables, which means nuclear doesn’t lose as high a percentage of its power as other power sources do. Some nuclear systems require a lot of water for cooling — but so do conventional power plants — leaving both vulnerable to droughts, floods and warming water, some of which are due to climate change.

But nuclear power is not renewable and its radioactive waste is not really recyclable, as some claim. Plants take a long time to build and they cost a lot of money.

Enter the notion of small nuclear power plants broadly, and SMRs specifically.

Smaller nuclear units

“I find the name SMR a little bit misleading because it should be called smaller modular reactor, because they’re still 300 megawatts,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. “This is a substantial facility, requires a lot of civil work, site excavation. So it’s not a factory-produced reactor by any stretch of the imagination.”

Buongiorno said the first one likely to be built in North America is from BWRX — a longstanding nuclear company — at the Darlington nuclear site in Canada. It’s slated for 300 megawatts.

An early-stage project in Wyoming by TerraPower, a private company founded by Bill Gates, will be 345 megawatts. In October the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, approved its environmental impact statement, the first such designation for new technology nuclear.

The federal government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, is also building what it calls an advanced nuclear SMR that uses molten-salt cooling. The unit by Kairos, a startup, is not expected to go online before 2030.

Prior to these efforts, the Biden administration had approved one new project by another startup — NuScale — for a unit in Idaho. But that plan dissolved when costs increased. A larger NuScale design was approved in May by the Trump administration.

Also in May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to speed up several aspects of nuclear development. They include adding 300 gigawatts — that’s 300,000 megawatts — of nuclear power by 2050. And they order the NRC to speed up licensing, which some see as dangerous rubber stamping. Earlier this month, Trump nominated a former executive at Westinghouse, a longtime player in the nuclear space, to the NRC.

But Buongiorno and others said, as an alternative to the SMR, there is a proven modernized reactor already available in the U.S. — the AP1000 — Westinghouse’s full-size reactor.

“It’s a great design. It’s an American design. And my personal opinion is that our best bet if we want to grow nuclear is to build more of those AP1000s,” he said. “The downside of the AP1000 and any other large reactor is it takes time to build these units, and it costs a lot of money.”

That is also the reactor used in the two new units added to Georgia’s existing Vogtle plant. But Buongiorno said it would be a mistake to judge the economics of a new big reactor like the AP1000 by the Vogtle experience. It was the first of its kind so likely to be more expensive and slower, though he admitted overall the U.S. nuclear industry does not have the greatest construction track record.

Westinghouse also hadn’t built a nuclear plant in a generation, which brings up another category of problems. The kind of skilled workforce and expertise needed to build and maintain a nuclear facility has all but vanished in the U.S., as has the supply chain that once supported nuclear construction. While the fuel supply is the same for old and new nuclear plants, there’s not enough of it and some of what is needed comes from Russia.

Then there is the question of whether SMRs and micro-reactors will be cheaper and easier to build. The answer depends on the definition of cheaper and easier, especially considering the cost per unit of power.

Ask Buongiorno if it’s cheaper: “The answer is absolutely no. We expect, actually, small, modular reactors to produce energy that will be more expensive than large reactors. This is a mathematical certainty.”

Ask Macfarlane: “It’s quite realistic — at least the light water reactor designs are realistic. The advanced designs less so.” In fact, Macfarlane has just co-written a paper on the cost question. “We conclude that economies of scale still will hold. It’s just simply cheaper to build a single, large light water reactor than 10 small ones,” she said.

Ask Jeff Semancik, the Radiation Division director at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP): “There’s a trade-off that you’re looking at between what are the upfront capital costs versus the long term cost of electricity.”

On the other hand, Buongiorno points out that investors will perceive the upfront risk as smaller.

“If the check that you need to write at the beginning of the project to build the plant is $3 billion instead of $10 billion, the risk associated with the project is significantly smaller. And that’s really the value proposition for the smaller reactors, the overall project risk, financial as well as execution. There is less to build.”

It’s generally thought the footprint for an SMR won’t be that much smaller, especially if the plan is to install several at once. Siting might be a little easier because of new safety systems that require a smaller perimeter, though factors like access to transmission lines or availability of transmission capacity could impact siting and cost.

The lower the power, the less potential radioactivity if a problem arises. There’s also less radioactive waste, though there’s still no U.S. repository to store it.

As the scale continues to shrink, Buongiorno believes his point about the cost per kilowatt hour continues to hold true. Power from microreactors would be even more expensive per unit, but they are a different animal. They are envisioned to be 10-15 megawatts, but could be as small as one megawatt. The concept is also more as a standalone system that’s not necessarily tied to the grid, so the need for transmission and distribution and its costs may be avoided even though the power itself costs more.

Their use, experts say, would be more for out-of-the-way or hard-to-access locations where connecting to a grid would be extremely expensive or even impossible and where the alternative might be diesel generators. Think remote mining camps or extreme rural Alaska without connecting highways. Or for use by the military, which the Trump executive orders specifically target. The military has a history of small reactor use in things like submarines and aircraft carriers going back decades, though the technologies are not the same as land units.

“The business model is very different. These are not grid-connected electric generators. These are co-located with their end users” Buongiorno said. “So the devil is in the detail of these things, which means it’s all going to be site- and customer-dependent.”

Microreactors are expected to be easily transportable with other needed components, but they are even less developed than SMRs. An initial testing pilot project in the U.S. is expected next summer, which may be aggressive timing, even though some of the well-known and experienced nuclear companies are looking at them. So true deployment, even if everything goes well, is still years away.

What it means for Connecticut

New nuclear is on the table here.

In the last few legislative sessions, lawmakers cleared a slight path. They lifted the state’s nuclear moratorium for the Dominion site in Waterford, which houses Millstone, thereby allowing for nuclear expansion at that location. They also established a process for municipalities to begin consideration of hosting new nuclear facilities and authorized $5 million in bond funds for DEEP to give grants for technical assistance for early site permitting.

To that end, in October DEEP announced informational sessions beginning in December to help municipalities better understand what nuclear power and its new iterations entail.

DEEP is aware of the realities of potential new nuclear power, as evidenced in this 2024 report that noted advanced nuclear technology, SMRs and more are in early stages and that “cost competitiveness has not yet been demonstrated and is unlikely to be realized unless or until such technologies move beyond ‘first of a kind’ projects and are deployed at scale.”

In other words, there’s a long way to go.

“It’s a significant amount of time that’s required to get these large projects off the ground,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, noting that a project like Revolution Wind, under construction now, first solicited proposals in 2017. “Many of the resources that we’re talking about now and planning and engaging on, we’re contemplating deployment and commercial operation timelines that are in the late 2030s. That’s not unique to nuclear.”

But Connecticut does have some unique circumstances with nuclear — some helpful, some less so.

Dykes thinks the national lack of a nuclear workforce is less of an issue here with existing training at Three Rivers Community College in partnership with Dominion, as well as the skill sets associated with the state’s large defense industry — especially submarines and their nuclear components. And she said DEEP already is responsible for nuclear safety.

On the other hand, she and others point out that a deregulated utility market like Connecticut’s could face challenges with nuclear’s expense.

“How do we create the right balance in terms of the investment approach here to making our market an attractive place to invest while not burdening ratepayers with all of the risks of cost increases?” she asked.

In the meantime, in late October, Connecticut signed on as the 12th observer state to an effort known as Advanced Nuclear First Movers, which also has 11 full state members. Its inception was several years ago through the National Association of State Energy Officials, NASEO, as an education mechanism around advanced and other new nuclear.

Now more formalized, the group is working through the variables and unknowns as states consider the various technologies in the face of state climate policies, electricity needs and costs.

Nuclear, while promising, is not a panacea, said David Terry, NASEO’s president. “It’s kind of flashy in the news right now for good reason, because people are interested. But it’s not a panacea,” he said.

And with trying to figure out what kind of power to use 30 years from now and a lead time that could be a decade, the message, he said, is to weigh the pros and cons carefully. “And, oh, by the way, if you choose the wrong thing and you choose too many of the wrong thing, you’re going to pay dearly.”

CT history

Connecticut’s nuclear history dates to the 1968 opening of the Connecticut Yankee in Haddam, which stopped producing electricity in 1996. Millstone Unit 1 began operation in 1971 and it stopped producing electricity in 1995. Units 2 and 3 — which are still running — opened in 1975 and 1986 respectively, with Unit 2 just celebrating its 50th year. Each has had its license extended, to 2035 and 2045 respectively.

The Millstone units constitute about one-third of the power generated in Connecticut and along with the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, the only other nuclear plant operating in New England, supply one-quarter to one-third of the region’s power.

The Millstone units have older technology systems that use Long Island Sound, which is literally outside their doors, for intake and discharge water. In the summer of 2012 after a very warm winter and summer, Unit 2 shut down for 12 days due to intake water temperatures that exceeded what was allowable. The NRC subsequently approved an increase in allowable water temperature and Dominion spokesperson Susan Adams said via email there have been no issues since.

That incident followed a situation in August of 2011 when water from the Sound overtopped the seawall around the plant during Tropical Storm Irene. Adams did not respond directly to the question of whether this has happened since.

The company has clear procedures in place to respond immediately to prevent any impact to operations, she said in an email. “If a storm is coming, we have in our procedures to build a 2-foot-high wall with sandbags around the doors of specific locations.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists has tracked nuclear power safety for years. The director of that effort, Ed Lyman, said climate issues such as rising water temperatures, drought that causes reduced water, flooding and more intense storms are not necessarily safety issues. “But they could be a real operational issues if it has to shut down for some period of time.” He also said plants in Europe, in particular, have had to lower power output during heat waves in recent years.

After the flooding of the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011, the U.S. looked at the flood standards for its plants. “It turns out that nearly every plant in the country, when they did these assessments, they found out that they were probably vulnerable to more severe flooding than they were designed to withstand,” Lyman said.

With the moratorium now removed for additional building on the Millstone site, there has been some chatter that, despite its proximity to the water, it might be a good location for SMRs given that transmission and interconnections are already available.

Semancik at DEEP said the effects of climate change are considered when sites are selected. “You’re required to do a meteorological, hydrological study of all the sites, including what the potential exists going forward,” he said.

While Dominion has expressed interest in SMR development, Adams noted in a lengthy written response that their focus on SMRs at the moment is at a location in Virginia.

“While we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone Power Station, Connecticut might not have the regulatory environment for one. The upfront costs for an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project,” Adams said, echoing Dykes’ concern. “However, we still plan to work with Connecticut’s policymakers on potential paths to taking advantage of SMR’s next-generation nuclear technology.”

Now what?

Buongiorno offers three thoughts on why nuclear can still be considered worthwhile.

One is that in the face of Trump administration policies that don’t advocate decarbonization, if that is a still a state goal, nuclear is the lowest carbon energy source available and it’s scalable. Another is its reliability. It can run 24/7, which means it is stable and therefore keeps the grid stable. And third is its local economic benefits. It provides high-paying permanent jobs in addition to the initial construction jobs. And a facility will pay local taxes.

But he said: “If we need more power between now and the end of 2030, then nuclear can play a fairly limited role.”

And, of course, you have to be willing to pay. “But I got news for you — you got to be willing to pay for any of the energy technology that you choose,” Buongiorno said. “There is no free lunch.”

That’s something Dykes knows all too well.

“How do you do that? What will it cost? How can you de-risk it?” the DEEP commissioner asked. “How can we make sure the costs are shared equally among those who benefit from the investment?”

Former NRC Chair Macfarlane offers a stark answer when asked whether it’s realistic to move ahead with the new reactor designs.

“I don’t think so,” she said. “It depends on what you want to do. And if you either want to A, address climate change or B, address the energy needs from AI, … it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday, and none of these technologies are available.”

She said it may be something to continue to develop and see if will work. But she said it will probably take a couple of decades to commercialize.

“To put all our treasure into nuclear right now is not very smart.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCK_4724-scaled-e1763585120220-1-e1763985303997.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:01:22.415456

While this might seem positive, Ksenia Dray explains that this shift has actually reduced developers’ ability to influence project economics solely through hardware procurement.

Success increasingly depends on optimising every aspect of project economics – from innovative financing structures to strategic technology choices and revenue diversification through storage integration.","The shifting project economics landscape

The mathematics of solar project economics has undergone fundamental changes over recent years. Module costs, which once represented 35-40% of total project capex, have fallen to around 20-30% of overall costs. While this might seem positive, Ksenia Dray explains that this shift has actually reduced developers’ ability to influence project economics solely through hardware procurement.

“The workforce today on a project accounts for much more than the main technology that will influence your yield for 35-40 years,” Dray notes. “It’s more about being able to secure contractors for the mechanical, electrical and civil works at competitive prices, rather than focusing solely on module costs.”

This transformation means that even with modules at historic lows – and expectations of potential increases of one to two cents – developers must look elsewhere to optimise project economics. The challenge is compounded by a shortage of contractors and other key personnel across many European markets, driving up labour costs precisely when developers need to reduce overall capex.

Revenue pressures and market realities

The revenue side of the equation presents equally significant challenges. Wholesale electricity prices have declined substantially across Europe, with markets seeing power purchase agreement (PPA) prices drop to €30-35/MWh (US$35-40), such as in the Nordics, and €50 or lower in Germany, Dray says. This creates a structural imbalance between project revenue potential and construction costs, compressing margins and undermining overall project profitability.

“Projects backed by CfDs or robust PPAs offer far greater bankability,” Dray explains. “Assured revenue streams improve debt capacity, stabilise returns and make the financing process much more efficient. Merchant-exposed projects, on the other hand, carry substantial price-volatility risk — particularly in markets experiencing frequent negative prices such as Germany, Spain, or France — which erodes expected revenues and lowers investor appetite.”

Investor expectations have shifted considerably. Today, capital is concentrating on projects that offer higher returns and a strong de-risked profile — meaning permits secured, grid connection confirmed, and limited exposure to price volatility. Standalone solar projects, especially those fully exposed to market prices and increasing negative-price events, often struggle to meet these elevated return requirements.

Strategic responses and cost optimisation

Faced with these constraints, developers are pursuing multiple strategies to maintain project viability. On the cost side, EPC prices have seen some reduction, falling below €390,000 per megawatt in Germany, or around £400,000 (US$523,000) per MW in the UK. However, Dray cautions that these figures generally reflect ‘vanilla’ projects with no site-specific complexities and minimal contingencies. In reality, most projects cannot reach these ultra-low cost levels, and this likely represents the limit of what can be achieved through traditional cost reductions alone.

“There’s a limit to where capex can drop,” she observes. “Projects are complex, and in the UK, for instance, archaeology constraints or drainage requirements can significantly increase costs. In other regions, rocky terrain or challenging ground conditions have a similar impact. These site-specific factors ultimately set a realistic floor on capex, and they must be carefully assessed, because they can materially influence the project’s overall profitability and the attractiveness of the initial investment.”

Alongside managing costs, developers are also looking more broadly at ways to optimise overall project performance. This includes strategic module selection, with some developers exploring back-contact modules to increase yield and capture additional revenue points. The emphasis on yield optimisation becomes critical when revenue per unit of generation is under pressure.

The rise of hybrid solutions

Perhaps the most significant strategic shift has been toward hybrid projects combining solar with battery storage, which are gaining prominence as developers seek ways to enhance project value. However, Dray cautions that hybrid projects aren’t a guaranteed route to higher profitability. “You can uplift a project’s economics by two to three percentage points with a hybrid configuration, but demonstrating that value is complex. The market is still maturing in terms of hybrid design, and credible hybrid revenue models — including hybrid PPAs — are only just emerging. Lenders and investors want to see a clear, proven revenue stack before they are comfortable financing these projects,” she says

The key challenge lies in the regulatory landscape. In many European markets, the rules for valuing storage and defining which grid services it can sell are still unclear. Relying solely on merchant participation in capacity or balancing markets introduces significant risk, and investors generally prefer more stable, predictable revenue streams.

“This uncertainty is why many banks and investors remain cautious,” Dray explains. “Without a clear and established framework for storage revenues, it’s difficult to underwrite long-term returns.”

Market outlook and industry adaptation

The cumulative effect of these challenges is becoming apparent in market dynamics. Solar Power Europe’s growth projections have been revised downward in H1 2025. The market is now expected to slightly contract to -1.4% in 2025 under the ‘medium scenario’, making it the first year of decline in nearly a decade, rather than the initially optimistic 7%. The high scenario now forecasts only a 1.1% growth.

M&A activity in the European renewables sector has slowed sharply, a trend closely tied to tightening project economics and a broader cooling of investor appetite for ‘green’ assets, which are now viewed as carrying higher risk and weaker returns.

Ksenia Dray suggests the industry may need to accept a shift in business models. “It’s not just about electricity prices— it’s the growing revenue volatility,” she says. “Storage can strengthen the revenue stack and improve risk-adjusted returns, whereas standalone solar is finding it increasingly difficult to remain competitive on its own.”

The challenging economics have also driven innovation in how transactions happen. Digital platforms are emerging to streamline M&A processes, reduce transaction costs and connect buyers with sellers more efficiently. One such example is the platform Nrdeal, which not only facilitates investments in renewable energy projects by connecting key actors, but also provides the market intelligence and advisor network needed to evaluate assets in a more complex economic environment. By reducing the administrative burden of transactions and providing better visibility into opportunities, platforms such as Nrdeal accelerate deal cycles in a market where investors are becoming increasingly selective.

Looking forward

The European solar industry stands at a crossroads. While the fundamental drivers for renewable energy deployment remain strong, the economic realities require a more sophisticated approach to project development and financing. Success increasingly depends on optimising every aspect of project economics – from innovative financing structures to strategic technology choices and revenue diversification through storage integration.

The challenge for developers is navigating this complexity while maintaining the scale of deployment needed to meet Europe’s 2030 renewable energy targets. As Ksenia Dray suggests, this will require continued innovation in project design, financing mechanisms and market structures to bridge the gap between current economics and deployment ambitions.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Ksenia-Dray-RES-Group-crop.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:05.890377

Your Innovation Strategy Is Only as Strong as Your Talent Strategy This is the moment leaders need to reframe how they think about hiring.","Executives across the UK keep talking about AI transformation, clean energy acceleration, and the opportunities unlocked by the £55 billion R&D boost.

But very few are confronting the real threat that will decide whether any of these strategies succeed:

⚠️ A systemic skills shortage that is growing faster than investment, technology adoption, and policy development.

If capital, technology, data infrastructure, and government support are all increasing…

why are organisations still struggling to deliver?

Because innovation isn’t constrained by budget.

It’s constrained by people.

And right now, the UK is entering the most intense talent shortfall since the birth of the digital economy.

This isn’t a talent “challenge.” It’s a structural risk. And most organisations are still treating it as a hiring inconvenience.

A Perfect Storm: The Workforce Pressures Colliding at Once

Several forces are hitting UK employers at the same time — and all of them compound each other.

1️⃣ AI adoption is creating demand across every industry simultaneously

The Government’s AI Opportunities Action Plan estimates up to £400bn in economic potential but warns of a massive AI capability deficit.

Every sector is hiring for:

data specialists

model governance talent

AI ethicists

automation leads

AI-enabled R&D roles

This isn’t cyclical competition — it’s systemic.

2️⃣ Clean energy expansion is accelerating workforce demand

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan outlines a surge in:

grid modernisation

hydrogen production

wind, solar, nuclear, and fusion R&D

battery storage

sustainability leadership

environmental AI

These require hybrid digital–engineering–policy skillsets the market simply doesn’t have enough of.

3️⃣ R&D funding is driving spikes in specialist roles

£55bn of research investment across health, biotech, climate science, engineering, and frontier tech means academic and commercial R&D teams are pulling from overlapping talent pools. This is creating a hiring environment where:

research labs

clean tech startups

universities

defence suppliers

AI scale-ups

…are all chasing the same profiles.

4️⃣ Leadership capability isn’t keeping up with technological complexity

Emerging roles such as:

Chief AI Officer

Director of Net Zero Strategy

Head of Digital R&D

Director of Advanced Manufacturing

… require leaders who understand systems, regulation, data, policy, innovation, and compliance. These people are exceptionally rare — and the UK is behind global competitors.

5️⃣ Legacy HR models are collapsing under modern workforce demands

Most orgs still rely on:

static job descriptions

siloed hiring

rigid permanent-only recruitment

slow approval chains

outdated assessment frameworks

None of this works in high-innovation, high-ambiguity environments. Innovation is dynamic — your hiring strategy must be too.

The Outcome? A National Workforce Crunch That Will Slow Innovation

We’re already seeing consequences across the market:

🔸 AI projects paused because governance roles can’t be filled

🔸 Clean energy programmes delayed due to engineering shortages

🔸 R&D cycles slowing due to a lack of cross-disciplinary scientists

🔸 Public sector transformation programmes stalled due to skill gaps

🔸 Competition driving salaries up 20–40% in some capability areas

🔸 Organisations hiring reactively instead of strategically

And here’s the blunt reality:

If you don’t solve your workforce strategy now, your innovation strategy will fail later.

This is the new board-level risk very few leaders are prepared for.

The Biggest Mistake Exec Teams Are Making Right Now

Most organisations respond to skills shortages with a simple tactic:

👉 “Increase the salary and post the role again.”

This is not a strategy. It is a reaction.

And it guarantees you will lose the talent race.

The real solution is not competing harder for scarce people…it is designing a smarter workforce model.

That means looking beyond job titles and instead building capability frameworks aligned to emerging markets.

How Identifi Helps Clients Solve the Innovation Bottleneck

At Identifi, we specialise in high-complexity, high-regulation, innovation-driven markets.

We work where AI, R&D, sustainability, and technology intersect — and where hiring mistakes are costly.

Our approach is built for exactly the environment the UK is now entering.

1️⃣ We turn unclear hiring needs into defined capability structures

Most new roles emerging in AI, clean energy, and R&D don’t fit standard job descriptions.

We help clients by:

defining capability areas

mapping role evolution

identifying cross-domain transferable skills

determining what can be trained vs. what must be hired

This reduces recruitment friction and speeds up decision-making.

2️⃣ We give clients access to non-obvious talent pools

Because we work across:

defence

cyber

public sector

fintech / financial services

biotech

climate /green tech

…we can cross-pollinate talent into emerging clean energy and AI markets. This is a significant competitive advantage.

3️⃣ We build hybrid workforce models

Permanent hires alone cannot deliver national-scale transformation.

We help clients blend:

interim leaders

contract specialists

permanent hires

fractional subject-matter experts

project teams for R&D acceleration

This provides agility — essential in innovation-heavy markets.

4️⃣ We challenge assumptions — respectfully and strategically

If the market can’t supply the talent you want, we’ll tell you.

If your EVP won’t attract future-critical talent, we’ll tell you.

If your job spec is wrong, we’ll tell you.

Identifi’s value isn’t just hiring — it’s market truth.

The Risk of Doing Nothing

If organisations don’t actively address workforce constraints, they face:

Delayed AI deployment

Missed R&D funding opportunities

Slower clean energy progress

Higher operational risk

Reduced competitiveness

Greater cost of future hiring

Inability to meet regulatory requirements

And in sectors tied to national strategy — delays hurt more than your bottom line.

Your Innovation Strategy Is Only as Strong as Your Talent Strategy

This is the moment leaders need to reframe how they think about hiring.

The next decade will reward organisations who:

move early

design their talent architecture

build hybrid workforce capability

partner with recruitment specialists who understand policy + innovation + regulation

Identifi Global is uniquely positioned at this intersection.

The fully vertically integrated $1.1bn facility spans roughly 2.4 million square feet and uses advanced AI technologies in its manufacturing processes to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production.

The company said that production at the Louisiana facility began in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.

First Solar attributed the accelerated timeline to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and trade policies enacted during the Trump administration, which increased demand for American-made solar technology compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern guidance.

The facility manufactures First Solar’s Series 7 modules using domestically sourced materials, including glass from Illinois and Ohio and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into back rails in Louisiana.

Louisiana governor Jeff Landry said: “First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses.

“This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

The Iberia Parish facility employs more than 700 people and is expected to employ 826 employees by the end of the year.

Once fully operational, the facility will add 3.5GW of annual nameplate capacity, expanding First Solar’s total American manufacturing footprint to 14GW in 2026 and 17.7GW in 2027.

The Louisiana facility is part of the reportedly largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere.

This foorprint includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing plants in Ohio, one in Alabama, and R&D centres in Ohio and California.

First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said: “This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity.

“By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialisation isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

Recently, First Solar announced plans to invest in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet.

By the end of 2026, the company expects to employ over 5,500 people in the US and to have invested approximately $4.5bn in domestic manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

This move is part of a broader effort to streamline federal permitting of energy infrastructure.

At its meeting on November 20, the Commission voted to issue two Notices of Inquiry (NOIs). One (Docket RM26-3-000) seeks comment on changes to the hydropower licensing process under the Federal Power Act (FPA) – specifically on whether maintenance, repairs, upgrades and other post-licencing activities at hydroelectric projects can proceed without project-specific FERC orders.

The other NOI (Docket RM26-2-000) covers similar procedural questions for LNG facilities.

FERC Chair Laura Swett said: “Energy infrastructure needs to be built now, and existing projects need to be maintained efficiently to ensure grid reliability today and in the future. We are taking a hard look at our processes and ways we can simplify certain activities.”

Hydropower facilities operating under FERC licences must obtain authorisation for many kinds of changes, even post-licence. The National Hydropower Association (NHA) in the US has long maintained that the process of licensing, relicensing and amendments is burdensome. For example, the NHA has noted that nearly half of the non-federal US hydropower fleet is due for licence renewal by 2035, and that delays and high costs are causing licensees in some cases to consider decommissioning rather than relicensing.

There was no new climate fund designed specifically for emerging economies, no binding fossil fuel phaseout decision, and no separate adaptation package that directly addressed India’s vulnerabilities.

Still, the final text did reinforce global principles that India has long defended, particularly equity, climate justice and the idea of a just transition.

While these may not count as headline-grabbing victories, they strengthen India’s negotiating foundation for upcoming climate rounds and help clarify what global commitments will look like over the next decade.

NEW NDCs SOON

The most concrete milestone for India at COP30 was something it announced, rather than something it received.

New Delhi finally announced its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), laying out clearer targets for cutting emissions, renewable energy growth and adaptation efforts through 2035.

These updated NDCs matter because they give India a firmer roadmap for climate action at home while also making it easier to attract international partnerships and investments. Prior to the announcement, India's 2035 NDCs had attracted major attention due to a delayed announcement, which finally came noting the targets are to be announced in December of this year.

In many ways, the NDC announcement was India’s strongest substantive contribution to the summit.

TECHNICAL, INDUSTRIAL TRANSITION SUPPORT

India also gained quieter, but still important, momentum in industrial transition partnerships.

During the LeadIT roundtable, several countries renewed support for India’s shift toward low-carbon manufacturing, green hydrogen development and technology-sharing.

These aren’t formal agreements with new numbers attached, but they strengthen the practical collaborations India relies on to meet its long-term decarbonisation goals.

In a summit where major breakthroughs remained elusive, these incremental gains were amongst the most realistic outcomes.

CLIMATE FINANCE GROWTH

Climate finance remains India’s biggest sticking point.

At COP30, India pushed for predictable, accessible funding for both mitigation and adaptation. While the final text did call for scaling up finance and reforming global financial institutions, no binding commitments or new mechanisms emerged.

India leaves Belem with clearer expectations but without concrete new financial resources in hand.

THEN, WHAT DID INDIA GAIN?

India’s gains were modest but meaningful.

The most populous country did not secure large, immediate wins. Yet, it strengthened its position on equity and just transitions, reaffirmed global support for its industrial transformation, and most importantly, locked in updated NDCs that offer a concrete, actionable roadmap for the coming decade.

This was not a summit of dramatic breakthroughs for India, but it was one of consolidation, clarity and subtly reinforcing the foundations for the bigger climate battles ahead.

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

A South Philly native and former climate advisor for the Biden administration is running to replace Dwight Evans as the representative for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District. The crowded field now includes 10 Democratic candidates who will face off in the primary on May 19.

Pablo Iván McConnie-Saad said he’s focused on the connection between affordability and climate change.

“I think people don’t necessarily make that connection,” McConnie-Saad told WHYY News. “But, I think climate change is raising the cost of food, and obviously we’re experiencing increasing energy costs, and that’s also a result of climate change.”

McConnie-Saad pointed to the impact of high heat and floods on food production, which a recent study found is driving up prices.

The Bella Vista resident also said he’s about to be a father.

“It’s not just for myself, it’s also for the next generation,” McConnie-Saad said. “We have to focus on climate. It’s an existential crisis.”

McConnie-Saad worked for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, helping to increase the use of available funds through the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s signature climate initiative that encouraged clean energy production and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through tax credits, rebates and incentives.

Since taking control of the White House, President Donald Trump has worked to dismantle the initiative and claw back much of the funding. Still, McConnie-Saad said Pennsylvania gained $700 million in investments from the Inflation Reduction Act.

“It was working at the individual level,” McConnie-Saad said. “At the household level, at the organizational level, so small businesses could benefit from it, and so could local governments and state governments. It was providing an opportunity for municipalities, nonprofit, tax-exempt, faith-based organizations to invest and make the transition to renewables, and that was gonna bring down the cost for everyone.”

While affordability is front and center for voters, climate change is not, said Democratic political consultant Neil Oxman.

“If Greenland melted tomorrow, climate would be the No. 1 issue,” Oxman said. “But Greenland’s not melting tomorrow. And so the number one issue is the economic strain that people have.”

McConnie-Saad has also taken aim at the current politicians in the race — state Sen. Sharif Street, state Rep. Chris Raab and state Rep. Morgan Cephas. The rest of the field includes two doctors, Ala Stanford and David Oxman, real estate developer Isaiah Martin, Temple University computer science professor Karl Morris, software engineer Cole Carter, and former city employee Robin Toldins.

But McConnie-Saad has the same problem that nine other candidates in the race have. Street, son of former Philadelphia mayor John Street, has a clear advantage through family name recognition, fundraising abilities and a strong base in a part of the city where voters have cast ballots for a candidate named Street for decades.

The 3rd Congressional District encompasses all of West and Southwest Philly, along with Center City, North and Northwest Philadelphia west of Broad Street. It also represents a section of South Philadelphia that includes McConnie-Saad’s Bella Vista neighborhood.

“It’s been a long time that people in there have voted for somebody named Street,” Oxman said.

While Oxman said it will be hard for anyone other than Sharif Street to gain traction in such a crowded field, it is possible, especially if several end up dropping out and putting their energy behind one of their current rivals.

McConnie-Saad, who grew up one of four boys in a Puerto Rican family, said he lived in six different South Philly houses by the time he was 17. McConnie-Saad got a Quaker education as a scholarship student at Germantown Friends School. He then earned a bachelor’s degree at Oberlin College, followed by a master’s and doctorate from the University of Delaware. He said he can distinguish himself through his Beltway experience.

“I’ve been in Washington. I have a Ph.D in urban affairs and public policy,” he said.

He also believes in standing strong against Trump and aligns himself with the Democratic Socialists of America, the ranks of which include the likes of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani.

“I’m very disappointed in the Senate Democrats that have caved on the shutdown,” McConnie-Saad said. “It’s tantamount to a union organization going on strike and then not gaining any concessions from management. This is an instance where I think we talk about standing up to the Trump administration. I’m arguing that we should be calling for general strikes.”

When asked, McConnie-Saad wasn’t sure what a general strike would look like.

Given the overwhelming majority of registered Democrats in the 3rd Congressional District, whoever wins the primary on May 19 is expected to win the general election in November.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Pablo-McConnie-Saad.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 07:00:57.598628

This landmark agreement marks a pivotal step in the establishment of MU CITY — a City of Dynamic Innovation in Energy, Mobility, and Urbanization, designed to accelerate Southeast Asia’s transition toward a low-carbon, digital, and inclusive future.

Signed in collaboration with the Karimun Regency Government, the agreement affirms a shared commitment to building a next-generation integrated industrial and innovation ecosystem. MU CITY is now firmly positioned as a regional gateway for clean energy, green manufacturing, advanced e-mobility, and data-driven intelligence — supporting Indonesia’s national roadmap for renewable energy and digital transformation. The MU CITY development represents an estimated USD 2.3 billion investment over the next three years, making it the largest single investment in Karimun to date.

A Dynamic City for the New Energy Era

Spanning 4,000 hectares, MU CITY will be powered by up to 2 gigawatts (GW) of solar power and an additional 2 GW of gas-based power, making it one of Southeast Asia’s largest integrated sustainable energy ecosystems. A major portion of this capacity will power the local industrial zones, data campuses, and mobility manufacturing clusters within MU CITY, while the remainder will be allocated for clean energy exports to ASEAN nations — reinforcing Indonesia’s role as a regional energy provider.

MU CITY will integrate three complementary development zones:

Clean Energy Hub – Anchored by large-scale solar power plants, advanced battery energy storage systems (BESS), LNG import facilities, CCGTs and blue ammonia tank complexes to support domestic decarbonization and regional export markets. This hub will serve as MU CITY‘s energy backbone.

Mobility & Manufacturing Hub – Dedicated to clean transportation innovation through electric vehicle assembly, battery manufacturing, AI chip ecosystems, and green industrial production aligned with Indonesia’s vision for electric mobility and advanced manufacturing.

AI & Digital Infrastructure Hub – Powering up to 1.21 GW of hyperscale data center capacity, purpose-built for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and high-performance digital workloads — all powered by renewable energy generated within MU CITY.

Together, these interconnected hubs will position MU CITY as a leading force in clean innovation and digital transformation, redefining how energy, technology, and mobility harmonize with people and the planet.

Empowering Local Communities Through Partnership

Through close collaboration with the Karimun Regency Government, Aslan is implementing a cooperative and inclusive development model in which over 10,000 local residents actively participate and benefit from the project’s growth.

This is good news for Western North Carolina (though we’re still waiting on the remaining $52 million).
Consequences for Western North Carolina Communities in Western North Carolina have felt these failures acutely.","Summary:

Local communities have led Helene recovery, but federal support has fallen far short of what’s needed.

Federal reimbursement is only 9%, far lower than in past disasters.

FEMA dysfunction and political efforts to weaken the agency have delayed aid.

The damage Hurricane Helene inflicted on Western North Carolina last year borders on incalculable. The efforts of Western North Carolinians to rebuild during the past year stand among the greatest displays of resilience and courage in recent memory. Local residents led the recovery, supported by mutual aid networks and faith communities that provided critical assistance in the weeks and months after the storm. Despite this extraordinary work, the long-term recovery has become a source of frustration due to the lack of substantial federal support.

In September, Governor Stein requested both increased federal funding and the release of federal dollars already promised to Western North Carolina. His office outlined these concerns in a formal federal funding request, noting: “State and local governments and private corporations and charities are contributing billions collectively to this work, but their efforts alone cannot restore our communities.” The inadequate federal response reflects the consequences of disruptive federal reorganization and efforts by the Trump administration to limit support for Americans affected by disasters.

The Federal Response

The federal government traditionally plays a major role in helping communities rebuild after natural disasters. These recovery efforts often require more resources and expertise than local governments can provide. Disasters also affect multiple states, which creates a need for federal coordination. Hurricane Helene caused damage across ten states, underscoring this point.

FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was created in 1979 to support communities before, during, and after disasters. Its mission is wide-ranging and demands sustained federal commitment. FEMA works alongside other agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, and the EPA. The USDA has also outlined its role through its post-Helene recovery initiatives.

Historically, the federal government has provided significant financial support for major disasters. As Governor Stein noted, federal support covered 78% of the economic damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, 73% for Hurricanes Maria and Katrina, 60% for Gustav, and 53% for Matthew. Yet for Helene, the federal government has thus far covered only 9%.

Why Has the Government Been So Unhelpful?

Two major factors explain the lack of federal support.

The first is mismanagement. Instability within the Trump administration has directly affected FEMA. The agency is already on its third director this year, following the resignations of David Richardson and Karen Evans, both of whom were appointed without emergency management experience. Reporting in The New York Times examined Richardson’s troubled tenure and departure in detail through a review of FEMA leadership turmoil. His predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, was dismissed only a day after testifying to Congress that FEMA remained essential to communities in crisis, as documented in a separate news report.

This mismanagement aligns with a larger deliberate effort to weaken, eventually eliminate, FEMA. Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem have both advocated for dismantling the agency. A broader analysis of this agenda, including its fiscal and humanitarian implications, appears in a Carnegie Endowment assessment of the administration’s push to abolish FEMA. The lack of federal support for Helene recovery is therefore not only a result of bureaucratic dysfunction but also part of a larger political project to withdraw the federal government from disaster response.

As FEMA resources to help rebuild the devastation in Western North Carolina have ground to a halt, the consequences have been noticed by political leaders in both parties. Just weeks ago, none other than Republican U.S. Senator Ted Budd blocked three Senate nominees submitted by President Donald Trump’s White House to demand action from FEMA. Specifically, Senator Budd asked the Department of Homeland Security (under which FEMA operates) to approve $64 million in reimbursements to North Carolina county governments, which are long overdue to be paid. Remarkably, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem released $12 million of those reimbursements the very same day following Senator Budd’s action.

This is good news for Western North Carolina (though we’re still waiting on the remaining $52 million). But what it also reveals is that a faster response is, in fact, entirely possible – those in charge in Washington simply aren’t doing it.

Consequences for Western North Carolina

Communities in Western North Carolina have felt these failures acutely. Disaster recovery leaders have repeatedly warned that federal delays are slowing progress. Avery County Commissioner Dennis Aldridge described FEMA as “our biggest obstacle,” a point highlighted in WRAL’s reporting. Avery County has already spent approximately $50 million on recovery and cleanup, despite having an annual operating budget of just $42 million. FEMA has agreed in principle to reimburse many of these expenses, but payments have been slow. Several news outlets have documented these delays, including WRAL’s coverage of counties pushed to their limits by slow FEMA reimbursements and The Washington Post’s analysis of stalled federal payments.

The recovery process is far from complete, and slow federal action only makes it harder for communities to rebuild. A federal government that restricts FEMA’s ability to operate effectively creates further harm. In response, Attorney General Jeff Jackson has filed suit against the federal government for withholding disaster relief funds, as reported by ABC11. A system that forces states to sue for congressionally approved disaster funds is deeply flawed.

Western North Carolina deserves a federal partner that will show up when disaster strikes. So do communities across the country. Anything less is its own form of disaster.",https://carolinaforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Helene-Swananoa-.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 12:04:17.714946

“This is not just an economic discussion or an environmental discussion.","As countries debated a transitional path to clean energy usage, hundreds of faith-based organizations worldwide committed to divest from climate-warming fossil fuels during the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Belém, Brazil.

""We also want to assume our responsibility before God and humanity for what happens with our money and what happens to God's creation,"" said Pastor Neddy Astudillo of Tampa.

She attended the gathering, known as the 30th Conference of the Parties or COP30, as a delegate from Presbyterian Church USA. The 12-day event ended Friday.

""It was very good to be there as a Latina living in Florida, living in a state where the government has erased the word ‘climate change’ from its web page,"" Astudillo said.

Astudillo was invited to speak at a parallel event called the People's Summit, which amplifies voices from undeserved communities most impacted by global warming.

In her talk, she described how environmental racism, human rights and democracy are connected, illustrating her point through current events in Florida.

""The difficulty that we have in Florida of passing laws to protect migrant farmworkers from the increasing heat waves,"" Astudillo said.

“Another example is the building of the 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention center … built in an already climate-vulnerable ecosystem without a prior environmental impact study on the already threatened species, and without the involvement and approval of the Miccosukee people who live and are impacted by the presence of the detention center. Not to mention the impact that this place has on immigrant communities in Florida who are fearing deportation.”

Astudillo said the meeting's location in the Amazon allowed about 900 Indigenous delegates to attend.

""It is a statement of the kind of people who also need to be present in the negotiations, whose lives are being threatened, and whose culture and worldviews and spiritualities also have a say,"" Astudillo said.

She added that Indigenous peoples are the caretakers of 84% of the world's biodiversity and rainforests, which are key to reversing the effects of climate change.

Astudillo is concerned about the location of the next COP in Turkey.

“The last two COPs before Brazil happened in countries that did not have the same freedom for public participation: conversation and marches and the social movements, expressions during the COP,” Astudillo said.

“I'm not sure how it's going to be happening in Turkey, but at least as a Latina, a COP in Latin America provided a space for many more voices to be included in the conversation.”

This was her fifth COP, having attended the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was established to guide future climate negotiations.

Astudillo’s husband, Thomas Spaulding, was also there in 1992. He was asked by the national leadership of the YMCA of the USA to take a role in that process.

He was a member of the observer in the U.S. delegation at a time when President George H.W. Bush famously said ""the American way of life is not up for negotiation.""

“The American way of life should be something about … we all win when the Earth can thrive,” said Spaulding.

“This is not just an economic discussion or an environmental discussion. This is a cultural discussion … and that's one of the reasons why I think the faith community's roles are so important, because it's about morals. It's about ethics. Who are we as a people? What are we passing to our children and our grandchildren and their children?”

Astudillo mentioned moving words from a former delegate of the Philippines with a similar sentiment.

“He said that the climate battles that we face today will not be won in the chambers of the U.N. climate talks,"" Astudillo said, ""but in people's hearts, and that's where faith communities can make a difference.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b997349/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fa7%2F99ccd2db4a88b04b6f0ec7c59095%2Fneddy-astudillo-speakinhg-at-the-people-summit-cop30.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:02:07.464267

Real, artificial.","'Tis the season for Tannenbaum. It’s just a matter of which one.

The choices can seem overwhelming at first: Will a blue spruce fill the house with the sharp scent of balsam better than a white pine? Will a 15-foot fir fit in the living room, and what colored lights should you drape on its needles this year?

Beyond the aesthetics, you might wonder if it’s more eco-friendly to cut down a real tree or purchase an artificial one. We dug into the debate to find out which option is more sustainable.

The case for artificial trees

Over the next month and a half, Christmas tree farmer Tom Dull expects to see more than 25,000 people walk through the grounds of Dull’s Tree Farm. Various species of evergreen trees, ranging from three to 16 feet tall, sit in neat rows across 65-acres nestled in the rolling hills of Thorntown, Indiana. Many folks who visit the farm this season will leave with one of the trees in tow.

Dull is convinced that real trees like his are more environmentally-friendly than artificial ones.

“It’s an easy argument to win,” he said, adding real Christmas trees are “recyclable, they’re renewable, they’re good for wildlife.”

However, Dull acknowledged, some people have an aversion to chopping down real trees year after year. Looming threats of climate change and headlines with news of deforestation might mar the twinkling memories of stooping in the snow, surrounded by family, to saw through the trunk of a living tree.

But Christmas tree farms aren’t exactly forests under siege; they’re actual farms. And the 65,000 trees on Dull’s farm that store carbon, breathe out oxygen and create habitat for wildlife might not have existed if Dull’s first dream — to be a hog farmer — worked out.

Still, many environmentalists argue that agriculture and development are leading drivers of habitat loss in Indiana and the Midwest. More than 14 of Indiana's 23 million acres were cultivated as cropland in 2022, according to the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, and 448 native plant species are endangered or threatened in the state.

Although he did not deliberately set out to do so, Dull created a wildlife habitat on his tree farm, something a hog farm would likely never have accomplished. Dull and his employees have seen deer, coyotes, foxes, rabbits, quail, mice, snakes — and once, even a bobcat — snaking through the fields of pine, fir and spruce.

Dull, whose species of choice is a concolor fir, said that he plants more trees than his customers chop down. He expects to sell around 6,500 trees this year and plant 10,000 more in 2026.

The case for artificial trees

Jami Warner, the executive director of the American Christmas Tree Association (ACTA), a trade group representing the artificial Christmas tree industry, thinks that the carbon footprint of either type of tree is ""really quite small,"" especially when you consider how long consumers keep artificial trees.

""An artificial tree is an investment. It is something you use year after year. It's the epitome of sustainability,"" she said. ""Our members have customers who have kept their trees for years and years and years, and they pass them down from generation to generation. They become sort of heirlooms.""

Much of a real tree's environmental impact comes from its disposal, so an artificial tree's long lifespan works in its favor in the battle for the greenest tree award.

An assessment commissioned by the ACTA in 2017 showed that buying an artificial tree has a ""more favorable effect on the environment"" than real trees if kept for at least five years, Warner said.

But transportation emissions — artificial trees are often imported from China — and the plastic manufacturing required to replicate small green pine needles still concern consumers. Warner said some companies, like Balsam Hill, are leaning into new technology, such as plant-based plastics, but most artificial trees are still made from steel and resin.

Buying a new artificial Christmas tree each year probably isn't as eco-friendly as buying a live one annually, but Warner said she thinks most Americans keep their artificial trees for around a decade.

And for some folks, an artificial tree is the only option.

Families living in small apartments, people with limited mobility or someone worried about fire safety might prefer an artificial tree. In fact, more than 80% of the country does, according to the ACTA.

Evergreen disposal matters

Perhaps the most environmentally impactful part of a tree’s life cycle, real or artificial, is where it is laid to rest.

On Dull’s tree farm, some trees that don’t get sold are tossed into the property’s pond where they create habitat and offer protection for the fish, Dull said.

In his eyes, the plastic of artificial Christmas trees makes the real thing far superior.

“You buy a fake tree; it's made out of petroleum,"" he said. ""You throw it away; it stays a landfill for who knows how long.""

Despite a rising demand for artificial trees, the real Christmas tree industry still woos a fair amount of Hoosiers: there are more than 200 Christmas tree farms in Indiana, creating habitat for wildlife in agricultural parts of the state and supporting local economies. Dull's Tree Farm employs more than 170 locals during the pumpkin and Christmas tree seasons, including many young people.

In the true holiday spirit, Warner thinks choosing the right tree all comes down to personal preference and circumstance.

""There is no such thing as a bad Christmas tree,"" she said. ""They're all beautiful. Real, artificial. Charlie Brown, tall, short, one-sided, multicolored, whatever. There is a perfect Christmas tree out there for everyone.""

Orange County resident Jamie McConnell read about PFAS in biosolids and what other states have done to curb the risk.","A flush of a toilet, the rinse of a washing machine, or the discharge from factories – it all ends up as wastewater. That waste is then treated and made into a sludge called biosolids. Biosolids can be converted to agricultural fertilizer and by using it, many farmers in Virginia may be unknowingly spreading toxic chemicals on their land that could end up in crops and the state’s waterways.

As state Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, said in a recent State Water Commission hearing, “we don’t want it to go in the river anymore, for goodness’ sake.”

Biosolids can contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which pose serious health risks if people are exposed to them in higher amounts. The danger has led some states to outright ban, or enact stricter requirements in the use of biosolids, and prompted calls from some Virginia communities to do the same.

PFAS are everywhere; Virginia doesn’t test for them in biosolids

Forever chemicals are in hundreds of products we use every day, from nonstick cookware to takeout food packaging and even dental floss. They take hundreds of years to break down and can be a serious challenge to remove from the environment. The use of these chemicals started around the 1940s and has only expanded with time.

Being exposed over long durations and frequent occurrences to PFAS increases the risk of the chemicals interfering with the body’s natural hormones, possibly increasing cholesterol levels, lowering women’ s chances of getting pregnant, affecting the immune system, or boosting the risk of certain cancers.

The hangup for many community members and lawmakers is that Virginia does not test biosolids to see if there are high concentrations of PFAS in them.

The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality does sample rivers and creeks across the commonwealth to look for the presence of PFAS, however, that data dashboard was disabled on the agency’s website during the course of writing this story.

DEQ is not required to test biosolids for the presence of PFAS under current law. A map provided by the agency shows that biosolid permits have been granted in almost all corners of the commonwealth, but the map has not been updated in five years.

The federal Environmental Protection Agency put out a draft assessment on the risk two chemicals in the PFAS family pose on farmers with amounts as small as one part per billion. However, the report did not call for the regulation of those chemicals when they are found in biosolids.

Maine became the first state to ban the use of biosolids after multiple farms were shut down after extreme levels of PFAS were detected in soil, livestock, and even farmers’ blood where biosolids had been spread nearby. Well water at these farms had also been poisoned by the chemicals. The state has set up a fund to aid farmers who may have had to halt their production due to the presence of PFAS.

Michigan prohibits the use of highly contaminated biosolids from being used, but still lets some be spread on the very small amount of land that still uses biosolids. Meanwhile, Virginia only regulates setbacks from wells and homes during the spreading of the sludge as well as nutrient management plans for the fields.

Researchers, communities press for PFAS protection

At Virginia Tech, Shilai Hao researches analysis of PFAS in the environment and is looking for ways to permanently remove it. He said that people are commonly exposed to forever chemicals by way of the products they use. Hao said it is critical for the state government to be testing biosolids due to the concentration of those chemicals in one source.

“Testing helps agricultural producers understand whether biosolids-derived products are safe to apply on their farms. It also helps wastewater treatment plants decide how biosolids should be managed or disposed of to reduce PFAS-related risks,” Hao said.

One of the companies that provides biosolids in Virginia is Synagro. It is in the process of getting permits reissued in multiple counties. A spokesperson for the company said “Synagro is a passive receiver of PFAS from municipalities, who themselves are passive receivers from their customers.”

The spokesperson went on to say that Synagro supports potential legislation to remove PFAS at the source or to implement discharge limitations for manufacturers to stop it from ending up in wastewater.

The Shenandoah Valley has a concentration of biosolid permits issued near Charlottesville, according to the 2020 map. At the University of Virginia, Bryan Berger is researching how PFAS end up in soil and food. He said that despite PFAS being basically ubiquitous, biosolids still pose a higher risk.

“There’s a direct correlation between PFAS application and PFAS levels in drinking water and blood serum. At minimum, you’d want to test because you don’t want to have that,” Berger said. “Why do that to yourself, expose yourself to that risk?”

The concern over biosolids is not new in Virginia. Stuart Overbey lives in Albemarle County, where she is trying to raise awareness for years about the farms in her area that have permits to spread biosolids. She said in the summer of 2024, when spreading was happening near her house, the substance was all over the roads.

“You had to roll up your windows, turn off your AC. It’s not like cow manure smell or even chicken manure. It’s like death. It’s like your body reacts,” Overbey said.

She has been collecting stories of people across Virginia who say their health and well water quality declined after neighbors used biosolids. She’s joined forces with groups like the Piedmont Environmental Council and community advocates in Orange and Albemarle counties to request public hearings for the permit requests and renewals for the biosolid companies.

In Virginia, counties can pass ordinances requiring the testing and monitoring of biosolids. Overbey has written a draft for her county but it has not been taken up by the Board of Supervisors yet.

The permits in each county last for 10 years and additional land can be added between each permit. In Orange County, Synagro is currently going through the process to add 200 acres to their permit and remove 1178 acres for a total of 2564 acres permitted for the sludge.

Orange County resident Jamie McConnell read about PFAS in biosolids and what other states have done to curb the risk. When he first learned about it he didn’t know how to try and stop it from being used in his community. Now he’s pressing the state to take action.

“They didn’t know the extent to which it’s contaminated. It’s an outrage at the DEQ that they won’t test. It’s silly,” McConnell said.

At an October meeting, dozens of community members showed up to a hearing about the reissuance of the Orange permit. Some of the land in the permit is near Pamunkey Creek.

The chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, R. Mark Johnson, wrote to DEQ to alert the agency that PFAS has already been detected in the creek. Johnson wrote that the board is not against the use of biosolids for fertilizer, but they want to ensure farmers are aware of potential contaminants.

“Our farmers deserve to know what they’re putting on their land, and our citizens deserve protection from forever chemicals,” Johnson said in his letter.

Alternatives to biosolids

With biosolids being a cheaper option for farmers who need to use fertilizers on their land, many are asking what can be done to reduce the need for it.

On a windy November afternoon outside of Charlottesville, Massey Teel coils up a wire on his land to let cows, sheep, goats and donkeys shift over to a new small quadrant of land, part of the process of regenerative farming.

Every day he moves his livestock to a new roped off area of his land to feed and drop their own waste. He doesn’t put them back in the same area for months to allow for the natural fertilizers to work into the land and the grasses to grow back.

The land he works on had been leased to a previous farmer who had used biosolids in the past. Teel said he understands something has to be done with the waste – but there needs to be more done to help the environment and preserve farmland.

Teel said often, crops are grown and cattle are raised in ways that don’t allow the land to naturally regenerate nutrients, leading farmers to need the fertilizer.

“It’s not just that those biosolids are being put down there or any other fertilizers being put down there, but because they have poor ground cover and every time it rains, a huge amount of that fertilizer is going to flow downstream,” Teel said. “ And it has all sorts of negative effects for our watersheds all the way down to the bay.”

There are ways to reduce that need, protect the land from runoff and save farmers money, Teel said, including more oversight from state authorities.

“As far as I’m concerned, a little more regulation is not a bad thing,” Teel added.

In Richmond, lawmakers are debating how to protect their constituents who increasingly reach out to them with their worries about the chemicals in biosolids.

Stuart, the state senator representing King George, said Maryland recently set limitations to how many parts per billion of PFAS found in the sludge can be allowed in order to spread the substance on agricultural land. That often leads to Maryland’s biosolids being shipped over to Virginia, which does not have such limits.

He said he plans to bring legislation in the 2026 General Assembly to set limits and require testing. He would prefer to have a zero tolerance, he said in an interview, but understands that may not be fair to industry.

“I think it’s important that you go, we at least meet or go below Maryland’s threshold, because if we don’t, they’re going to keep sending it across the river with us,” Stuart said. “The EPA guidelines are much higher than Maryland’s threshold. So we’re not going to be able to rely on the EPA.”

With the strong pushback from communities in Orange county as well as Essex County, Synagro has put a pause on the Essex permit process to see how things play out in Orange, a DEQ representative told the Water Control Board last week.

Legislators will decide the next steps for PFAS testing of biosolids in the upcoming General Assembly session in January. If they fail to take action, there could be negative consequences for Virginia’s agricultural industry and communities, some experts warn.

“If we just let this come to pass, and we apply these biosolids and we don’t test we can look at places like Maine as an outcome, right? Where there’s now dairy cattle and milk, which is heavily contaminated to the point that, you know, farmers have to dump the milk and can’t sell it anymore and you can’t just clean it up. That farmland is lost,” UVA’s Berger said.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1115-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 10:03:33.675407

The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2025 confirms that electricity is quickly becoming the backbone of the global energy system. Electricity demand is soaring. Renewables are continuing to rise globally. But Governments are too slow in delivering the infrastructure needed to electrify industry, mobility and heating. And they need to address new supply chain risks.

This month the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its World Energy Outlook 2025 in which it claims that the world has entered the “age of electricity”.

The IEA estimates that electricity demand will rise by 40–50% by 2035, driven by electrified industry, transport, digitalisation and heating. Investment in electricity supply and electrification already accounts for half of today’s global energy investment. Global investment in data centres is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025.

To meet this electricity demand, renewables – wind and solar in particular – will continue to rise globally, the IEA’s Outlook states. Renewables are the fastest-growing energy source in all scenarios presented in the World Energy Outlook.

More investments in grids and storage required

The message from this year’s World Energy Outlook is clear. Europe must accelerate wind energy deployment and build electricity grids that can match this buildout.

Investments in electricity generation have charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015. But annual grid spending has risen at less than half that pace. Electricity connections and storage are lagging. This creates grid congestion, higher electricity prices and curtailed renewables output.

Without faster permitting and investment in infrastructure, Europe will fall behind in the “age of electricity”. It will lose its position as technology leader in clean tech. And it will put its economic competitiveness at risk, as China is pushing ahead, electrifying their economies. The “age of electricity” in short: the future is electric – and renewables are leading the charge.

Energy security depends on the grid. That’s the message from COP30, the IEA’s World Energy Outlook – and from anyone who wants cheaper, cleaner energy. The European Commission is set to present its EU Grids Package on 10 December to fix bottlenecks in Europe’s electricity system. What should it do?

Align grid planning with energy policy. Make sure investments happen.

Push anticipatory investments. The grid must be ready for new renewables.

Filter out speculative connection requests. Prioritise strategic projects.

Boost EU funding and EIB financing. It’s cheaper than paying for congestion.

Incentivise optimisation of existing grids. Dynamic line rating can unlock capacity.

Prioritise connections for combined wind, solar and storage projects.

Drive a regional approach with more cross-border interconnections.

Speed up permitting. Treat grids as overriding public interest – but keep ambitious wind deadlines.

Improve procurement. Long-term contracts and clear goals cut costs.

Support grid equipment manufacturing. Europe needs more transformer factories. Follow the wind supply chain model.

This will help unlock GW of wind energy currently waiting for their grid connection permits. Now Member States will have to move fast to implement it.",https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/grids-meet-renewable-conference.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 08:00:42.269673

Having grown up on that farm, he knew about flora, fauna and other nature. So when his public-policy career started draining him and he'd ""gotten sick of writing deadly serious policy papers,"" he tasked his brain (and heart) to come up with poetry and prose instead.

Cardwell's latest book, his sixth, is ""Limestone & Leaves."" Humans need to plunder less and plant more, he believes. This collection of poetry and prose describes Cardwell's lifelong concern for the environment.

""We have to do everything possible to engage in dialog about what we're doing to the environment,"" he said in a recent phone call. ""If we don't, it's going to be hard for future generations to live in a civilized way.""

Public policy papers turn to poems and prose

Cardwell, who lives in Indianapolis, spent his career in writing and examining public policies. Some of his particular interests concerned people with disabilities, Native Americans, retired people and home- and community-based care.

""I worked with a group that made substantial changes to long-term care,"" he said. He worked as the legislative and program director for Citizens Action Coalition, where he ""was their point-guy for all the public policy initiatives.""

Formed in 1974, Citizens Action Coalition is Indiana's oldest and largest group devoted to advocating for consumers and the environment. It helps Indiana residents with energy regulations, utility reform, healthcare, pollution and farms run by families. Staff do research, education outreach and lobbying of lawmakers, as well as assisting and litigating for people in utility cases before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Citizens Action Coalition's mission statement also mentions preserving democracy, conservation of natural resources and access to human services.

A tale of two squirrels

Maybe one of Cardwell's motivators to attempt poems and prose was the squirrel that would ripple up the tree outside Cardwell's office window — and spy as the writer typed. ""He just sat in that tree and stared at me,"" Cardwell said. Another squirrel appeared, and this one had no use of its two hind legs.

""It would climb up and down the trees — living in the wild — with its back legs not working! That squirrel lived like that for two years.""

From Cardwell's poem ""A Small Animal, Really?"" come these words at the piece's close:

""In a thousand years, I speculate squirrels

will have managed to maintain their niche,

if climate change does not take us all.

As for humans, who can say if that will

be true, but if it is not,

I am certain the squirrels will be digging

in the trash we leave for a long time.

A small animal, really, but don't vote

against them.""

In 2014, Cardwell the public advocate, was breakfasting with his wife, Nancy Griffin. He wasn't yet a poet but was reading a piece by someone who was. ""Hey, I could write a better poem than this,"" Cardwell said. ""(Nancy) sneered, so I walked off and wrote one. When I reappeared and read it to her, she said, 'Hey, that's good.'""

Writing about nature, he said, lets him write about humans.

""Nature gives us a means to address issues. We don't hold up our end of the bargain with nature. We take so much from the environment around us.""

Forests, which support huge quantities of flora and fauna, are in danger of human-led destruction. Every year 15 billion trees are felled throughout the world, which is roughly 38,610 square miles of forest each year, according to the British Ecological Society.

Industrialized fishing harms marine life, and internationally, humans are catching more fish than can reproduce, according to the Oceanic Preservation Society. More than 90% of marine stocks are abused or ruined outright. Up to 40% of marine life is captured inadvertently (not the target), the society reports.

Hundreds of thousands of seals, dolphins and whales, die every year in traps meant for fish. This is in addition to birds, sea turtles, sharks, and others dying due to unethical fishing methods.

In Cardell's poem ""Warmth and Radiation"" he says:

""developers are forcing turtles

to cross busy highways,

house cats are killing salamanders,

Florida's panthers are looking anorexic,

bees are being chemically nuked.""

Living beings other than humans, he said, don't affect the environment in the ways we do, such as destroying vegetation to erect buildings. ""In Bloomington, for example, any beautiful woods is at risk because of rapid development.""

Readers will feel Cardwell's appreciation of nature and history, as they learn about Hoosier forests, rural living and prehistoric creation myths.

It's something Cardwell and his wife, Nancy, understand: They own and operate a small farm.

For the Impact and Sustainability track, the conversation has shifted from mere sustainability to regeneration by creating systems that improve both the environment and community well-being. This expanded role leverages business events to drive global equity by empowering under-represented voices and creating policy for vulnerable communities, all while demanding data-driven credibility through transparent reporting on metrics like carbon footprint, food waste, and measurable impact outcomes.

Meanwhile, discussions during the Future Leadership and Resilience Sharing Hub indicate that in an era of rising member activism and geopolitical ‘noise’, the most critical leadership skill is principled neutrality, and anchoring the organisation in its core mission to serve as a calm, de-escalating force.

Simultaneously, association leaders must shift their value proposition from being mere knowledge providers to competence builders, focusing on actively developing the skills members need to succeed. The events industry’s long-term viability also depends on renewing the social contract with host cities, ensuring that events deliver shared prosperity, while improving the local quality of life.

During the Purposeful Business Models and Start-ups Sharing Hubs, it was found that the most entrepreneurial associations are now transforming events by making purposeful business models a reality. This is done through embedding impact requirements directly into RFPs, which establishes legacy as a contractual deliverable for host cities.

Events are also intentionally convening experts to produce lasting policy frameworks, where this approach proves that purpose is the ultimate competitive advantage, driving profitability and brand differentiation. To achieve this, there is a call to co-create and move beyond transactional bids to genuine engagement and partnership.

As for the Innovation and Technology track, the key consensus among stakeholders is that AI should be treated as a co-pilot, not an autopilot, using it to augment human capability and boost team efficiency rather than replace staff.

Leveraging AI for hyper-personalisation – delivering tailored session recommendations and matchmaking – is also now a core strategy for maximising attendee ROI. The ultimate goal for data usage is to move beyond simple engagement metrics and utilise information to prove impact.

Finally, during The Creative Edge Sharing Hub, it was found that the most authentic events tap into the DNA of a city by integrating its history, culture, and spirit into the delegate experience. Moving beyond the visual, events must be designed for all five senses, utilising soundscapes, scents, and textures to create immersive and memorable multi-sensory narratives.

This requires viewing local talent not as hired entertainment, but as co-creators, turning the event into a canvas for authentic cultural expression. Finally, a key design challenge is to intentionally design for serendipity, creating beautiful and effective spaces where valuable, unplanned connections can naturally occur.",https://ttgmice.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/Sharing-hubs_640.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:02:20.398856

Foreword

The United Kingdom stands at a pivotal moment in its industrial evolution. As global competition intensifies and technological transformation accelerates, we must ensure that British industry is not only resilient but also relentlessly competitive.

The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) is a flagship intervention of the Industrial Strategy – a strategy built on a clear vision: to back the sectors and businesses with the greatest potential to drive sustainable growth, productivity and prosperity across the country.

This scheme directly addresses one of the most pressing challenges facing these businesses today: how to remain globally competitive while navigating some of the highest industrial electricity costs in Europe.

By providing eligible manufacturing businesses with exemptions from the indirect cost of the Renewables Obligation, Feed-In Tariffs and Capacity Market schemes, BICS will reduce cost pressures and support the long-term viability of our most strategically important industries.

This consultation seeks views on how to determine which businesses within the Industrial Strategy manufacturing frontier industries, and manufacturing foundational industries in their supply chains, should be eligible for the scheme.

We want to ensure that the approach we put in place is workable for businesses and support is directed to where it will have the biggest impact on economic growth. Your feedback will help us shape a fair, transparent and effective scheme that reinforces the strength of our manufacturing base.

This scheme is part of our broader commitment to backing British industry with practical, responsive policy. By reducing electricity burdens, we can unlock investment, protect jobs and ensure our Industrial Strategy sectors remain world-leading in both productivity and industrial excellence.

I encourage all stakeholders to engage with this consultation and help us deliver a scheme that reflects the needs and ambitions of British industry. I look forward to hearing from respondents on this important topic.

The Rt Hon Peter Kyle MP

Secretary of State for Business and Trade and President of the Board of Trade

Introduction

Context

The government is committed to retaining a modern, dynamic and globally competitive industrial base as part of its wider Industrial Strategy. However, high electricity costs have made it increasingly difficult for businesses to compete with their international counterparts.

This government has been clear that the long-term answers to the challenges around energy security, affordability and sustainability point in the same direction – clean energy. Last December, we launched our Clean Power 2030 Action Plan which set out a detailed plan for achieving the target of clean power by 2030. Our clean power target means transitioning to an electricity system that produces at least 95% of Great Britain’s generation from clean sources.

To address the more immediate electricity cost challenges, the government announced the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) as part of its Modern Industrial Strategy. The scheme aims to support eligible manufacturing frontier industries within ‘IS-8’ manufacturing sectors, and manufacturing foundational industries which provide important inputs to the frontier industries, who meet a certain threshold of electricity intensity. It will do this by bringing British electricity costs more in line with other economies in Europe, and level the playing field for British businesses.

Businesses eligible for BICS are to be exempt from paying the indirect cost of 3 schemes:

the Renewables Obligation and Feed-in Tariffs which require electricity suppliers to make payments to support generation of electricity from renewable sources

the Capacity Market which requires electricity suppliers to make payments to ensure the UK has adequate electricity capacity

The proposed scheme will apply in Great Britain only, given that energy policy is largely devolved in Northern Ireland. The scheme will require implementing legislation and be designed in compliance with the Subsidy Control Act, the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and other international subsidy control commitments.

As the scheme is developed, it is vital to ensure that its design is robust, fair and delivers the intended benefits to British industry. This consultation seeks views on the proposed approach, including how eligible businesses should be selected.

This scheme is one of a suite of interventions announced in the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy which made the following commitments:

an increase in support for our most energy-intensive industries (EIIs) eligible for the Supercharger package, with an uplift of the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) scheme from 60% to 90%. The NCC uplift will reduce electricity prices for about 500 eligible highly electricity-intensive users by around a further £8 to £10 per megawatt-hour (MWh), bringing the total reduction to around £65 to £87 per MWh.

continued support for the Energy-Intensive Industries Compensation Scheme which tackles carbon leakage. We will conduct a review of the scheme by the end of this year that will set out how we plan to continue supporting EIIs through the scheme when the UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is implemented in 2027.

supporting the development of the Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPA) market in the UK, as a potential route for energy consumers to secure more stable electricity prices for the long term. The government will call for evidence in due course on how the market for CPPAs can be developed and improved for industry.

a new ‘Connections Accelerator Service’ which will provide support connecting to the grid for demand projects, including prioritising those that create high-quality jobs and bring the greatest economic value. We will work closely with representatives from the energy sector, local authorities, Welsh and Scottish governments, trade unions, and industry to design this service, which we expect to begin operating at the end of 2025.

new powers, in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill (PIB), which will allow amendments to regulatory processes and accelerate connections for strategically important projects; and launching a new Strategic Sites Accelerator (SSA) and setting up AI Growth Zones (AIGZs) across the UK. The SSAs will enable the government to deploy a range of interventions to bring sites to market faster, such as land remediation, anticipatory grid capacity, transport improvements and fast-tracked planning approval.

establishing AIGZs as dedicated hubs to fast-track artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure development, support planning approvals, and unlock access to energy.

The rationale for the scheme

Evidence from advanced economies suggests that there is a strong link between high energy prices and reduced economic activity. Over the last 20 years, higher electricity and energy costs have been associated with lower investment , lower productivity (including lower capacity utilisation) , lower rates of employment , and more firms leaving the market .

These effects have been pronounced for advanced manufacturing industries and more energy-intensive foundational sectors in their supply chains, which play a crucial role in driving economic growth.

Great Britain has been particularly heavily affected by rising electricity costs. Between 2008 and 2020, electricity prices in the UK rose by approximately 50% , resulting in an estimated fall in manufacturing investment of between 13% and 26% .

The same analysis also suggests that increasing electricity costs could account for a reduction of 9% of jobs in pharmaceuticals, and 8% in chemicals, with similar reductions in other manufacturing sectors. Firms frequently cite high electricity costs as one of the largest risks to their business .

While many countries have faced similar increases in electricity costs in recent years, the UK has seen a sharper rise than other comparable nations. In 2024, the UK’s industrial electricity prices (including taxes) were the highest of all countries in the International Energy Agency data published by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), and more than double the EU-14 + UK median for large and very large industrial users .

We recognise the need for a broader approach to help level the playing field on electricity costs between Great Britain and our competitors, so we can capture major growth and investment opportunities and secure our supply chains. Our most electricity-intensive sectors at risk of carbon leakage already receive support through the British Industry Supercharger, among other schemes.

The international price gap

Retail electricity prices are made up of 3 components:

wholesale price – the costs suppliers incur to purchase electricity from generators

network costs – the costs of maintaining and operating transmission and distribution infrastructure

policy costs – the costs used to fund environmental and social policies, including investment in homegrown low-carbon generation, such as the Renewables Obligation. These costs are levied on electricity suppliers, who typically pass them on to consumers via their electricity bills. This investment is vital to lowering wholesale electricity prices and reducing exposure to international gas price volatility

Great British electricity prices are high due to a combination of structural and policy factors. British wholesale electricity costs are relatively high for a number of reasons including a reliance on natural gas for electricity power generation, periods of higher carbon prices on electricity generation due to the Carbon Price Support and lower levels of interconnection than within mainland Europe.

They are broadly comparable to similar nations (apart from the USA whose domestic gas price is decoupled from world markets because they are self-sufficient in gas), and are expected to fall as the amount of renewable generation increases.

However, British policy costs on industrial electricity are significantly higher than most other major economies. For very large industrial users in the UK they typically are around £61 per MWh or around 27% of the overall electricity bill compared to around £2 per MWh for France and £10 per MWh for Germany .

Great Britain has historically funded the development of renewables infrastructure via electricity bills rather than taxpayer funding. Britain distributes these costs more evenly between households and industrial users, compared to other countries where household bills bear a larger proportion of the cost .

The government is committed to addressing high wholesale and network costs through long-term investment in infrastructure and generation capacity. Our plans to deliver clean, homegrown power and accelerate to net zero will reduce the exposure of industry to volatile fossil fuel prices.

However, high electricity prices are an urgent concern for our manufacturing sectors, where there is fierce competition for investment to gain advantage in future growth markets. This means there is a strong case to take action now, and providing exemptions from some policy costs provides an efficient mechanism to reduce costs in the immediate future.

Overview of the scheme

This scheme has 2 main objectives:

grow the economy: retain and attract investment in manufacturing businesses in frontier industries within IS-8 manufacturing sectors with high growth potential, by bringing their electricity costs more in line with other economies in Europe

protect the basis of our economy: support manufacturing foundational industries that supply important inputs to the IS-8 by addressing high electricity costs, with a view to boosting supply chain resilience

Together, these objectives are designed to ensure that manufacturing businesses with the greatest potential to deliver growth can thrive in a challenging international environment, supporting both immediate economic growth and long-term industrial resilience.

How the exemptions will be implemented

To achieve the objectives, BICS proposes to exempt eligible business activity from the indirect costs of the RO, FIT, and CM schemes.

These costs fund policies to support the development of renewable energy (in the case of the RO and FIT) and protect the security of electricity supply (in the case of the CM). They are levied on electricity suppliers, who typically pass them on to customers via their energy bills. We expect this exemption to reduce costs for eligible businesses by between £35 per MWh and £40 per MWh.

To implement these exemptions, we intend to amend existing secondary legislation establishing the RO, FIT and CM. For the RO, which is devolved in Scotland, the Scottish government will be responsible for making the necessary legislative changes. We will further engage stakeholders in advance of making these legislative changes.

The proposed scheme is due to commence in April 2027, subject to implementing legislation and the completion of subsidy control processes. The scheme will run until 2035, with a review in 2030 to ensure that, as prices evolve, it continues to deliver its aim of supporting the competitiveness of British businesses in critical manufacturing Industrial Strategy sectors through support on their electricity prices, and that it is operating in an efficient and cost-effective way. This review will also consider whether the methodology for identifying businesses in eligible sectors will need to be updated.

Impacts of the scheme

Anticipated impacts of the scheme are outlined and a full impact assessment of the scheme will be published alongside legislation.

Impact on eligible businesses

Eligible businesses will incur a familiarisation and administrative burden in the application process. Through the scheme design and lessons learnt from previous support schemes, the aim will be to minimise these costs.

Impact on other electricity users

By bearing down on costs across the energy system, we expect to deliver BICS and ensure that the scheme is delivered in line with our wider priorities to deliver affordable power for businesses and households. For example, the proposals in DESNZ’s recent consultations on RO and FIT indexation, if implemented, could contribute to that goal.

Impact on suppliers and delivery bodies

There are 64 domestic and non-domestic electricity suppliers in the Great British market with a further 38 suppliers which serve non-domestic consumers only. All licensed suppliers are expected to be in scope for applying BICS exemptions to RO, FIT and CM costs for eligible businesses, and may face familiarisation costs and administrative burdens associated with the change of policy.

Suppliers’ obligations with respect to these policies will be unchanged overall. We will work closely with suppliers to explore the requirements and costs related to system changes and aim to design the scheme in a way that minimises administrative burdens. We will support suppliers to implement the scheme in a robust and cost-effective manner. This will include specific engagement that will run in conjunction with this consultation.

We are conscious that the scheme should not create unnecessary financial risk for suppliers and are interested in views on how best to ensure the scheme does not place additional burdens on supplier cashflow or result in uncertainty of cost recovery. For example, we will pay particular regard to the period of notification to suppliers before commencement of the scheme to assist them with tariff pricing.

We will continue to work closely with existing scheme administration bodies, including Elexon and the Low Carbon Contracts Company, to plan a cost-effective and streamlined delivery pathway for the scheme.

Interaction with other schemes

The British Industry Supercharger (BIS)

Since 1 April 2024, eligible Energy Intensive Industries (EIIs) have benefited from the British Industry Supercharger (BIS): a decisive set of measures to make Britain’s strategic EIIs more competitive and tackle the challenge of carbon leakage. The BIS scheme and BICS are both designed to support British businesses with high electricity costs.

Both schemes exempt eligible businesses from the indirect costs associated with the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs, and Capacity Market. However, the BIS scheme also exempts eligible businesses with costs associated with Contracts for Difference and provides compensation for the charges paid for using the Great British electricity grid through the EII Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme.

Some businesses, such as high electricity-intensive firms in the steel and chemicals sectors, may meet the criteria for both the BIS scheme and BICS. These businesses will only be able to apply for 1 of the 2 schemes, as the same exemptions cannot be provided twice.

Businesses already in receipt of, or eligible for, the Supercharger will be ineligible for BICS for the same reason. Businesses which meet the criteria for both schemes are recommended to apply for the BIS, to take advantage of the higher level of support.

While eligibility for both schemes is dependent on an electricity-intensity test, the threshold for this test will differ across both schemes. For BICS, this electricity intensity threshold will be determined following consultation. It will be lower than the BIS scheme (which is set at 7% at the sector level and 20% at the business level), considering the different objectives of the 2 schemes.

Eligibility for the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS)

BICS is aimed at manufacturing businesses in manufacturing frontier industries within IS-8 sectors, and manufacturing foundational industries in their supply chains, which meet a certain threshold of electricity intensity.

This means that, to be eligible, a business must:

operate in one of the manufacturing frontier industries within an IS-8 sector, or in a manufacturing foundational industry which provides important inputs to the frontier industries

carry out manufacturing activities

meet the required level of electricity intensity

Figure 1: illustration of the steps to determine eligibility

The following section sets out the rationale for including each of these tests and outlines how they will be administered.

Criterion 1: eligible businesses must operate in a manufacturing frontier industry within an IS-8 sector, or in a manufacturing foundational industry providing important inputs to the frontier industries

Why we are targeting these businesses

Support is being targeted to specific sectors which we have identified as having the greatest potential to achieve our policy objectives: namely, growing the economy by retaining and attracting investment in high-potential industries, and enabling production of the inputs required by those industries.

The IS-8 are the sectors identified by the Industrial Strategy as having the highest potential to drive growth across the whole economy. Within those sectors, the frontier industries are the subsectors at the cutting edge, where there are major opportunities to be captured if the UK can attract the necessary investment and build competitiveness.

Supporting the foundational industries is necessary to ensure frontier industries have ready access to important components. These sectors provide important inputs for the IS-8 sectors, meaning they play a significant role in underpinning broader growth opportunities. Foundational industries are heavily impacted by high electricity prices and are natural targets for BICS support.

How this test will be administered

We need a system which will enable business to clearly identify whether they are in scope and that can be reflected in legislation. Businesses applying for BICS will need to provide verifiable evidence that they manufacture products included in eligible manufacturing frontier or manufacturing foundational Industrial Strategy industries.

Manufacturing frontier industries

Our proposal is that to receive BICS support businesses in manufacturing frontier industries must be within eligible Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and produce eligible ‘Harmonised System’(HS) products mapped to a SIC code in that frontier industry.

The Industrial Strategy published a list of SIC codes to define the frontier industries in the June 2025 white paper. These covered both services and manufacturing aspects of those sectors, which meant that SIC definitions were not feasible in some instances (for example, Clean Energy Industries, where service activities are spread across a wide range of codes).

However, BICS focuses on manufacturing activities, where SIC mapping is more feasible, although still challenging in more nascent sectors such as Clean Energy Industries and Digital and Technologies. DBT has produced more granular SIC mappings for manufacturing frontier industries for the purposes of delivering BICS. These are included in Annex A. Note that sectors listed in Annex A will not automatically be eligible for the scheme.

SIC mappings alone may not be sufficiently nuanced to identify eligible businesses. SIC mappings may capture businesses that manufacture products which are not primarily used in frontier industries. Similarly, companies may be producing frontier industry products, but these are only part of their production and/or they report under a different SIC.

This scheme will therefore use HS codes alongside SIC codes. The Harmonised System provides a list of codes for goods, which can be mapped to SIC codes using open-source methods. SIC codes are capped at the 4-digit level to correspond to NACE (Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la communauté européenne) and CPA (Classification of Products by Activity) rev 2.1 .

Using correspondence tables , these codes can then be attributed to the relevant HS6 code. The list of SIC codes are in the Annex A and HS codes in the proposed scope for BICS are included in the excel document accompanying this consultation (Annex B).

Our proposal is that to receive BICS support businesses in manufacturing frontier industries must be within eligible SICs and produce eligible HS products mapped to a SIC code in that frontier industry. This will allow government to objectively define who is operating in a frontier industry and producing associated goods.

However, we welcome feedback where businesses consider themselves to be clearly within the narrative definition of a frontier industry but are not captured by the proposed SIC and HS codes.

We will review the feedback and consider if the BICS list of SIC or HS codes need to be adapted. We are also considering if there are alternative approaches to scheme eligibility to better capture industries where SIC/HS code mapping is challenging and ensure consistency with other Industrial Strategy initiatives.

For example, we recognise that manufacturing frontier and manufacturing foundational industries can include a number of activities that support the circular economy within their specific industries. We welcome feedback where businesses engaged in this type of activity consider themselves within a narrative definition of an eligible manufacturing frontier industry or manufacturing foundational industry but may not be captured by the proposed SIC and HS codes.

This list of eligible SIC-4 industries and HS commodities will be made public before applications for the scheme open.

Note: HS codes are predominantly used by businesses and government to classify imports and exports of goods. They are being considered for use in the BICS methodology because they are a useful proxy for manufacturing activity. However, we recognise that they may be unfamiliar to businesses who are not engaged in international trade.

The application process for BICS will signpost applicants to the HS code look-up tool, which provides a simple way to identify the correct codes for the products they manufacture. There will be no requirement for a business to be an importer or exporter to access support under BICS.

Manufacturing foundational industries which supply the frontier industries

Our proposal is that to receive BICS support businesses in manufacturing foundational industries must be within eligible SIC codes.

The Industrial Strategy white paper and Technical Annex provides information on how foundational industries are identified and treated. See Annex A for the SIC codes identified in the initial analysis and published in the June 2025 Industrial Strategy.

As outlined in the Industrial Strategy Technical Annex, we will work with government’s new Supply Chain Centre to analyse and refine the list of important inputs into frontier industries. This will inform the creation of a more refined list of SIC-4 sectors within manufacturing foundational industries which provide important inputs to the frontier industries. The codes in Table 3 of Annex A are indicative and not guaranteed to be eligible for BICS.

This list of eligible SIC-4 industries will be made public before applications for the scheme open, alongside any further relevant information about eligibility.

As BICS provides support on manufactured products rather than services, service foundational industries are excluded. However, the manufactured products used by those service industries may fall in scope, for example the manufacture of electric cables, or the production of building materials, dependent upon the insights from the Supply Chain Centre analysis.

Note: The new Supply Chain Centre, based in DBT, will lead the government’s work, in tandem with business, to build resilience of the supply chains critical to the UK’s security and prosperity. The new Supply Chain Centre will review inputs required for our growth industries and national security, consider the impact of future trends on demand, and determine what action may be required to build resilience.

Criterion 2: eligible businesses must be manufacturers

Why we are targeting these businesses

As set out in the previous section on the rationale for the scheme, there is substantial evidence linking high electricity costs with decreasing investment and growth in manufacturing industries, leading to increased firm exits and job losses over the past 2 decades. Responses to the Industrial Strategy consultation also showed that there was a clear demand for intervention on electricity costs in manufacturing sectors.

How this test will be administered

This scheme will filter for manufacturing activity at both the sectoral and business level. Only manufacturing frontier industries within the IS-8 manufacturing sectors and manufacturing foundational industries will be in scope for support.

We intend to identify manufacturers within these sectors using a combination of SIC and HS code information submitted by applicants, in line with the methodology outlined in this document.

Criterion 3: eligible businesses must meet the required level of electricity intensity

Why we are targeting these businesses

The purpose of introducing an electricity intensity threshold is to increase efficiency of the scheme by targeting support to sectors and businesses which will be more responsive to electricity price changes. This ensures the support will make a meaningful difference to growth and investment.

How this test will be administered

This test can be applied at the sector and/or business level. We are considering which is the most appropriate combination of tests to administer.

The sector-level electricity intensity test. Sectoral electricity intensity will be calculated by DBT using the most recent Annual Business Survey and Annual Purchasing Survey Data available.

The intensity will be calculated as the electricity consumption as a proportion of measures of economic activity such as total expenditures or gross value added (GVA). Details of the threshold for the electricity intensity test, and a list of sectors which pass the test (and are therefore eligible for support), would then be provided to businesses.

The business-level electricity intensity test. Under this approach, applicants would be required to provide evidence of their business’s level of electricity intensity and would only be eligible if this figure exceeds the threshold defined by DBT. This threshold would be determined based on comprehensive modelling of a business level test’s impact, and details would be shared before applications open.

There are also multiple possible ways to measure electricity intensity.

We have identified 2 options for consideration:

option 1: electricity intensity could be calculated as (total electricity expenditure/Gross Value Added). This is the measure of electricity intensity used by several other electricity price support schemes, such as the British Industrial Supercharger

option 2: electricity intensity could be calculated as (total electricity expenditure/total expenditure). This measure focuses on the importance of electricity costs in the cost base

Pro-rating exemptions

It is likely that many businesses will produce a mixture of both eligible and ineligible products. To accommodate this, we are consulting on the option to administer exemptions on a pro-rated basis. The options in scope are presented for consultation.

Option 1: exemptions are pro-rated

Under the pro-rating approach, applicants would need to provide verifiable evidence of the percentage of their output comprised of eligible products. Rather than receiving a 100% exemption from the relevant levy costs, they would receive a proportional exemption.

For consultation, we are proposing 2 different options as to how this could be calculated:

option 1a: pro-rating based on proportion of revenue generated by eligible products

option 1b: pro-rating based on proportion of electricity usage used in the manufacture of eligible products

Example A illustrates how each of these approaches could work in practice.

Example A: pro-rating based on revenue

A business produces 2 products, Product A and Product B. Product A accounts for 65% of the firm’s revenue, and Product B accounts for 35%.

The HS code for Product A is included in the eligible list, while the HS code for Product B is not. The business would therefore be eligible for an exemption from 65% of the costs of the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs, and Capacity Market schemes, provided it meets the other eligibility criteria.

Example B: pro-rating based on energy usage

A business operates 2 sites, Site A and Site B. 100% of the energy used at Site A contributes to the manufacture of eligible products, while Site B manufactures no eligible products and therefore 0% of the energy used is eligible.

The business would be eligible for an exemption in proportion to the electricity used to produce eligible products. This means it would receive an exemption from Renewables Obligation, Feed-In Tariffs, and Capacity Market costs for all of the electricity used at Site A, but not for the electricity used at Site B.

Pro-rating would allow the scheme to target eligible activities more precisely. Eligibility would not be restricted only to businesses whose primary product(s) are eligible. Any firm which produces a relevant product, even if it is a smaller part of their overall business, may be able to receive support, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria.

However, many beneficiaries would receive a lower value of exemption under this approach when compared to the option without pro-rating. Only businesses which exclusively manufacture products within Industrial Strategy sectors would be eligible for a full exemption from the relevant levy costs; all other eligible businesses would receive partial exemptions.

In addition, this approach is likely to be more complex for government, applicants and energy suppliers to administer. Applicants would need to provide details of how their output breaks down between eligible and ineligible products, in a form that can be verified by scheme administrators. Suppliers may require more complex processes to administer partial exemptions to the levies, as opposed to full exemptions.

Option 2: exemptions are not pro-rated

Under the non-pro-rating approach, all businesses which meet the eligibility criteria would be exempt from 100% of the relevant levy costs. For businesses producing both eligible and ineligible products, there would be an additional test to determine if they, as a whole, operate in an Industrial Strategy sector.

This may include a minimum requirement for proportion of eligible activity. This consultation includes a question on the most suitable way to approach eligible businesses in these circumstances.

An approach that does not include pro-rating is likely to result in a narrower cohort of eligible businesses, with a greater benefit for businesses which meet the criteria. However, this approach carries a risk of potential distortive effects in sectors outside the scope of the Industrial Strategy. Businesses which predominantly produce eligible products, but have some output in ineligible sectors, may be able to pass their cost savings through to the non-eligible portion of their business, in a way which gives them an advantage over other businesses in those sectors who are not eligible for support.

Scheme cost control

It is vital that we have robust measures in place to manage the ongoing costs of BICS and that costs do not exceed the savings – as made clear in the government’s Modern Industrial Strategy – that will be realised by bearing down on levies and other costs in the energy system. The primary method of controlling costs will be through applying the eligibility criteria as outlined – specifically exercising discretion on the level of the sector and/or business-level electricity intensity test.

We welcome feedback on the merits of additional measures, for example, modest year-on-year adjustments to the overall level of exemption available to eligible businesses, to control the cost of BICS alongside the level of sector- and/or business-level electricity intensity test. We welcome views on how such measures may impact business and investment decisions and suppliers when administering the proposed exemptions.

Future scheme conditionality or flexibility

Ensuring businesses have a sustainable way of managing their energy costs in the long term is integral to delivering the growth this government seeks to achieve. This can be supported through the uptake of baseline energy flexibility and efficiency technologies in these sectors as they grow, allowing the system benefits and business savings to naturally grow with them.

For industrial energy users specifically, businesses of all sizes may be able to save by using electricity flexibly. These electricity optimisation processes can increasingly be automated within defined ranges, such as by setting a defined temperature zone on a freezer system, so that business processes are unaffected.

On a system level, integrating energy flexibility and efficiency will help to shorten network connection times for businesses generally and reduce energy demand peaks that require reinforcement work at both transmission and distribution level. Ultimately, this lowers electricity system costs and bills for all consumers, which is central to this government’s Clean Energy Superpower and growth missions

A critical barrier that currently prevents industrial participation in flexibility services is outdated building management systems. This can pertain to a lack of adequate and appropriate metering technology, or to a lack of smart systems preventing flexibility from being automated. Consequently, the journey for many businesses in becoming ‘flexibility ready’ and enabling participation can vary.

We welcome views on whether you agree with the principle of linking flexibility readiness to participation in the scheme or differentiated benefits, and this being considered at the 2030 review point. We also want to identify the opportunities and challenges this might present, including potential benefits for the system and businesses, impact on business and investor confidence and any technical, financial or operational implications.

Application process and evidence requirements

We aim to create a simple and accessible application process for businesses to apply for the scheme, prove eligibility and subsequently manage their exemption (for example, by adding new electricity meters, changing business details and applying for periodic renewals of their exemption certificate). We are looking to identify the simplest possible process for applying, which is robust against fraud, but not excessively burdensome for applicants.

Under current proposals, businesses will be required to provide evidence to demonstrate eligibility for BICS.

This evidence could include:

company name

company registration number

eligible SIC code(s) matching Companies House records

eligible HS code(s)

energy supplier

relevant Meter Point Administration Number(s)

evidence of the percentage of firm revenue generated by eligible activities

We will put in place a robust verification system to validate the submitted information and prevent fraudulent claims for support. If the application is approved, the company would be granted an exemption certificate containing all of the required evidence (including the exemption percentage proportionate to eligible activity), which will be provided to energy suppliers to deliver exemptions onto businesses’ electricity bills. Where reasonable, an appeals process will be available for businesses who believe they are eligible but have not been granted an exemption certificate following verification.

We will work closely with suppliers to explore requirements and costs related to system changes and support them to implement the scheme in a robust and cost-effective manner. This will include through specific engagement that will run in conjunction with this consultation.

For more than 50 years, chains like Wawa, Sheetz, and Love’s Travel Stops have defined when and where people refuel.
“What EV charging needs is a competitive and lucrative marketplace where folks can actually make money selling EV charging,” he said.
For some retailers, chargers are a loss leader meant to pull customers into stores, said Karl Doenges of the National Association of Convenience Stores.
Nonetheless, at least some of those companies see this as a difficult moment for EV charging.","Phillip Stafford has been converted. After two years driving a Tesla, he says there’s no going back to gasoline — the money he saves on fuel alone makes that clear. And since his work as a crisis counselor takes him all over Richmond, Virginia, he charges often.

That’s made him picky about where he buys electrons. On a crisp fall afternoon last month, Stafford had his Model 3 plugged in at a Sheetz. A red and white Wawa sandwich wrapper on the seat hinted at where his heart lies in that convenience store rivalry. Still, brand loyalty only goes so far when the battery is running low. Given a choice between the two, Sheetz wins. “It has more watts, so it charges a little faster,” he said.

The seemingly small question of where to spend 20 or so minutes topping off a battery reveals the transformation taking hold among fuel retailers. For more than 50 years, chains like Wawa, Sheetz, and Love’s Travel Stops have defined when and where people refuel. As EVs reshape mobility, they are among the retailers embracing charging.

Their challenge goes beyond providing power to turning the time drivers spend plugged in into profitable foot traffic. Selling electricity alone won’t pay the bills; the real money lies in selling snacks. Making that work requires reimagining what a pit stop looks and feels like, even as costly infrastructure upgrades and shifting federal policies complicate the transition.

Wawa and Sheetz are among the furthest along. The Pennsylvania-based companies have built out hundreds of chargers and enjoy fervent fanbases that make them two of the most popular convenience stores in the country. Their made-to-order sandwiches, vast array of snacks, and clean restrooms have made them regular stops for road trippers and commuters alike — and now, for EV drivers looking to recharge their cars and, often, themselves.

They offer a glimpse of the road ahead. As electric vehicles move ever further from niche toward norm, the focus for retailers like these could shift from who offers the cheapest fuel to who can make waiting for the car to fill up the best experience.

“The problem with a lot of current gas stations is [they’re] not that nice of a place to spend 15, 20, or 30 minutes,” said Scott Hardman of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California-Davis. “Hopefully in the future, we’ll see more of them turn into coffee shops, cafes — places you actually want to be.”

That future is slowly coming into focus. Retailers like Wawa and Sheetz have spent the past few years exploring what the transition from selling gasoline to selling electricity might look like. Even with the headwinds EVs face, at least 26 percent of cars on U.S. roads could be electric by 2035, and some projections suggest they could account for 65 percent of all sales by 2050.

The two chains offer a place to plug in at roughly 10 percent of their locations. Wawa has installed more than 210 chargers, while Sheetz provides more than 650 at 95 locations that have logged more than 2 million sessions. Clean amenities and expansive menus with offerings like Wawa’s turkey-stuffed Gobbler and Sheetz’s deep-fried Big Mozz have placed them near the top of convenience store satisfaction rankings.

Both say embracing cars with cords builds on what already attracts customers. Wawa frames it as an extension of its “one-stop” model for food and fuel. Its competitor calls charging “a seamless extension of the Sheetz experience.” The language differs, but the message is the same: Selling electricity works if it brings people like John Baiano inside.

The New York resident owns two Tesla Model Ys and travels throughout the northeast for his two businesses, a Bitcoin consultancy and a horse racing operation. He plugs in at Wawa because the stores are clean, offer plenty of amenities, and provide a comfortable place to check in with clients. “I use the bathroom, maybe get a snack,” he said. (He prefers the turkey pinwheel.) “I was a little nervous about the charging aspect of things. Once I started experiencing this, it was seamless.”

At the moment, most public quick chargers are tucked away in the far corners of shopping centers, inside parking garages, and other functional but hardly inviting places to spend 20 minutes. They’re fine when you’re out and about running errands, but not terribly appealing at night and not particularly conducive to a road trip.

Tesla dominates the space with its Supercharger network, which provides over half the country’s quick chargers, with Electrify America, EVGo, and ChargePoint together accounting for another 25 to 30 percent. Retailers like Love’s Travel Stops, Pilot Flying J, and Buc-ee’s are joining Sheetz and Wawa in working with those networks and others to add chargers alongside gas pumps. Their efforts signal how a system built for gasoline is starting to evolve for electricity.

Everything Stafford and Baiano like about plugging in at a convenience store reflects an Electric Vehicle Council study that ranked security, lighting, and 24/7 access as three things drivers most want in a charging station. Another survey found that 80 percent of them will go out of their way to get it. Reliability is another concern — and a frequent complaint with the nation’s current charging infrastructure. As EVs become more common, drivers are going to be less willing to put up with malfunctioning or broken chargers than the early adopters were.

Ryan McKinnon of the Charge Ahead Partnership, which pushes for a comprehensive charging network, sees fuel retailers as a logical place to build out such a system because they already have the right locations and amenities. “What EV charging needs is a competitive and lucrative marketplace where folks can actually make money selling EV charging,” he said.

Therein lies the challenge. Buying and installing a quick charger can cost more than $100,000. Beyond that lie fluctuating prices from utility companies, which one leading charging provider said is a key factor in deciding where to locate the devices. Retailers won’t recover that by selling electrons alone, given that the machines might generate just $10,000 in revenue each year, Hardman said. EVGo noted in its second quarter earnings report that it earned just under $12,000 per stall.

Making this work for retailers requires getting people out of their cars and into the stores. Just as gas retailers earn two-thirds of their profit selling sandwiches, snacks, and sodas, those selling electricity can expect to do the same. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that installing an EV charger increased spending by 1 percent, which would cover 11 percent of the cost of installing the charger. (Other studies have found similar benefits for surrounding businesses; Tesla Superchargers can boost revenue by 4 percent.)

For some retailers, chargers are a loss leader meant to pull customers into stores, said Karl Doenges of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Others see them as a way to secure increasingly scarce electrical capacity while it’s available. Some are moving “forward on a charging station, even though they don’t think [the market is] 100 percent ready,” he said.

Even the strongest business cases for installing the devices depended on Washington’s help to pencil out. Incentives the Biden administration created through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided billions in grants, tax credits, and matching funds to help expand the fueling infrastructure of tomorrow, particularly in rural and low-income communities that a free market might overlook.

When Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, there was little doubt federal support for this ambitious effort would change. Yet the upheaval was more dramatic than expected. In February, the Trump administration paused the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, the backbone of Washington’s effort to build a nationwide charging network. Fuel retailers, which have been some of the effort’s biggest beneficiaries, expressed concern.

The administration reluctantly reinstated NEVI, which had installed just 126 charging ports by the time Trump won his second term, in August. “If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the time. But with most of the funding allocated, the program will likely expire in 2026.

When it revived NEVI, the Trump administration updated recommendations for states, which administer the funds, in a way that seems to favor a national network run by big chains with highway operations. The Federal Highway Administration’s guidance explicitly recommended building charging infrastructure near fuel retailers.

Nonetheless, at least some of those companies see this as a difficult moment for EV charging. Joe Sheetz, executive vice chairman of the family-owned company, has said momentum is slowing because much of the funding has come from the government and big players like Tesla. Some smaller chains are backing away, but Sheetz said his company will keep at it.

Even as EV adoption grows, most people will continue to plug in largely at home. About 80 percent of charging occurs there, and some providers, like It’s Electric, are skipping partnerships with fuel retailers, focusing instead on slower and cheaper level 2 chargers that are convenient for apartments or homes without garages and do the job in four to 10 hours.

Charles Gerena, a lead organizer of the advocacy organization Drive Electric RVA, rarely visits a public charger in his Chevy Bolt. But on longer trips, he’s noticed more opportunities to plug in, especially in rural areas where fast charging was once scarce. On a recent road trip to Virginia Beach in his wife’s Ford Mustang Mach-E, he took advantage of the car’s ability to tap the Tesla Supercharger network and used the PlugShare app to find a reliable station — at a Wawa.

“I like Wawa’s food better than Sheetz,” he said. “I think I’m in the minority. My daughter actually likes Sheetz better.” Still, for Gerena, reliability trumps loyalty. “If it gets a lousy rating, I’d be wary of going to it, regardless of which gas station it was.”

Despite customer loyalty that can sometimes divide households, retailers are learning that sandwiches and snacks aren’t enough. Success will depend on providing plenty of opportunities to plug in, and making sure the hardware works when drivers need it.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wawa.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-24 07:00:23.475097

But that’s only a small part of the picture: A much, much larger share of data center water-intensity is indirect, a byproduct of the facilities’ enormous appetites for energy. That’s because most power plants themselves require huge amounts of water to operate. This off-site, indirect water consumption amounted to a whopping 211 billion gallons in the Berkeley lab’s 2023 tally — well over 10 times the direct on-site usage. As Silicon Valley continues to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence and demand for data centers grows, these water needs are only going to grow in tandem.

However, new research from Cornell University shows that there’s a way to mitigate both the climate and water footprints of these facilities: build them in places with lots of wind and solar energy. “Location really matters,” said Fengqi You, an energy systems engineering professor at Cornell and co-author of the new study. Where companies choose to locate their data centers could alter their combined environmental footprints by a factor of up to 100.

In the course of their operations, data centers use water as a coolant. Energy-hungry servers generate substantial heat, and water circulates through cooling systems to prevent the equipment from overheating and breaking down. But substantial amounts of water are also used indirectly through the generation of electricity to run the facilities. Thermoelectric power plants, regardless of whether they use coal, gas, or nuclear material, use that fuel to generate heat that converts water into steam, which is then used to spin a turbine and generate electricity. And since hydroelectric plants typically store large volumes of water in reservoirs behind dams, there is water loss there as well, as water continually evaporates from the surface of reservoirs.

All told, water use during power generation can be responsible for more than 70 percent of a data center’s total water consumption, according to the new Cornell research. “That’s why the electricity power grid mix is very critical,” said You.

You and his co-authors examined the energy and water use of data centers across the country to project where future investments should be made to reduce environmental impacts. The study assumes that the data center boom, which is being fueled by staggering levels of investment in artificial intelligence, is unlikely to slow down anytime soon. Against that backdrop, the question the study then poses is: Where in the country is the most environmentally sustainable place to build a data center?

The researchers considered both the direct and indirect uses of energy and water as a result of building a data center in a specific location. The most promising region they identified might turn heads: bone-dry West Texas. But because the region is sparsely populated, has groundwater that can be drawn on for use as a coolant, and produces ample wind energy, it scored highest on both energy and water stress metrics. In fact, the grid-related water footprint in West Texas is among the lowest in the country, thanks to the large amount of wind energy produced, according to the study.

“From an energy and water efficiency perspective, the states that have enough dry renewables will be the best choice,” said You, adding that Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota all appear to be prime locations for future AI servers, alongside the Lone Star State.

Conversely, most parts of the Pacific Northwest didn’t score as well because of the region’s reliance on hydropower. Although the cost of electricity is low in the area, the associated loss of water through power generation means that building more data centers is likely to have a substantially larger water footprint than it would in other parts of the country.

Another recent study from researchers at Purdue University came to a similar conclusion. They looked at the availability of water across the country and mapped out how that might change over time, particularly as climate change makes some regions hotter and drier. The researchers also examined the water impact of existing Google data centers and found that the majority were located in areas with low water stress.

“Companies absolutely take the environment into consideration in their decisions — not just the economic factor,” said Yi Ding, one of the authors of the paper and an electrical and computer engineering professor at Purdue. “We infer that Google already somewhat considered water stress because they put most of the data centers in low-stress regions.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2236721497-e1763760608494.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-24 04:59:18.808837

Ambassadors and colleagues. Welcome to the 172nd meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives (CPR).

Today, we will focus on preparations for the upcoming Open-Ended CPR (OECPR) and the seventh session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-7). Before we get into those details, please allow me to update you on some key developments that have relevance for UNEA – not just for this session, but for the long-term future of the assembly.

I will begin with the findings of UNEP’s Emissions Gap and Adaptation Gap reports, as they are crucial to understanding where we are with respect to climate change and where we need to be.

While we have made some progress, the world remains off track to deliver commitments made under the Paris Agreement. 117 new Nationally Determined Contributions have been submitted by countries, but, as our data shows, we still need much greater ambition as global warming projections over this century are 2.3-2.5°C. The multi-decadal average of global temperatures will exceed 1.5°C, very likely within the next decade.

So, we still need rapid and unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions – to make this overshoot minimal and temporary and to reduce an escalation of costly climate impacts. And as we hurtle towards greater climate damage, developing countries will need adaptation finance of US$310 to US$365 billion per year by 2035 – 12 times as much as current international public adaptation finance flows. The world is simply not prepared for what is coming.

UNEP took this message to COP30, called by many ‘the implementation COP’.

And here, please allow me to express my deep appreciation to the government and people of Brazil for hosting us at the gateway to the Amazon in Belem. I think it was a stroke of genius to place the COP in this complex setting, where the real world meets climate change. Where the pressures on the forests are real and tangible. Where Indigenous People voices are clear and loud. Where the rain comes not in drops, but in buckets. Where nature is lush and vibrant. And where heat and humidity are so high that you long for the blast of the air conditioner, come what may. Not a wealthy city. But a city light, vibrant, and alive – leaning to green solutions and possibilities.

And while achieving progress in challenging geopolitical times is never guaranteed, Belém showed that the Paris Agreement is working. The talks delivered a call to triple adaptation finance by 2035, a Just Transition Mechanism, new dialogues on how trade can support climate-resilient economic transformation and more.

COP30 also reinforced growing global momentum, inside and outside the negotiating halls, to transition away from fossil fuels, as agreed at COP28. To halt deforestation – including through the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which now stands at US$6.7 billion. And to pursue rapid, high-impact measures such as cutting methane emissions. The Action Agenda, the foundation to an inclusive COP that saw unprecedented Indigenous Peoples leadership from the Amazon and across the world, reinforced that this momentum is coming from all sources.

No one is saying that we are on track. But proven solutions do exist and are right in front of us. A pathway remains to meet our global commitments. Countries should see their new national climate plans as a baseline to build on, not a ceiling for ambition.

Keeping 1.5°C within reach requires us to accelerate the era of implementation at an unprecedented rate, so that we can deliver what people deserve: affordable clean energy, good jobs, clean air, and a safer, more-resilient future for all. And we have to better finance, implement and prioritise adaptation efforts.

UNEP will support the drive to bring down emissions and adapt to climate change, including through new initiatives launched at COP30. For example, UNEP teamed up with the Brazilian Presidency to launch the Beat the Heat implementation drive, with over 150 cities signing up in support of efforts to adapt to climate change in urban environments and reduce emissions through passive, nature-based cooling.

Excellencies,

Another crucial issue is the environmental impact of armed conflict and climate-related risks to peace and security. Prior to the COP, I was invited by the Presidency of the UN Security Council, Sierra Leone, to brief the Council on this issue. I made the point that climate change exacerbates tensions and can, under some circumstances, contribute to conflicts. I also made the point that conflict-related environmental damage can push people into hunger, disease and displacement – as we have seen in Gaza, the Sudan, the DRC, Ukraine and elsewhere. For Gaza, I hope that the recent ceasefire will be upheld by all parties and fully implemented so that it can turn into a long-lasting peace that will allow for a full recovery, including of the environment, backed by international support.

In this regard, in the Security Council, I called for all conflict-affected countries to be supported with tools to protect natural resources and the environment and provided three priorities that the Security Council could engage on: rebuilding national capacity for environmental management, facilitating and enabling work across sectors, and increasing investments in climate adaptation in conflict-affected countries.

During the high-level week of the 80th UN General Assembly (UNGA), we also saw climate change high on the agenda, as well as overwhelming support for the text of the first UN global political declaration on responding to noncommunicable diseases and mental health in an integrated manner. The declaration called for efforts to address the environmental determinants of health, which is central to UNEP’s work – from reducing air pollution to limiting exposure to hazardous substances and chemicals. And, of course, when we talk about mental health, we know that spending time in nature reduces stress and anxiety. UNEP clearly has a leading role to play in this space.

UN80 and UN reform were also welcomed at UNGA. As you know, UNEP is engaged in a reform process to strengthen environmental support for the three pillars of the UN charter – peace, human rights and development – and to address fragmentation of the UN environmental architecture.

We now have a UN80 Action Plan, which has been distributed to Member States. Work package 27 of this Plan, led by me and Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is to “undertake a thorough assessment of current arrangements and make proposals on possible structural changes and programme realignments on environmental issues”.

UNEP has always sought to be cost efficient and responsive. You are aware that UNEP undertook a Functional Review in the context of UN80 to identify cost reductions and to create a more agile streamlined and forward-looking organization. This coming Thursday, I will provide a briefing to delegations on the key outcomes of the Functional Review. Last week, the Directors of the Corporate Services Division and the Policy and Programme Division also briefed you on the resource mobilization strategy and how UNEP could offer more-impactful and results-driven delivery.

The delivery of these necessary changes for the organization’s future is possible only if UNEP’s core fund, the Environment Fund, is adequately resourced. Let me therefore invite all Member States who have not yet contributed in 2025 to do so as soon as possible.

Excellencies, now let us turn to UNEA-7 itself.

The informal consultations on the draft resolutions and decisions, which began on 18 September, concluded on 14 November. This was an important milestone. Over the past weeks, proponents have introduced their draft resolutions and decisions, engaged in constructive question-and-answer sessions, submitted revised drafts, and completed a full first reading of most drafts with textual proposals.

We now have 19 draft decisions and resolutions. I am pleased to see that there are drafts on AI, on minerals and metals and on issues related to the hydrological cycle and many other areas, some of which were priority areas highlighted in the first part of my report to UNEA-7.

The progress made during the intersessional period is encouraging and significant. When we come to the OECPR, Member States will have advanced versions of the texts in hand, allowing negotiations to begin from a more informed and mature starting point. This is how we strengthen the OECPR’s effectiveness and ensure that the process delivers outcomes that are both ambitious and implementable.

My thanks to the co-facilitators for their leadership and to all delegations for their active and constructive participation. I am also aware that the co-facilitators are already working diligently on cross-cutting issues – work that will be essential to building convergence and addressing linkages in a coherent manner.

Let me also acknowledge the efforts invested last week, when the Bureau and co-facilitators undertook three intensive days of further familiarization with the UN processes and the co-facilitator role. This kind of preparation – practical, focused and collaborative – is exactly what enables the OECPR to function as the strong and solution-oriented body it is meant to be.

All of this gives me confidence. We are entering the OECPR well prepared, with solid groundwork laid and a clear sense of direction. UNEP will support you every step of the way as we move toward a successful OECPR and, ultimately, a strong UNEA-7.

Excellencies,

Let us also remember that this is moment for UNEA and the CPR to lean into the UN80 space. This is a moment for real leadership.

Just to reiterate some of what I said in the second part of my report to UNEA, we must now look hard at how to unleash UNEA’s full potential as the world’s highest level global environmental forum and decision-making body. At how to make UNEA more focused, strategic and responsive – with meaningful resolutions that Ministers and cabinets in capitals will back and implement, with strong technical and scientific support from UNEP and the trifecta of science-policy panels. And at how to ensure that UNEA and UNEP knit together the work of Multilateral Environmental Agreements, and other bodies and initiatives, in a way that is consistent with the drive for united and efficient action under Work Package 27.

We are in a period of change. It is up to us all to shape this change so that the CPR, UNEA and UNEP emerge stronger. Sharper. Better able to support the UN system and Member States to stabilize the climate; restore nature, land and biodiversity; and decrease pollution and waste. And ultimately deliver a better future for the billions of people we serve across the world.

That’s where the EV Readiness program comes in, helping municipalities increase charging stations and educate residents on EVs and the incentives that are still available.

Despite the troubling federal outlook, Botero said, “the silver lining is Illinois is extremely committed to EVs.”","In the waning days of the Biden administration, the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus announced an award of $14.5 million in federal funds to build almost 200 EV charging stations across the Chicago area.

A few weeks later, after President Donald Trump had taken office, the funds were “gone,” as the caucus’ environmental initiatives director, Edith Makra, put it. One of Trump’s earliest actions was to suspend the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program, which is where the money for the Chicago-area charging effort had come from.

The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus is forging ahead with its EV Readiness program anyway. Even without the funds, there’s much it can do to help Chicago-area towns and cities get more chargers in the ground and EVs on the road. In fact, the caucus has already been doing that work for the last three years, thanks to funding from the Illinois utility ComEd.

Leaders say it’s an example of how local programs can make progress even when federal dollars are ripped away. It’s also a way to help meet Illinois’ ambitious goal of placing 1 million EVs on the state’s roads by 2030, a major leap from the roughly 160,000 registered as of November.

This fall, the caucus launched its fourth EV Readiness cohort, wherein representatives of 16 municipalities will learn how to upgrade their permitting and zoning processes related to EV charging, raise awareness about EVs and state and local incentives, and craft mandates for charging access.

Since 2022, 38 communities have gone through the program, and state data shows that EV registrations in most of these communities have increased faster than in the state as a whole.

More than money

Cost is one of the core factors holding back EV adoption in Illinois, and beyond.

Trump administration policies have made that hurdle even higher. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, rebates of $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones expired in September, while the federal tax credit for EV chargers will disappear in June 2026.

But price is not the only factor, and as manufacturers manage to bring down costs, these other barriers will become even more crucial to address.

For example, many people hesitate to buy an electric vehicle because of range anxiety — the fear they will run out of battery and be unable to find a reliable charger. Or they may feel intimidated by the concept of an EV in general. That’s where the EV Readiness program comes in, helping municipalities increase charging stations and educate residents on EVs and the incentives that are still available.

Participating communities can achieve bronze, silver, or gold status by taking certain actions on a checklist of over 130 possible steps. These include nuanced zoning and permitting changes, like examining when chargers can be in the public right of way and processing permit applications for the equipment in 10 days or less.

Streamlining such regulations helps charging-station companies that want to do business in the area, and the owners of gas stations, apartment buildings, parking garages, corporations, and other locations who want to install ports.

Makra called EV-friendly zoning and permitting codes “a glide path for sensible development.”

“Municipalities have a big role to play in making charging infrastructure available to their communities,” added Cristina Botero, senior manager of beneficial electrification for ComEd, which funds the EV Readiness program as part of a state mandate called beneficial electrification. “This program is so effective because it’s helping the leadership of these communities understand what steps need to happen.”

The EV Readiness program also encourages municipalities to establish requirements for charging access in new construction and to train first responders to deal with EV battery fires. Participants can take steps to boost public awareness, too, informing residents about utility rate programs conducive to EV charging and creating a landing page about EVs on the town website.

“People sometimes think that the dollars are the only reason people are not transitioning to EVs,” said Botero. “But a big part of it is education.”

Across the map

The EV Readiness program has so far attracted a wide range of municipalities, from the EV-friendly and relatively high-income Highland Park to smaller communities that otherwise “do not stand out from a sustainability or transportation standpoint,” noted Makra.

“What’s so gratifying is to see the diversity in jurisdictions,” she said. “They’re stepping forward and saying, ‘This would be good for our community.’”

That diversity is reflected in the new cohort, too, which includes the wealthy Chicago suburb of Winnetka and the small farm town of Sandwich.

Glen Cole, assistant manager for the city of Rolling Meadows, said the EV Readiness program helps local governments make it easier for building owners and businesses to comply with state law, which requires that all parking spaces at new large multifamily buildings and at least one space at new smaller residences have the electrical infrastructure needed to one day install an EV charger.

Rolling Meadows is a leafy suburb of about 24,000 people. Along with Chicago, it became one of three municipalities to earn gold status in the cohort that finished this summer.

Before that designation, Rolling Meadows already hosted a number of EV chargers on-site at corporate employers, including aerospace firm Northrop Grumman and the Gallagher insurance company’s global headquarters. Seven chargers are also under construction at Rolling Meadows’ city hall. The city adopted an ordinance in February mandating that new or renovated gas stations have one EV fast-charger for every four fuel pumps, and that parking lots with 30 or more spots have EV chargers.

Cole said the EV Readiness program helped advance the city’s progress

“The biggest part for us was putting in one place all these standards and expectations for an installer or investor or business, and incrementally easing into policy requirements to provide charging at public locations,” Cole said. “The availability of quick, easy, high-quality access to charging is a big determinant of whether people will take the leap to EVs, and it’s something the city can exercise a lot of control over.”

Utility leadership

Multiple items on the EV Readiness checklist require collaborating with ComEd and making the public aware of the utility’s EV incentives and billing plans conducive to charging.

ComEd, whose northern Illinois territory is home to 90% of the state’s EVs, offers rebates for households that install “smart” Level 2 EV chargers and covers the cost of any electrical work needed. In 2026, the maximum rebate will be $2,500, and could change with market conditions, according to the utility. ComEd also covers the cost of fast chargers and the “make-ready” construction and prep work for businesses and public agencies, and offers rebates for EV fleet vehicles.

The utility has paid out over $130 million for more than 8,700 charging ports and more than 2,700 fleet vehicles since early 2024, with 80% of the funds spent in communities identified as low-income or equity-eligible, per state law prioritizing investment in underserved communities. Low-income and equity-eligible customers receive higher rebates, and Botero said the utility has done extensive outreach in those areas, where the tax-credit expiration will make it especially hard for people to afford EVs.

“The opportunities we offer are more important than ever,” Botero said.

Botero said that after the Trump administration ended EV tax credits, the utility “went back to the drawing board” and increased the rebates it had previously planned for 2026, though some of the amounts will still be lower than in 2025. Incentives for light-duty vehicles in non-equity areas will end, but the utility will increase rebates for some types of vehicles in equity areas. For example, the 2026 rebate for electric school buses in those areas will be $220,000 to $240,000, up from $180,000 this year.

The state of Illinois offers $4,000 rebates for low-income EV buyers and a $2,000 rebate for those who don’t qualify as low-income. The state also this month started accepting applications for about $20 million in grants for public charging stations. In the third quarter of 2025, Illinois logged a record number of EV sales, mirroring national trends as people scrambled to buy EVs before the tax credits expired in September.

Despite the troubling federal outlook, Botero said, “the silver lining is Illinois is extremely committed to EVs.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/ff3097b2ec167a927aacd00c052351ea,N,,2025-11-24 07:00:27.973562

500 skilled clean energy jobs will be secured for workers in North Wales and the North West as 2 trailblazing carbon capture projects get ready for construction.

The UK’s first carbon capture-enabled cement plant at Padeswood, developed by Heidelberg Materials UK, and one of the world’s first full-scale carbon capture-enabled waste-to-energy facilities at Protos in Ellesmere Port, developed by Encyclis, have signed final contracts with government to begin construction. The 2 projects will provide highly skilled opportunities for Britain’s engineers, construction workers, technicians and health and safety experts.

Cement and waste-to-energy production are carbon-intensive and have no route to cut emissions without carbon capture. As the government accelerates to net zero, Padeswood and Protos will deploy world-leading technologies to remove 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 annually, forging a cleaner future with secure, long-term jobs for workers and businesses in the cement and waste-to-energy industries.

The projects will serve as the launch-point for exporting British technology, innovation and expertise abroad, creating economic opportunities for UK-based companies across the world - boosting growth and giving British business a competitive edge in the global green economy.

These are the first 2 anchor projects to join Eni’s Liverpool Bay Transportation & Storage network, part of the HyNet carbon capture cluster which was green-lit by the Prime Minister in April, after years of delay in getting the industry moving. As a key pillar of the modern Industrial Strategy, the government further backed carbon capture in June’s Spending Review with £9.4 billion over this Parliament to revitalise Britain’s industrial heartlands with good, skilled jobs for working people.

Today’s announcement is that investment in action - shovel-ready projects, jobs secured, and growth locked in for decades to come across North Wales and the North West.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth, and investment for local communities.

These trailblazing projects showcase North Wales and the North West’s workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

We are making the UK a clean energy superpower while delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

It is fantastic to see North Wales at the forefront of carbon capture and the hundreds of new jobs being created by these projects will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.

HyNet is a network of new and repurposed infrastructure, such as pipelines, spanning North Wales and the North West which will capture carbon emissions and store them safely underground.

Both projects have now signed contracts with the Low Carbon Contracts Company, marking their final investment decisions. With this milestone reached, projects are expected to move into the construction phase shortly. The projects directly support 500 skilled jobs, as part of the 2,800 jobs across the wider HyNet network.

Padeswood and Protos carbon capture projects also provide long-term job security for workers in the cement and waste industries by providing a crucial route to decarbonisation for the sectors, preserving these proud British industries as we reach net zero.

By investing in proven carbon capture technology, the government is positioning Britain as a global leader on net zero while protecting skilled manufacturing jobs for future generations.",,N,,2025-11-24 08:58:15.898847

The UK’s new Vision 2035 minerals strategy aims to secure lithium, rare earths and other critical materials to support advanced industries including clean energy, defense, semiconductors and emerging quantum technologies.

By expanding domestic refining, midstream processing and recycling capacity, the plan reduces reliance on concentrated global supply chains that also underpin superconducting, photonic and trapped-ion quantum hardware.

The strategy’s diversification targets, investment tools and defense-sector resilience measures position the UK to stabilize upstream inputs for future quantum processors, sensors and networking systems while strengthening broader industrial security.

The UK government laid out a sweeping plan to secure critical minerals through 2035, aiming to shield its high-tech industries from global supply-chain shocks while building domestic mining, refining and recycling capacity. The strategy, published as Vision 2035: Critical Minerals Strategy, targets sectors ranging from clean energy and advanced manufacturing to defense, digital infrastructure and, while not mentioned specifically, the quantum technology industry.

In essence, the policy outlines an effort to increase domestic production, expand midstream processing, diversify imports and create a circular economy for minerals essential to modern hardware.

The strategy places significant emphasis on lithium, rare earth elements, nickel, copper and a new category of “growth minerals,” which the UK expects will be central to economic expansion. Quantum technologies — like superconducting processors, trapped-ion systems, photonic chips and quantum sensors — depend heavily on many of the same materials. That overlap positions the quantum industry to be involved in a minerals policy crafted primarily with smart phones, batteries and clean energy in mind.

Supply Chains for Tomorrow’s Hardware

The government’s roadmap anticipates dramatic increases in demand for materials across advanced industries, adding that lithium demand, for example, could increase more than tenfold. The plan warns that concentrated global supply chains — especially in rare earths and midstream processing — have created strategic vulnerabilities that now ripple into sectors beyond electric vehicles or renewable energy. Quantum computing and sensing would likely fall into this category because they depend on ultra-pure metals, semiconductor feedstocks and rare-earth dopants used in photonics, superconducting circuits and precision measurement devices.

The UK’s experience with lithium, nickel, tin and rare-earth recycling highlights why the strategy could matter to quantum firms. Quantum processors require high-purity aluminum, copper, niobium, silicon and rare-earth elements used in optical amplifiers or quantum memories. Quantum sensors rely on specialty alloys, doped crystals and diamond substrates. As quantum prototypes scale toward commercial hardware, the industry faces the same upstream risks that challenge battery and semiconductor manufacturers. The minerals plan could be seen as a way to place the UK on a path to relieve some of those pressures.

The most immediate connection to the quantum sector lies in the government’s push to expand the country’s midstream processing — transforming mined or recycled materials into high-purity feedstocks suitable for manufacturing. The strategy singles out this stage of the value chain as a national competitive advantage, citing the country’s refining expertise, research institutions and industrial clusters in Cornwall, Wales, the North East and Northern Ireland.

Quantum hardware companies have struggled with midstream vulnerability, particularly in superconducting and photonic systems where purity levels must meet strict tolerances. The UK’s focus on building capacity for refining lithium, rare earths and specialty metals could give domestic quantum firms more stable access to critical inputs. It may also lower cost volatility by reducing exposure to overseas processors, especially in markets where supply is concentrated in a small number of countries.

The government’s investment mechanisms — including the National Wealth Fund, UK Export Finance and a new £50 million critical-minerals project fund — are structured to support capital-intensive projects that bridge mining, midstream processing and advanced manufacturing. Quantum firms that depend on rare-earth dopants, ultra-pure metals or semiconductor-grade materials may be able to align with these programs through supply-chain integration rather than direct mineral extraction.

Defense Stockpiling and Dual-Use Technologies

The plan also outlines new steps to strengthen mineral supply chains for the defense sector. The government is considering industry-led stockpiles and diversified sourcing requirements tied to procurement, aiming to reduce strategic dependence on any single country. Because quantum technology is increasingly treated as a dual-use capability — serving defense communications, navigation, sensing and code-breaking countermeasures — the sector is likely to be affected by these measures even though it is not explicitly named in the strategy.

Quantum processors rely on materials such as ytterbium, strontium, beryllium, high-purity gold, superconducting metals and rare-earth magnets used in trapping and control systems. Defense-aligned supply rules could impose higher sourcing standards and new reporting requirements on firms operating in or selling to the UK. They may also open new funding channels for quantum hardware suppliers who align with the UK’s mineral security posture.

A Circular Economy for High-Tech Materials

Recycling plays a central role in the government’s 2035 targets, which call for 20% of total UK mineral demand to be met via recovered materials. Today, recycling of many rare earths and specialty metals remains limited by low collection rates and high processing costs. The strategy views this as an opportunity, pointing to UK capabilities in platinum-group metals and early-stage rare-earth magnet recycling.

For quantum technologies, which have not yet reached a scale where recycling is a pressing issue, the long-term benefits could be substantial. As cryogenic systems, photonic modules and trapped-ion devices enter commercial service in the 2030s, recycling infrastructure for rare earths, superconducting alloys and high-purity metals will matter more. The report indicates that recycled sources of key minerals will increase sharply after 2030 as large energy systems reach end of life. That timeline aligns with forecasts for larger-scale quantum deployments, giving the industry a future pathway to more sustainable and less volatile input materials.

The strategy acknowledges that China dominates rare earth and midstream processing, controlling the majority of global refining capacity. The UK intends to maintain engagement with China while expanding partnerships with countries such as Canada, Australia, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. These partnerships cover long-term purchase contracts (called offtake agreements), joint project development, financing arrangements and technology exchange.

Quantum firms, particularly those developing photonic and superconducting systems, source materials from the same networks facing geopolitical tension. The UK’s effort to diversify imports and strengthen industry-to-industry ties may ease some of the supply-chain friction quantum hardware makers face as export controls tighten and markets become more protectionist.

The government’s diversification target, which aims to ensure that no single country provides more than 60% of any aggregated critical mineral supply, signals a move toward greater resilience across all high-tech sectors.",https://thequantuminsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-24-at-4.14.20-AM.png,N,,2025-11-24 06:00:32.208522

Maxvolt is building a complete circular ecosystem for lithium battery manufacturing and reuse. How does your Aligarh recycling plant fit into this strategy?

Our circular ecosystem is designed to cover the complete lifecycle of a battery from manufacturing to reuse and eventually recycling. Once fresh batteries are produced from raw materials sourced from our vendors, we also collect used or scrap batteries from customers through our exchange model. These used batteries are first evaluated to extract healthy cells, which are then repurposed into more miniature battery packs suitable for applications like electronic gadgets, toys, robotics, and compact backup devices. The remaining unusable materials are sent to our Aligarh recycling plant, where they are processed and segregated into different metals and materials. These recovered materials are then made available again for new battery production, completing the circular loop.

How will the company manage the flow of used batteries from collection to repurposing or recycling?

Our collection-to-recycling flow is designed to be seamless and customer-friendly. We offer attractive exchange values for returned batteries that are no longer fit for use in vehicles. Customers benefit from receiving good value for their scrap batteries, while we ensure the safe handover and responsible handling of these units. Usable components are repurposed for secondary applications, whereas the remainder is sent for proper recycling. This process not only lowers customer costs but also accelerates our recycling workflow while ensuring all materials are handled safely.

What environmental and business benefits do you foresee from integrating recycling with production?

Integrating recycling with production brings multiple environmental and business benefits. Environmentally, it ensures that scrap lithium cells are used to their full potential rather than ending up in landfills, where they would decompose improperly. Since the metals used in lithium batteries can be reused multiple times, recycling allows us to extract valuable materials from old batteries and convert them into new, usable components. From a business perspective, recycling creates a strong additional revenue stream and reduces dependence on fresh raw materials. It also supports long-term sustainability while boosting operational efficiency.

With 5x year-on-year revenue growth and a strong IPO response, what key factors are sustaining this momentum?

Our momentum is being driven primarily by strong customer satisfaction and continuous demand for our products. As customers experience reliable performance from our batteries, market demand naturally continues to rise. This consistent demand cycle has helped us maintain strong year-on-year revenue growth and has directly contributed to the positive response we received during our IPO.

How do you plan to balance domestic and international market expansion over the next few years?

Currently, our focus remains on the domestic market, as India presents a massive opportunity in the EV battery segment. The demand here is skyrocketing, and we aim to serve this market fully in the near term. Once our domestic supply is strong and stable, we plan to expand into international markets as well. That will allow us to take the strengths of our product to global users while continuing to grow our footprint.

What new customer segments or applications do you see emerging for lithium-ion technology in India?

We are seeing a significant increase in demand across multiple new segments, especially as the government is actively promoting renewable energy and new battery-based technologies. Most modern gadgets are now shifting to rechargeable formats, which naturally creates a greater need for lithium-ion solutions. As these trends accelerate, customer segments and application areas for lithium-ion batteries continue to expand across consumer electronics, mobility, small appliances, and digital devices.

Maxvolt has invested heavily in R&D. What are your current focus areas in lithium battery innovation and fast-changing technologies?

We continuously invest in R&D because lithium batteries are highly technical products, and the market demands the highest levels of safety and reliability. Our current focus is on enhancing battery safety, improving error-free performance, and developing systems that make batteries more user-friendly. Additionally, with the rise of fast-charging technology, especially on two-wheelers, we are working to make our batteries fully compatible with fast charging. This ensures longer battery life and greater convenience for users in line with evolving technological needs.

How are strategic collaborations helping Maxvolt expand its footprint in the EV and energy-storage markets?

Strategic collaborations are playing a key role in strengthening our growth. These partnerships enable us to enhance R&D, expand our manufacturing capability year after year, and accelerate our recycling initiatives. They also improve our market presence by helping us reach customers more directly through promotional and on-ground activities. Through these collaborations, end users gain better awareness of our products, their features, and the advantages of using Maxvolt batteries, which ultimately supports rapid market expansion.

How do Maxvolt’s manufacturing and recycling initiatives align with India’s clean energy and sustainability goals?

Our manufacturing and recycling efforts are closely aligned with India’s clean energy vision. By integrating recycling into our operations, we reduce waste and support a circular economy, thereby reducing the need for imported raw materials and contributing to national resource efficiency.

Countering Trump’s offshore wind claims The report’s conclusions stand in stark contrast to rhetoric coming from top officials implementing Trump’s war on offshore wind.
But when temperatures plummet, offshore wind power could be a huge cost-saver for many U.S. residents.","President Donald Trump has made it his mission to banish offshore wind farms from America. He has derided wind energy as unreliable and expensive while freezing permitting and halting projects already under construction.

Yet a new report suggests that the president’s moves could be working against grid reliability in key parts of the country. Along the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, offshore wind can play a critical role in keeping the lights on year-round, especially through the winter, according to a study published this month by New York City–based consultancy Charles River Associates.

Trump’s attacks on offshore wind and other renewable sectors come amid dire challenges for the nation’s power system. The world’s wealthiest companies are building power-hungry data centers as grid infrastructure ages and households’ energy bills skyrocket. The White House itself has declared an ​“energy emergency,” which it’s using to push for more fossil-gas, coal, and nuclear power plants.

But offshore wind is well suited to ​“meeting the moment,” in part because gas plants are reliable in the summer but can buckle under winter weather, according to the study. Ocean winds in the Northeast are at their strongest and steadiest in winter months, making turbines there a way to boost the reliability of power grids connected to underperforming gas plants.

Oliver Stover, a coauthor of the study, called offshore wind farms a ​“near-term solution,” saying that turbines at sea and gas plants on land complement each other throughout the Northeast’s changing seasons: ​“They’re stronger together.”

Stover explained that if grid reliability is the goal, it makes sense for planned offshore wind farms to reach completion. Those projects will help regional grids burdened by extreme winter weather and data-center demands ​“buy time” as more infrastructure is built.

“Every megawatt is a good megawatt,” he said.

All eyes on winter

The periods in which offshore wind performs best also align with the time of increasing grid strain: winter mornings and evenings, when people tend to crank up the heat. While peak electricity demand has historically happened during the summer months, it is shifting to these winter moments in many parts of the country, largely due to the mass electrification of space-heating systems.

That means securing power generation during colder months must be, according to Stover, ​“a priority going forward.”

Stover and his colleagues aren’t the first to underscore the reliability benefits of offshore wind. Other analysts, along with grid operators, have warned that Trump’s efforts to squash certain projects that East Coast states were planning to rely on could raise blackout risks and power bills in the region.

Take Revolution Wind: Trump paused construction of the Rhode Island project in August due to ​“national security concerns” that a federal judge said were not rooted in ​“factual findings.” Having won an injunction in court, developer Ørsted eventually resumed construction one month later.

But during the pause and amid mounting uncertainty over the project’s fate, ISO New England — the region’s grid operator — released a statement saying that delaying delivery of power from Revolution Wind ​“will increase risks to reliability.”

Susan Muller, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Canary Media that if Revolution Wind were killed, the impact would be most acutely felt in winter months. That’s when the region’s limited supply of fossil gas is stretched even thinner, since the fuel is used for both building heating and power generation.

Losing Revolution Wind’s electricity entirely would have cost New England consumers about $500 million a year, according to Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University. His estimation was based on the value that the offshore project had secured in ISO New England’s forward capacity market as well as its potential to supplant costlier power plants used during grid emergencies, like snowstorms.

“We don’t need a bunch of fancy studies to tell us that these units are needed for reliability,” Silverman told Canary Media in September during Revolution Wind’s government-ordered pause.

In Virginia, the world’s data-center capital, America’s largest offshore wind farm is slated to start generating power in March 2026. Trump has not yet targeted the 2.6-gigawatt project, but if it doesn’t come online as planned, the mid-Atlantic grid region run by PJM Interconnection would be less reliable and have higher electricity costs, this month’s study says.

In a large swath of the Mid-Atlantic region, offshore wind has one of the highest ​“resource-adequacy” scores among energy types, according to the study. In other words, when it comes to lowering the probability of blackouts there, offshore wind outcompetes all other types of renewable energy — and is even on par with the most efficient gas-fired power plants.

But the sector is not without its issues, Stover emphasized. Even before Trump’s anti-wind policies made investors skittish and permits no longer guaranteed, construction costs had been ballooning for years, given supply chain issues and inflation.

Offshore wind farms are also, by nature, megaprojects that come with inherent logistical hurdles. Just last month, New York’s Empire Wind lost the turbine-construction vessel it was banking on, due to a skirmish between two shipbuilding companies. Only a handful of boats in the world are capable of doing that kind of work.

Countering Trump’s offshore wind claims

The report’s conclusions stand in stark contrast to rhetoric coming from top officials implementing Trump’s war on offshore wind. The sector was just taking off in the U.S. when the president was inaugurated in January, with the first commercial-scale project coming on line last year and five more arrays now under construction.

“Under this administration, there is not a future for offshore wind because it is too expensive and not reliable enough,” Doug Burgum, secretary of the Interior Department, told an audience in September at a fossil-gas industry conference in Italy.

Burgum’s statements mirror some of Trump’s favorite talking points that have long misled the public about the risks of wind power. In September, Trump told the United Nations General Assembly in a speech that ​“windmills are so pathetic and bad” because of their unreliability, falsely claiming that wind power is ​“the most expensive energy ever conceived.”

The grid does not automatically face problems when ​“the wind doesn’t blow,” as Trump falsely claimed at the United Nations. Grid operators routinely handle the intermittent nature of power generation from multiple sources — whether it be solar, gas, or wind turbines — through grid-management techniques and, increasingly, battery storage.

While offshore wind energy is currently expensive, nuclear energy — a sector the Trump administration aims to boost — is typically the most expensive type of power.

Globally, power generated from wind turbines in the ocean is comparable to other sectors such as geothermal and coal when it comes to cost-competitiveness. In fact, offshore wind has become more cost-competitive relative to other power types in recent years as the sector has matured in Europe and China, according to the most recent analysis by financial advisory firm Lazard.

But when temperatures plummet, offshore wind power could be a huge cost-saver for many U.S. residents. One analysis found that in New England, if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of under-construction offshore wind farms had been online, households there could have saved $400 million on power bills last winter. In the coming months, cost savings and reliability will take center stage as Vineyard Wind, the region’s first large-scale offshore wind farm to break ground, feeds the grid for its first full winter season.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/OffshoreTurbineRhodeISlandGettyImages-589721018.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d9b06ac616e70c1c3f2ba191d97e753e,N,,2025-11-24 03:59:48.882910

GMB Scotland, one of the biggest unions across the energy sector, said nine out of ten members in oil and gas want the chancellor to cut the Energy Profits Levy in her budget on Wednesday to safeguard jobs, skills, and UK energy security.

The union’s polling also reveals eight out of ten (84 per cent) oil and gas workers do not believe UK or Scottish governments are capable of delivering a fair transition to renewable energy.

UK energy secretary Ed Miliband is promising 400,000 new jobs in green energy but, the poll suggests, nine out of ten (86 per cent) of GMB members do not believe renewables jobs will ever replace those lost in oil and gas.

Louise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary, said the snapshot survey of 250 oil and gas workers this week exposes their crushing lack of faith in ministers’ energy strategy and escalating fears over the rushed rundown of offshore production.

She said: “Our members are witnessing the needless and self-harming rush from oil and gas firsthand and their expert judgement could not be more damning.

“Ministers have stuck their fingers in their ears and ignored the voice of workers for too long but the warnings of industrial catastrophe are now deafening.

“Day after day, there are closures and redundancies in the oil and gas sector and across all the industries relying on it while we continue to be told of green jobs tomorrow.

“Tomorrow is too late, we need action today to slow the carnage and that must start with Wednesday's budget.”

The GMB Scotland poll revealed 84 per cent of oil and gas workers surveyed believe creating secure jobs should be the top priority for ministers during the transition to renewables.

Other priorities highlighted by the workers, with jobs offshore and in supply chains, include lowering household bills (79 per cent); ensuring an effective mix of energy sources (71 per cent); investment to allow more oil and gas exploration (66 per cent); and safeguarding energy security (65 per cent).

Almost every one of the workers (98 per cent) polled believe oil and gas will be essential in UK energy mix for years to come, however, and 77 per cent thought they would still be working in the sector in five years’ time.

Gilmour said the survey only confirmed how the drive to decarbonise will fail unless it is shaped by the expertise and insight of energy workers.

She said: “Experienced and skilled workers across oil and gas know better than anyone what the scale of this transition will demand and what is at stake.

“Promises of green jobs tomorrow mean nothing when real jobs are being lost today and, so far, this transition has been something done to our workers and their communities not with them.

BANGKOK, Thailand/RATANAKIRI, Cambodia — “When you touch the water of the O’Ta Bouk River, the mud will stick to your skin,” said Thao*. “It creates skin issues and we can’t catch fish this year anymore. It’s thick, like condensed milk. The oil from the machinery floats on the water surface, so it might affect our health, like our stomach or intestines.”

On the quiet banks where the Sesan River and O’Ta Bouk River (also known as the Prek Liang River) meet in the northeastern Cambodian province of Ratanakiri, Ta Bouk village is where Thao calls home. The O’Ta Bouk River flows some 90 kilometers (56 miles) through Virachey National Park, one of Cambodia’s oldest protected areas, before feeding into the Sesan River and providing water to Ta Bouk village, just 2 km (1.2 mi) from the park’s border.

The O’Ta Bouk has long sustained the Brao Indigenous communities who live, farm and fish along the river’s banks, providing them with clean, potable water for generations.

But Thao’s village is just one of the hundreds across the Mekong region that have seen their life-giving rivers poisoned by toxic runoff from an explosion of unregulated mining, much of this is driven by surging gold prices, rising demand for rare earth elements and limited government oversight or environmental standards.

Extensive satellite imagery analysis conducted by U.S. think tank the Stimson Center has uncovered 2,404 mines operational between 2014 and 2025 within river basins across the region — 114 of them identified as opening this year, and a further 182 appearing in satellite imagery in 2024.

Most of the mines identified, 1,868, are situated in Myanmar, and a significant amount, 518, are in Laos, along with one in Malaysia.

But even in Cambodia, where only 17 mines were found in close vicinity to rivers and streams, the impacts are already being felt keenly by communities that rely on rivers. In Thao’s case, the O’Ta Bouk River appears to be contaminated by a politically connected and unregulated gold mine upstream, that’s sending toxic runoff downstream into the Sesan River, a key tributary of the Mekong River and part of the 3S basin that includes the Sekong and Srepok rivers.

“In July, I experienced a skin issue with my foot after touching the water [from the O’Ta Bouk River],” Thao told Mongabay in November 2025. “After half an hour [my foot] was inflamed and itchy with small bumps on my skin. I went to buy medicine and after a week it disappeared.”

Thao, his sister and his 11-year-old son had all entered the water to bathe — and all developed red lesions on the parts of the skin that were submerged beneath the O’Ta Bouk. Thao showed reporters photos of his sister’s leg that were taken in July, shortly after they’d entered the water. Clusters of raised red welts can be seen speckled below his sister’s knee.

Ta Bouk village in Ta Veng district is home to more than 200 families, all of who rely heavily on the rivers and spend much of the year living and working on their plantations along the banks of the O’Ta Bouk.

Similar symptoms developed across members of the community who had entered the water, but few had access to health care; for some, Thao said, it took up to a month for the rashes to disappear.

Nearly 13 km (8 mi) northeast, further up the O’Ta Bouk River and nearly 6 km (3.7 mi) deep into Virachey National Park, lies the village of Mondul Yorn, where Chorn*, a former fisherman turned farmer, has had to abandon the water in the wake of the contamination. He also described developing itchy skin, red blemishes and inflammation after going into the O’Ta Bouk to fish.

“Before the [O’Ta Bouk] river changed I could catch 2-3 kilograms [4.4-6.6 pounds] of fish per day, but after the river changed, I had empty hands,” he said. “Now there’s no more fish in the river.”

Speaking with rangers from the provincial environmental department, who patrol within Virachey National Park that surrounds Mondol Yorn village, Chorn learned that gold mining operations had begun upstream. The rangers, he said, were convinced that the opening of gold mines between 2023 and 2024 was why the O’Ta Bouk River was devoid of fish and making people sick.

“I feel like [the company] wants to kill us, they don’t love us anymore. The river doesn’t pollute itself; it’s polluted by the company,” he said.

Tracking toxic rivers

As the Stimson Center data show, the poisoning of the O’Ta Bouk River is not an isolated incident. The spillover of chemicals associated with mining have long proved a problem for riverine communities in the Mekong region. Over the course of 2025, the situation on the Thai-Myanmar border has underscored the urgent need for government intervention on river pollution linked to unregulated mining operations.

But while these incidents have often been viewed as separate, the waterways that connect the Mekong region threaten to spread the problem downstream.

According to Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center’s energy, water and sustainability program in Southeast Asia, tributaries of the Mekong and the Irrawaddy rivers have the highest concentrations of mining operations. But, he said, the threat is spread across the Bilin, Irrawaddy, Salween and Sittaung river basins in Myanmar, the Lam, Ma and Mekong basins in Laos, and the Mekong Basin in Cambodia, potentially putting scores of rivers — and millions of people who depend on them — at risk from contamination.

“Testing on water, soil and sediment along these rivers should happen immediately with resources first allocated to the rivers with the highest number of mines and those that are home to the largest populations,” Eyler said. “Eventually, all rivers with mining activity should be tested. Testing should not be limited to the areas directly near the rivers’ channels because many of these rivers flood.”

Flooding, he warned, would see toxic water and sediment dispersed widely across floodplains, threatening agriculture and food security across the region. Testing the soil and groundwater of floodplains would allow authorities to tell people where it’s safe or not safe to plant crops.

Mines choke the region’s rivers

The mines identified by the Stimson Center’s satellite imagery analysis have largely not been confirmed with a visit to the site, or ground-truthed, but can be divided into three distinct types: alluvial mining, heap leaching mines extracting gold and other precious metals, and rare earth element mines.

“Alluvial mining for gold is the process of extracting sediment in the riverbed and along the riverside and extracting gold through various separation techniques including gravity techniques like sluicing, dredging and panning,” said Regan Kwan, lead researcher at the Stimson Center. “Mercury is often used alongside gravity techniques to improve the capture of gold through amalgamation.”

Between 2014 and 2025, the Stimson Center identified 1,342 alluvial mines, with 16 in Cambodia, 347 in Laos and 979 in Myanmar. But while these mines are thought to have a relatively short lifespan, the Stimson Center found 68 across the region that opened in 2024 and a further 17 that opened in 2025. Most of the mines identified are suspected to be gold mines. But without ground-truthing, it’s possible that some mining operations may be seeking tin, copper, nickel and other metals.

Another form of mining identified was heap leaching, which Kwan said entails gold ore being mined, crushed and heaped on top of an impermeable lining before being sprinkled with a sodium cyanide solution known as leacheate for several months. The cyanide dissolves the gold, and the gold-laden solution is extracted and separated from the liquid.

Only one heap leach mine was found in Cambodia by the Stimson Center; it identified 145 in Laos and 340 in Myanmar. Forty-two of the 486 total appeared to have opened in 2025, compared to 50 in 2024.

Both alluvial and heap leaching mining operations are mobile, Kwan said, with heap leaches lasting several months or longer and alluvial mines being exhausted even faster, but both have a tendency to be abandoned and then reestablished further along the river.

“As an example, observing a single river over two to three years demonstrates how miners move throughout the river system, leaving mined sites abandoned as vegetation slowly takes over the abandoned site,” Kwan said. “In both cases, there are no indications of any post-mining cleanup process or mitigation efforts.”

Chemicals, often stored in pools or tailing ponds, are often poorly contained across the region and are exposed to monsoon seasons, which can lead to chemical spillover flowing into rivers, streams and groundwater.

“The use of cyanide and mercury to separate and extract gold puts people and the environment at risk to prolonged and or concentrated exposure to the harmful chemicals,” Kwan said, detailing the various ways mercury poisoning affects the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems, along with causing symptoms described by residents across Ta Veng district.

But it’s not just people who stand to be affected: plants, animals and crops are all at risk from contamination from mercury, cyanide, chromium and heavy metals (often introduced as waste from the mining process), which threaten the soil upon which Southeast Asia’s agricultural economy is built.

In the case of Virachey National Park, the chemical contamination threatens at least 89 species of wildlife found in the park, including clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), gaur cattle (Bos gaurus), endangered Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and critically endangered Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica). Mining contamination throws the future of both Indigenous communities and threatened wildlife species into jeopardy, but the Cambodian government has so far not responded to the issue, which could flow further downstream if unaddressed.

“The region really lacks expertise in understanding how these chemicals and dangerous elements dilute as they move downstream,” said Eyler, of the Stimson Center. “Some are soluble and others are not. What we do know is that they can contaminate crops as they grow, fish and other biota in rivers, and are directly harmful to humans if consumed or exposed to the skin. A regional effort is required for effective testing and also effective messaging to people who may be exposed.”

Officials from Cambodia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Ministry of Environment could not be reached for comment on the matter.

Testing the water

As the health concerns mount, residents of Ta Bouk village been forced to find alternative sources of water, mostly by digging wells, fearing for their safety should they continue to use the O’Ta Bouk River for drinking, bathing, cooking and agriculture. Their concerns have gone largely ignored by local authorities, who Thao said have visited following complaints but didn’t conduct any testing in the O’Ta Bouk or on its banks. The riverbanks now lay sticky with a toxic mud after water levels rose in the monsoon season.

“The district authorities came between June-July this year [to inspect the O’Ta Bouk River] but there’s been no action,” he said. “The water has been muddy since May this year. After they came, nothing happened.”

Mongabay spoke with 10 people across three separate villages in Ta Veng district, eight of whom had personally contracted skin conditions from entering the river. All were deeply concerned by the risk of falling sick through coming into contact with contaminated water and felt the local authorities were powerless to do anything.

While authorities have been absent in the unfolding crisis in Ratanakiri’s waterways, Mongabay reporters conducted their own testing of both water and fish from the O’Ta Bouk and at the confluence of the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers, as well as soil from their banks. An independent laboratory confirmed that two fish caught from the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers contained significantly higher levels of mercury — 40.5 milligrams per kilo in the fish caught in the O’Ta Bouk and 20.8 mg/kg in the one from the Sesan — than is considered safe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends people avoid consuming fish containing 0.46 mg/kg of mercury.

Likewise, a soil sample taken from the banks of the O’Ta Bouk was found to contain 24.1 mg/kg of mercury, significantly above the 7.1 mg/kg level that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets as a benchmark for soil in residential areas. Water samples from both the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan tested positive for arsenic contamination, at 0.029 mg/liter and 0.035mg/l respectively — nearly three times higher than World Health Organization’s safe limit of 0.01 mg/l.

However, these samples only represent a snapshot of the water, soil and fish quality in both rivers, with Stimson Center experts urging more testing to be done in the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers, as well as downstream in the Mekong River to establish a baseline that will determine a policy response. One independent expert who reviewed Mongabay’s lab results noted that while natural processes could raise contamination levels, the proximity of the gold mine to the river was a more likely explanation for the unusually high concentrations of arsenic in the water and mercury in the fish and soil.

The unabated flow of toxic chemicals from the gold mining operations upstream has left Thao and his community with little hope for the future, where freshwater resources may become scarce in Ta Bouk village. Thao said the community is afraid of the contamination, with residents fearful of eating their own crops and vegetables, while noting that fish stocks have plummeted rapidly, plunging the villagers into hardship.

“If we can no longer use the water, we might have to migrate to find other jobs because we rely on the O’Ta Bouk River,” he said. “If there’s no river water, we’ll move from this area.

“There also might be issues with food security because the locals here produce food from this area,” he added. “Some families with enough money can dig a well, but those who are poor will have to move from this area because the water is the main source of living. The pollution could spread to the Sesan River and onto other areas, like Veun Sai.”

Eleven alluvial gold mines and the only heap leaching gold mine identified in Cambodia by the Stimson Center’s data set fall within or in close proximity to a 4,000-hectare (9,900-acre) economic land concession that was awarded to Global Green (Cambodia) Energy Development. Documents seen by Mongabay show the company had previously been granted an 18,900-hectare (46,700-acre) mining exploration license inside Virachey National Park. However, it remains unclear whether Global Green was ever granted the right to extract gold.

Poisonous influence

What is clear is that Global Green is controlled by Try Pheap, an infamous Cambodian tycoon who’s been sanctioned by the U.S. government and has a long track record of illegal logging, along with mining in the Mekong and in other protected forests. Pheap has long enjoyed near total impunity in Cambodia due to his close ties to senior ruling party officials.

Combined, verified government documents, satellite imagery and interviews with residents and local officials across Ta Veng district suggest that gold mining began in mid-2023, resulting in the discoloration and pollution of the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers.

One local official, who asked for anonymity for fear of speaking out against such a politically connected gold mine, recalled how armed private security denied police and government rangers access to inspect the mining site.

“Everyone knows the name, we cannot stop them,” the official said.

While an environmental impact assessment (EIA) was conducted, according to one document dated Feb. 19, 2024, the local official said the assessor — which Mongabay has since identified as E&A Consultants, a company frequently used to produce EIAs for Global Green — didn’t even visit the remote gold mining site in Virachey. E&A Consultants did not respond when Mongabay sent questions.

According to the local official, who was able to verify documents acquired by Mongabay, Global Green was only granted an exploratory license and is not permitted to extract, process or refine gold. Satellite imagery shows at least five of the alluvial mines are operating illegally outside Global Green’s concession area.

“What I’m concerned about is the natural resources in the water,” the local official said. “Mercury and acid — it’s very important that we think about this because mercury is a very bad chemical that impacts humans and wildlife. We should collect the samples in the water or wildlife that live in the area to have a laboratory [test them] to determine whether it contains these chemicals or not.”

No such tests have since been conducted, according to the official, who also questioned why the government had failed to respond to something that is so obvious to so many people across Ta Veng district.

The O’Ta Bouk is the longest river in Virachey National Park and provides a migratory link for fish species between the Sesan and Mekong rivers, but now poses a public health risk.

“If the fish are polluted with mercury, what problems could happen when humans eat them? [Global Green isn’t] following the EIA, isn’t following the law, [someone] should respond,” the local official said. “What loss will it take on the ground? What impact to the river resources? What about those living along the river, Indigenous people, who collect nontimber forest products from the area? That’s my concern.”",https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/24072528/Header-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:03:43.609127

Scotland's only oil refinery stopped processing crude oil at Grangemouth in April, after a century of operations.

The UK government has been accused of failing to deliver £200m pledged to Grangemouth from the National Wealth Fund.

The money will go towards the site's transition into a clean energy hub.

A Treasury source said: ""We said we would stand squarely behind communities like Grangemouth, and we meant it.

""And we're building on what we have done already by putting millions in as a starter to help put the community on a firm footing and strengthening its places as part of the clean energy revolution.

""These investments will help deliver a fair transition for Grangemouth, securing jobs for local people way into the future.""

Petroineos announced the refinery at the central Scotland facility would close and transition to become an import terminal after reporting massive losses.

Redundancy letters were sent out to staff at the refinery at the beginning of this year, with just 65 of 500 jobs expected to be retained.

Approximately 2,000 people were directly employed at the site - 500 at the refinery, 450 on the Forties pipeline from the North Sea and a further 1,000 in the Ineos petrochemicals business.

Project Willow

A £1.5m report into the feasibility of Grangemouth becoming a low-carbon energy hub, known as Project Willow came up with nine ideas that could be developed with private sector investment.

This included alternative uses for the site such as hydrothermal plastics recycling and anaerobic digestion.

The prime minister pledged £200m to the site at the Scottish Labour conference telling delegates it was an ""investment in Scotland's industrial future"".

In August, Unite the union said the money hadn't been delivered and workers felt abandoned.

Last November, the Scottish and UK government also signed the Falkirk and Grangemouth growth deal which promised £100m for the area through measures like a skills transition centre to get locals into work.

The UK government said work on delivering the investment continues, and this newly announced money is on top of the funds already promised.

First Minister John Swinney also announced £25m of new funding in a statement to Holyrood in February.

According to Lamberty, “the short answer is there should be little or no cost for the majority of California’s fuel terminals and retailers.”

ACE notes that E15 typically sells for 5 to 15 cents less per gallon than E10, offering direct savings for drivers. The group anticipates rapid uptake in California, driven by favourable blending economics, widespread infrastructure compatibility, and the state’s existing low-RVP base petrol.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ACE-pushes-for-quick-pic-biofuel-24-11-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 03:59:56.423299

BELEM, Brazil (Reuters) -Despite the U.S. government souring on the global climate agenda ahead of the COP30 summit, American companies did not shy away.

A Reuters analysis of attendance lists shows there were 60 representatives of Fortune 100 companies at the Brazil event, compared with 50 at last year’s in Baku, Azerbaijan. Still others attended pre-conference events in Brazil’s finance hub Sao Paulo and in Rio de Janeiro.

Tech firms including Microsoft and Google, energy company Occidental Petroleum, carmaker General Motors and lender Citigroup were among those represented on a provisional U.N. list of attendees of the official summit.

“We’ve seen no discernible change in the engagement of U.S. companies on climate policy over the course of this year. And that was certainly reflected in attendance levels,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general for policy at the International Chamber of Commerce.

“We are also seeing growing concern across industry about the growing costs of extreme weather events — underscoring the need for effective policy responses.”

Executives said they didn’t think now was a good time to opt out of the climate conversation, with rising temperatures unleashing ever more threats to factories, supply chains and the bottom line.

“We’re doing it because it’s good for the business. It helps create supply security,” said PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) Jim Andrew on the sidelines of the talks.

“We need farmers to be successful, we need them to keep farming,” he added, given the company makes the bulk of its revenues from foods including Walkers Crisps and Quaker Oats.

FILLING THE VOID

Darren Woods, the boss of top U.S. oil company ExxonMobil was among the U.S. executives, mayors and other sub-national leaders who attended the pre-COP events.

All those players have an important role in the future of climate action, according to Lou Leonard, Inaugural Dean of Clark University’s School of Climate, Environment, and Society.

Existing policies from federal and non-federal actors would lead to a 35% reduction in U.S. emissions by 2035, a recent analysis led by the Center for Global Sustainability (CGS) at the University of Maryland showed.

Much of that is being driven by companies.

“Despite the headlines, the private sector continues to invest in and deploy clean energy,” said Gina McCarthy, former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and now Managing Co-Chair of ‘America Is All In’, a coalition of non-federal leaders.

“Last year, clean energy jobs in the U.S. expanded three times faster than the rest of the nation’s workforce.”

The two-week-long COP30 conference also included many smaller U.S. companies in sectors set to profit from the world’s shift to low-carbon energy, including in carbon markets.

“Being here is about connecting globally,” said Brennan Spellacy, chief executive at carbon credits platform Patch, “Most of my meetings here are with English, French, and German sustainability leaders and CSOs.”

U.S. COMPANIES HAVE A CRUCIAL ROLE

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. But regardless of the U.S. federal position, regulations are changing across the world to hasten the energy transition even though the final deal at COP30 disappointed some.

“Irrespective of what’s coming out of the United States, in terms of rhetoric, the market is moving (and) policymakers are recognising the direction of travel,” said Jack Hurd, head of both the World Economic Forum’s Earth System Agenda and the Tropical Forest Alliance.

More U.S. companies are also disclosing their climate strategies despite the U.S. dropping plans for a federal rule requiring it, although the quality of plans from companies across the globe remains low, data from disclosure platform CDP showed.

Whether they were at the main event or not, the fact U.S. companies appeared was significant, said Maria Mendiluce, CEO at the We Mean Business Coalition.

“The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters.”

“Even when domestic politics are unsettled, the U.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways. Its engagement signals to investors that the world’s largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes of the energy transition.”

The vertically integrated facility is expected to add 3.5 GW of annual nameplate capacity once fully ramped.

The facility will increase First Solar America’s manufacturing portfolio to 14 GW in 2026. This portfolio is expected to increase to 17.7 GW in 2027, after a recently announced South Carolina facility reaches full capacity.

The South Carolina facility will be in Gaffney, with an investment of approximately $330 million. The company aims to utilize this facility to onshore the final production process for its Series 6 Plus modules.

First Solar said the Iberia Parish facility began production ahead of schedule in July 2025. It added that the accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill this year. This catalyzed demand for U.S.-made solar components that are fully compliant with the Foreign Entities of Concern guidelines.

The company said the Iberia Parish facility is not dependent on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains. Its Series 7 modules are produced using materials from the U.S., including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi, which is then fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

First Solar stated that the Iberia Parish facility is AI-enabled, using computer vision and deep learning to detect solar panel defects during production. Additionally, the technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision-making.

The company has three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio and one in Alabama. It also has research and development (R&D) centers in Ohio and California. First Solar said it will have invested roughly $4.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019. It expects its global nameplate capacity to grow to about 25 GW by 2026.

First Solar’s revenue rose 79.6% year-over-year to $1.59 billion in the third quarter (Q3) of 2025 from $887.67 million.

It delivered 5.3 GW of modules in Q3 2025. The company’s expected contracted backlog stands at 54.5 GW through 2030. It manufactured 3.6 GW of modules during the quarter, with 2.5 GW coming from its U.S. facilities and 1.1 GW from its international facilities.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Standard-Mercom-2025-06-10T184439.631.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 02:59:46.986983

After the third quarter of 2025, it is clear that the plateau or slow decline of China’s CO2 emissions that started in early 2024 continues.
Having committed to peaking emissions “before 2030”, China’s policymakers have left their specific peaking year open.
CO2 emissions estimates are based on National Bureau of Statistics default calorific values of fuels and emissions factors from China’s latest national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, for the year 2021.
For oil consumption, apparent consumption of transport fuels (diesel, petrol and jet fuel) is taken from Sinopec quarterly results, with monthly disaggregation based on production minus net exports.","One clear driver of the growth in plastics production is import substitution – replacing equivalent products imported from overseas – as well as growing exports.

China is still a net importer of primary plastics by value in 2025 so far, but only just. The value of imports fell by 8 per cent while the value of exports increased by 8 per cent in the first nine months of the year.

The five-year plan for 2021-25 targeted an increase in chemicals production to reduce the imports of key raw materials to less than 40 per cent of demand, with projects launched to meet this target coming online this year.

More recently, the government has encouraged oil refineries to shift from the production of transport fuels to chemicals, in order to adapt to falling demand for oil in transportation. It set a target for the petrochemical and chemical sector’s economic output to grow by more than 5 per cent per year in 2025-26.

The US-China tariff tit-for-tat has added further momentum to import substitution. The US has been China’s largest source of imports of polyethylene – the most widely used plastic in the world – since 2023, but China has expanded its domestic production in response to the trade spat.

Still, the change in China’s net exports of plastics cannot account for more than a fraction of the increase in output volume, however, as estimated based on reported polymer prices. This indicates that growing domestic demand is a major driver of the rapid growth in plastics production.

Packaging is the largest use of plastics in China, with the booming online retail and food delivery industry driving rapid growth.

Express parcel volumes grew 21 per cent in 2024 and 17 per cent through September 2025. The value of the single-use plastic tableware market averaged 21 per cent annual growth from 2017 to 2022 and the revenue of the online food delivery industry is projected to grow 11 per cent in 2025.

The government is taking measures to curb single-use plastics, but these would need to be intensified to fully counteract the growth rates seen in food deliveries and other drivers. The demand for high-performance materials in new manufacturing industries is also a significant driver.

Will China’s emissions peak early or rebound?

After the third quarter of 2025, it is clear that the plateau or slow decline of China’s CO2 emissions that started in early 2024 continues.

Whether emissions increased or decreased marginally in the first three quarters of the year is too close to call, given the uncertainties involved, but a drop in full-year emissions became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately 3 per cent drop in emissions year-on-year.

Still, either a small increase or decrease in the calendar year of 2025 remains possible and will be ultimately be decided by developments in the fourth quarter.

China’s emissions from fossil-fuel use are highly likely to increase this year, with the increase of coal and oil use in the chemical industry outweighing the reductions in emissions from the power, metals, building materials and transportation sectors. This will be balanced out by a fall in cement process emissions.

What is already clear is that the 2025 carbon-intensity target will be missed, as it would have required absolute emission reductions of 4 per cent or more this year, after slow progress during the earlier years of the five-year period.

This also means that the carbon-intensity target in the next 15th five-year plan for 2026-2030 would need to be more ambitious than the one that China missed during the current period, to close the shortfall to the country’s 2030 intensity target.

China targeted an 18 per cent reduction in 2021-25, but will only have achieved around 12 per cent by the end of this year. It would then need a reduction of around 22-24 per cent in the next five years to achieve its headline climate commitment for 2030, a 65 per cent carbon-intensity reduction on 2005 levels.

Whether emissions fall this year – or not – has high symbolic significance. Having committed to peaking emissions “before 2030”, China’s policymakers have left their specific peaking year open.

China’s new greenhouse gas emission target for 2035, announced by Xi in September, was set as a reduction of 7-10 per cent below an undefined “peak level”, making it clear that policymakers are still planning for – or at least leaving the door open to – a late peak, only just before 2030.

Setting this target from “peak levels” means that the timing and level of China’s emissions peak affects not only the path of its CO2 output in the next few years, but also the size of cuts needed to meet the 2035 goal – and presumably also subsequent targets thereafter.

The target of reducing emissions from “peak levels” could also create an incentive for provinces to increase emissions before the expected peak year, known as “storming the peak” in Chinese.

This incentive could be curbed by the creation of the “dual control” system for carbon intensity and total carbon emissions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party recently reiterated that this should happen during the next five-year period, but the specific timeline is an open question.

If the system is not operational from 2026, with annual carbon intensity and possibly absolute carbon emission targets allocated to provinces, then that could further allow for and incentivise emissions increases in the short term.

At the same time, China has made commitments to peak emissions before 2030, reduce coal consumption gradually during the 2026-30 period and to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by more than 65 per cent by 2030, from 2005 levels.

Meeting the last target – which China has made internationally as part of its 2030 Paris pledge – would require, in practice, that emissions in 2030 are limited at or below their 2024 level, given progress to date and expected GDP growth rates.

Realising these targets, in turn, would require clean-energy growth rates well above the minimum of 200GW of new wind and solar capacity per year, set by China’s 2035 pledge – unless the rate of energy-demand growth sees a sharp and unexpected slowdown.

Beating these minimum clean-energy growth rates would also be necessary if policymakers want to maintain the tailwind that these sectors have provided to China’s economy in recent years.

About the data

Data for the analysis was compiled from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, National Energy Administration of China, China Electricity Council and China Customs official data releases, from WIND Information, an industry data provider, and Sinopec, China’s largest oil refiner.

Wind and solar output, and thermal power breakdown by fuel, was calculated by multiplying power generating capacity at the end of each month by monthly utilisation, using data reported by China Electricity Council through Wind Financial Terminal.

Total generation from thermal power and generation from hydropower and nuclear power was taken from National Bureau of Statistics monthly releases.

Monthly utilisation data was not available for biomass, so the annual average of 52 per cent for 2023 was applied. Power sector coal consumption was estimated based on power generation from coal and the average heat rate of coal-fired power plants during each month, to avoid the issue with official coal consumption numbers affecting recent data.

CO2 emissions estimates are based on National Bureau of Statistics default calorific values of fuels and emissions factors from China’s latest national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, for the year 2021. Cement CO2 emissions factor is based on annual estimates up to 2024.

For oil consumption, apparent consumption of transport fuels (diesel, petrol and jet fuel) is taken from Sinopec quarterly results, with monthly disaggregation based on production minus net exports. The consumption of these three fuels is labeled as oil product consumption in transportation, as it is the dominant sector for their use.

Apparent consumption of other oil products is calculated from refinery throughput, with the production of the transport fuels and the net exports of other oil products subtracted. Fossil-fuel consumption includes non-energy use, as most products are short-lived and incineration is the dominant disposal method.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/billow926-Vh4uekJdCSw-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-24 04:59:03.848213

Supporters of the administration say the EPA is demonstrating that environmental protection can coexist with accelerated permitting and energy development.
Environmental advocates say the pace and focus deserve closer scrutiny, especially as major decisions around water rules, air standards, waste management, and industrial permitting continue to unfold.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released a new list of 100 actions completed in the last 100 days, bringing the agency’s public tally to 300 accomplishments since President Donald Trump took office in January. The update, announced Monday in Dallas by Administrator Lee Zeldin, highlights a blend of emergency response work, enforcement activity, and regulatory changes—but also raises questions from outside groups about how these actions align with long-term environmental protections.

EPA officials say the rapid pace reflects a focused effort to meet statutory obligations while responding to crises across the country. Critics counter that the administration’s emphasis on permitting reforms and a narrower regulatory approach may shift burdens to states, weaken oversight, or accelerate industrial projects without fully accounting for environmental impacts.

Region 6: Major Response Operations and High-Profile Permits

EPA’s Region 6—covering Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico—was at the center of several large actions, including:

Smitty’s Supply Fire Cleanup: EPA oversaw the removal of more than 11 million gallons of waste from waterways impacted by a fire in Roseland, Louisiana.

Key Energy Permits: The agency issued permits for ExxonMobil’s Class VI carbon storage wells and a Clean Air Act permit for the Texas GulfLink deepwater port project. Supporters see these decisions as essential for energy development, while environmental groups warn of potential long-term risks tied to increased industrial activity.

Los Alamos Oversight: EPA monitored the depressurization of tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, with no deviations in air monitoring detected.

Region 6 Administrator Scott Mason said the team has shown it can “fulfill our mission to protect human health and the environment while not getting in the way of economic development.” Some community and environmental organizations in the region, however, argue that permitting decisions are moving faster than public engagement processes can keep up.

Nationwide Actions: Regulatory Changes and Cleanup Work

The EPA’s list covers a wide range of actions—some routine, some controversial. Among them:

A proposed rule redefining “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), which the agency calls “clear” and “commonsense,” but which opponents say could scale back federal water protections.

Continued work on the Tijuana–San Diego sewage infrastructure, with the agency reporting accelerated project timelines following the U.S.–Mexico agreement signed in July.

Enforcement actions targeting illegal pesticides and chemical imports at the border.

Cleanup and emergency responses in wildfire zones, industrial sites, and PFAS-affected communities.

The EPA also highlighted progress on pesticide backlogs, Brownfields redevelopment, and Superfund enforcement, including cases that collectively address tens of millions of pounds of air, water, and chemical pollution.

Administrator Zeldin framed the update as evidence of an agency moving quickly.

“300 days, 300 major environmental wins—this is the energy that propels us forward,” he said.

Supporters of the administration say the EPA is demonstrating that environmental protection can coexist with accelerated permitting and energy development. Environmental groups counter that some of the gains- - particularly around enforcement and cleanup—reflect long-term, ongoing work rather than new initiatives, and that other actions, such as regulatory rollbacks, could have lasting implications for air and water quality.

Rather than listing every individual action, the EPA pointed to broader areas of progress:

Emergency response: Major deployments after fires, industrial accidents, hurricanes, and chemical releases.

Superfund and cleanup: Advancements at sites in Michigan, Idaho, Massachusetts, Kansas, New Jersey, and elsewhere.

Permitting and regulatory work: State plan approvals, air-quality revisions, infrastructure permits, and streamlined review processes.

Enforcement: Nearly 1,800 enforcement cases concluded and strengthened oversight of illegal pesticides and chemicals.

Drinking-water protections: Orders, treatments, and infrastructure assistance in states from New York to Arizona.

Many of these actions are typical of EPA’s role regardless of administration; others reflect policy priorities unique to the Trump EPA—particularly around permitting, energy projects, and state-led regulatory approaches.

The EPA says the accomplishments reflect its mission to protect human health and the environment while advancing “commonsense” policies. Environmental advocates say the pace and focus deserve closer scrutiny, especially as major decisions around water rules, air standards, waste management, and industrial permitting continue to unfold.

As the agency nears the end of its first year under Administrator Zeldin, the divide underscores a broader debate: whether the EPA is recalibrating environmental protection to be more efficient and economically flexible, or reshaping key environmental safeguards in ways that may be felt long after these 300 days.",https://www.thedriller.com/ext/resources/2025/11/23/Medals-for-EPA.png?height=635&t=1763957967&width=1200,N,,2025-11-24 04:00:10.356186

While the commitment to clean energy is commendable, a regional organization is calling on municipalities, businesses, faith-based organizations, charitable groups, and schools to take advantage of federal tax credits to undertake solar installations.

To date, five municipalities in Montgomery, Bucks, and Chester counties have installed solar panels and arrays, dramatically cutting their energy costs.

In its fourth year of solar power use, West Rockhill Township has completely offset the $16,000 annually in taxpayer expenses associated with the 84 megawatts used to power municipal operations, including local government buildings, parks, traffic infrastructure, and water wells. In addition, the 16.3-square-mile Bucks County municipality has reduced carbon emissions by 644,814 pounds, according to a 2025 presentation.

Bill Sabey, a volunteer with Community Advocates and Ready for 100 – Montgomery County, encourages municipalities to make the switch to solar power – and take advantage of federal tax credits in the process. To qualify for the 30 percent federal tax credit, entities, including nonprofits, schools, faith-based groups, and commercial businesses, must start installation by July 4, 2026, or finish by the end of 2027.

“By installing solar power systems and transitioning to clean energy, municipalities can significantly reduce carbon emissions, enhance public health by mitigating air pollution, set an example for the community, and save substantial amounts of money over time through lower energy costs,” Sabey said. “The move to solar energy is not only a financial decision, but also a public health, public safety, and environmental strategy. Moreover, it positions municipalities as leaders in sustainability, benefiting from the numerous financial, social, and environmental rewards that come with a greener energy future.”

Community Advocates volunteers work with towns to set goals of transitioning to 100 percent clean renewable electricity by 2035. To date, 45 municipalities have adopted similar clean energy resolutions, which also includes reaching clean energy for heat and transportation by 2050 community-wide and developing a plan to get there.

With solar installation incentives soon set to expire, Sabey hopes more communities get on board.

Solar saves money and reduces reliance on other power sources

Lansdale Borough Mayor Garry Herbert said in 2023 that the borough estimated saving $330,200 over 30 months – or roughly $11,000 per month – as a result of solar power.

“Solar power allows Lansdale Borough to produce its own sustainable energy, reducing reliance on external sources. This independence is crucial as it helps shield the community from the volatile natural gas market,” Herbert said. “By investing in solar panels, the borough mitigates the risks associated with unpredictable energy prices, ensuring a stable and affordable energy supply for residents.”

Doylestown Borough, earlier this year, finished a solar installation on its administration building roof and a section of its police station. The municipality received a one-time federal credit of $114,318, PECO rebates, and other solar incentives. Borough Manager John Davis said solar will save the borough more than one-third of its energy costs.

Horsham Township announced in 2023 that the governing body had approved a solar project that would equip key buildings, including the municipal building, police station, community center, and public works building, with solar panels.

“Solar energy is a clean and renewable resource that will lower the township’s energy costs and help mitigate the environmental impacts associated with traditional energy sources,” according to Horsham’s 2023 State of Horsham report.

Extra solar power pays

Earlier this year, West Goshen Township Board of Supervisors Chairman Shaun Walsh said that the solar array installation on the public works building is expected to generate 312,000 kWh of electricity in its first year.

“This quantity exceeds the annual amount of power consumed by the Public Works building, hence the net metering requirement for this account,” Walsh wrote. “Meaning … we get paid for exporting power to the grid anytime our electricity generation is greater than our usage!”

The array consists of 468 panels. The project cost $537,000, with total projected cost savings of $1,375,000 based on a 30-year expected life for the solar panels The project has a 10-year simple payback. The project is eligible for a federal rebate of 30 percent of the cost.

MU CITY is now firmly positioned as a regional gateway for clean energy, green manufacturing, advanced e-mobility, and data-driven intelligence — supporting Indonesia's national roadmap for renewable energy and digital transformation. The MU CITY development represents an estimated USD 2.3 billion investment over the next three years, making it the largest single investment in Karimun to date.

A Dynamic City for the New Energy Era

Spanning 4,000 hectares, MU CITY will be powered by up to 2 gigawatts (GW) of solar power and an additional 2 GW of gas-based power, making it one of Southeast Asia's largest integrated sustainable energy ecosystems. A major portion of this capacity will power the local industrial zones, data campuses, and mobility manufacturing clusters within MU CITY, while the remainder will be allocated for clean energy exports to ASEAN nations — reinforcing Indonesia's role as a regional energy provider.

MU CITY will integrate three complementary development zones:

Clean Energy Hub – Anchored by large-scale solar power plants, advanced battery energy storage systems (BESS), LNG import facilities, CCGTs and blue ammonia tank complexes to support domestic decarbonization and regional export markets. This hub will serve as MU CITY's energy backbone.

Mobility & Manufacturing Hub – Dedicated to clean transportation innovation through electric vehicle assembly, battery manufacturing, AI chip ecosystems, and green industrial production aligned with Indonesia's vision for electric mobility and advanced manufacturing.

AI & Digital Infrastructure Hub – Powering up to 1.21 GW of hyperscale data center capacity, purpose-built for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and high-performance digital workloads — all powered by renewable energy generated within MU CITY.

Together, these interconnected hubs will position MU CITY as a leading force in clean innovation and digital transformation, redefining how energy, technology, and mobility harmonize with people and the planet.

Empowering Local Communities Through Partnership

Through close collaboration with the Karimun Regency Government, Aslan is implementing a cooperative and inclusive development model in which over 10,000 local residents actively participate and benefit from the project's growth. This model offers opportunities for profit-sharing, equity participation, education programs, and technical training — ensuring that communities are true stakeholders in progress.

Instead of accelerating, global climate action is losing steam.
Instead of sticking with existing targets, Connecticut could recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities.
Counterintuitive as it may seem, easing off aggressive climate targets could enable faster emissions reductions.","Connecticut residents rank among the strongest supporters of climate policy in the country. In 2022, Gov. Ned Lamont was reelected by a wide margin shortly after he and the legislature committed the state to a bold decarbonization pathway.

The science behind climate risks is stronger than ever, and there’s little reason to believe concern in Connecticut has waned. But the world around us has changed dramatically: our climate strategy was designed when there was strong momentum for global decarbonization that has since stalled. Because Connecticut’s efforts only matter in the context of a global response, we must ask whether our strategy fits today’s realities.

A few years ago, optimism for global climate progress was high. President Joe Biden committed the country to ambitious targets, and Congress passed landmark legislation—most notably the Inflation Reduction Act— pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy. Other major economies were pushing forward as well: China stunned the world with its net-zero pledge, and the European Green Deal promised the first carbon-neutral continent.

Connecticut followed suit with a bold climate law of its own, including a mandate for 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2040. At the time, we were doing our “fair share” as part of a global coalition committed to climate leadership.

Today, that context looks different. Under President Trump, the U.S. is retreating from domestic decarbonization and actively undermining global efforts —including sabotaging an international pact on shipping emissions. In Europe, the war in Ukraine has shifted focus to energy security and affordability. China’s latest climate pledge merely codifies its business-as-usual trajectory. Instead of accelerating, global climate action is losing steam.

Connecticut faces its own headwinds. In 2021, regulators envisioned offshore wind supplying roughly half of the state’s electricity by 2040. Today, the offshore wind industry is struggling due to rising costs and the loss of federal support. More broadly, clean energy projects will be costlier for ratepayers due to the pullback of federal subsidies.

This doesn’t mean we should abandon our climate goals. But we should rethink our strategy. How should a small state like Connecticut, that is committed to climate progress, navigate a world that’s not moving in the same direction?

One option is to stay the course and strive to be a model. We teach our children to keep promises even when others don’t —shouldn’t we do the same? A small state can have global influence by becoming a success story that others can replicate.

Major changes would be needed to get there. Replacing the 60% of Connecticut’s electricity that comes from natural gas will require massive investments— not just in renewables and batteries but also in 24/7 generation like nuclear power. That would come with a steep price tag. Those costs may be worthwhile given the climate, health, and community benefits of clean energy.

However, few will look to Connecticut as a model if we simply stack large costs on top of an already expensive system. Our electricity rates are among the highest in the country, and nearly double those in Pennsylvania. Leading by example would require cutting costs while cutting emissions.

I’ve authored a study that highlights some opportunities, including streamlining the permitting and interconnection processes for critical clean energy infrastructure; reducing the overlap between our cap-and-trade program, renewable portfolio standard, and state-led procurements; and completing the transition to performance-based regulation, aligning the incentives of utilities with our affordability and decarbonization goals.

Instead of sticking with existing targets, Connecticut could recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities. More gradual decarbonization could enable the state to postpone major investments —such as in offshore wind or new nuclear plants— until the costs of these technologies fall. We could reevaluate expensive rooftop solar subsidies, which pay about three times as much per kilowatt-hour as grid-scale solar. And we could consider investments in natural gas infrastructure —additional pipeline capacity could help relieve bottlenecks that drive up costs and emissions each winter.

Counterintuitive as it may seem, easing off aggressive climate targets could enable faster emissions reductions. More affordable energy helps to sustain support for climate policies and encourages more households to switch to electric cars and appliances.

Reasonable people will disagree on which of these two paths —or others— best reflects Connecticut’s values and constraints. The worst option is to press forward blindly until we hit a breaking point: ambitious targets, no credible way to meet them, and public frustration over rising energy bills.

Energy prices will be a key issue in next year’s governor’s election, just as they were in New Jersey this year. Connecticut needs an honest debate, and fresh thinking, to shape a strategy fit for today, not 2022.

By Max Oechsner

The current American administration has been canceling climate change initiatives since its first day in office.[1] The administration has abandoned lawsuits,[2] heavily deregulated,[3] and issued executive orders that repeal environmental initiatives.[4] Most recently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a rule[5] that would eliminate the 2009 endangerment finding by the EPA.[6] This finding determined that certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions hurt human health and the environment. [7] The endangerment finding is the only legal basis for the federal government to regulate GHG emissions.[8] This makes it a fairly special piece of regulation. If the endangerment finding goes away, potentially all emission regulations carried out since 2009 could go with it.[9]

Lee Zeldin, the current administrator of the EPA, has defended this proposal to the media vigorously. In one interview, Zeldin bashed the economic costs of EPA regulations as having been “significant.”[10] In another interview, Zeldin claimed that EPA regulations “were seeking, in some respects, to strangulate out of existence entire sectors of our economy.”[11] He claimed that he inherited a “mess,” which has contributed to the high costs of heating homes.[12] But how true is this rhetoric that he presents to the public in support of the EPA’s proposal?

First, we may look to the EPA proposal’s own Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).[13] In the RIA, one major consideration is the change in assumptions related to consumer interests in purchasing electric vehicles.[14] Specifically, they discuss how recent uncertainty in the continuation of tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act has reduced projected demand for EVs.[15] The uncertainty comes from Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” but these projections raise concerns that current initiatives are underperforming. However, this consideration does not go so far as to include evidence of economic strangulation.

Another consideration in the RIA is the EPA’s estimate of future gasoline and diesel prices.[16] They conclude that rollback would cause the price of gasoline to be $1 lower compared to Biden-era projections.[17] This projection, however, is not supported by data.[18] The RIA only references President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” policies.[19] And still, this consideration does not imply the strangulation of any sectors of the economy. To quote Kathy Harris, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council: “It’s a lot of funny math.”[20]

What about the past fourteen years since the endangerment finding? Has there been a noticeable strangulation of any sector of the economy that the endangerment finding regulates? Gas prices, despite being highly volatile, have not shown much increase or decrease in price since 2009.[21] U.S. field production of crude oil has actually gone up.[22] The automotive industry has seen significant growth, increasing by roughly 20 million jobs.[23] On the clean energy front, automakers have invested nearly $200 billion in U.S. clean vehicle production, supporting almost 195,000 jobs.[24] Clean energy itself has increased, with wind and solar production now providing more electricity than coal.[25] In fact, it appears that the more stable regulatory environment has been compatible with growth, innovation, and clean solutions.[26]

The inverse may also be true: a less stable regulatory environment could lead to worse economic conditions. As previously mentioned, rescinding the endangerment finding will result in important climate change regulations being repealed.[27] This could theoretically lead to patchwork state and local regulations in the absence of federal rules. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have already adopted GHG emission targets.[28] It is not difficult to imagine that these states may increase those targets while others do nothing. This would likely negatively affect industry, as shown by some automakers recently signing on to self-regulate to avoid regulatory uncertainty.[29]

Ultimately, the endangerment finding being repealed will be harmful on many levels. Our economy will likely do worse overall, with the clean energy market being hit especially hard.[30] The clean energy market’s pain, in turn, hurts our environment and our communities. Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities bear a particularly disproportionate cost from the use of fossil fuels.[31] Without emission limitations, fossil fuel pollution will continue to hurt those communities, deepening existing health disparities.[32] This is especially true considering EPA regulations are the only real option for abating harm, given the significant hurdles to bringing private suits.[33] As a result, those who could benefit most from clean energy investments—through job creation, affordable energy access, and cleaner air—are left behind.

The natural gas pipeline sector is experiencing its most significant transformation since the initial unconventional resource development began in 2008. Current infrastructure utilisation patterns reveal a system operating at capacity constraints, with flow management becoming increasingly complex as production outpaces transportation capabilities. Emergency protocols activate when demand spikes exceed available capacity, forcing operators to implement costly mitigation strategies including controlled flaring and negative pricing mechanisms.

Recent analysis indicates the U.S. Gulf Coast region faces a fundamental infrastructure challenge. Twelve major pipeline projects scheduled for completion represent the most substantial single-year capacity expansion in over fifteen years, delivering a 13% increase in regional transportation capability. This expansion addresses critical bottlenecks where production centres cannot efficiently deliver gas to consumption hubs.

Furthermore, the Permian Gas Wave Sparks Biggest Pipeline Buildout represents a paradigm shift in American energy infrastructure development. This unprecedented expansion responds to growing US economic outlook and industrial demand patterns.

Infrastructure Capacity Analysis

Pipeline utilisation data reveals systematic stress across the network. The Waha gas hub in West Texas has recorded negative pricing events as producers pay to dispose of excess gas when transportation options become unavailable. These pricing inversions signal severe infrastructure constraints rather than demand weakness.

Industry analysis confirms that $50 billion in committed pipeline investments will add 8,800 miles of new infrastructure. This represents a fundamental shift from previous expansion cycles, where producer-led development connected low-cost resources to existing markets. Current buildout responds to demand-pull dynamics from industrial consumers, export facilities, and power generation requirements.

TC Energy projections indicate North American natural gas demand will increase by 45 billion cubic feet per day by 2035. This forecast incorporates tripling LNG export capacity and unprecedented electricity demand from data processing facilities and manufacturing reshoring initiatives.

Advanced Pipeline Engineering Solutions Transform Transportation Networks

Modern pipeline development incorporates sophisticated flow optimisation technologies that adapt to volatile production patterns characteristic of unconventional resources. Unlike traditional fixed-capacity systems, new infrastructure features modular designs enabling real-time capacity adjustments without efficiency penalties.

Smart flow management systems integrate predictive analytics with automated pressure control across thousands of miles of pipeline networks. These systems process real-time data from production facilities, compression stations, and delivery points to optimise throughput while maintaining operational safety margins. In addition, data-driven operations enhance decision-making processes across the industry.

Modular Infrastructure Design

Contemporary compression stations utilise variable-speed electric drives allowing output modulation between 40-60% of maximum capacity. This flexibility accommodates the rapid production decline curves typical of unconventional wells while maintaining system efficiency during off-peak periods.

Variable frequency drives enable real-time motor speed adjustment

Predictive maintenance systems monitor equipment condition continuously

Remote monitoring capabilities reduce operational costs

Modular expansion allows capacity scaling without system redesign

Advanced compression technologies achieve efficiency ratings between 88-96% depending on drive configuration. Electric variable frequency drive systems demonstrate superior performance metrics with 8,760-hour maintenance intervals and full automation capabilities.

Engineering Project Examples

The ExxonMobil acquisition of a 40% stake in Enterprise Products Partners' Bahia natural gas liquids pipeline demonstrates industry commitment to integrated transportation solutions. This Cowboy Connector Pipeline project connects Permian production directly to Gulf Coast refining and chemical facilities while enabling export market access.

Pipeline engineering now incorporates bi-directional flow capabilities, allowing seasonal demand optimisation and emergency rerouting during maintenance periods. These systems feature automated switching mechanisms and quality monitoring stations positioned at strategic intervals throughout the network.

Specialised Infrastructure Requirements for Industrial and Export Applications

Data processing facilities require ultra-reliable gas supply with strict pressure stability parameters. These installations consume gas at steady baseload rates typically ranging from 0.8-1.2 million British thermal units per megawatt, creating predictable demand patterns that enable pipeline optimisation.

Technical specifications for data centre supply include pressure variations limited to ±2%, supply reliability exceeding 99.95% uptime, and response times under 15 minutes for demand changes. Backup capacity requirements typically specify 150% of peak demand to ensure uninterrupted operations.

LNG Terminal Engineering Complexities

Liquefied natural gas facilities present unique infrastructure challenges due to massive scale and precise operational requirements. Single processing trains typically require 0.5-0.7 billion cubic feet per day of feedgas with strict quality specifications for heating value, moisture content, and contaminant levels.

LNG terminal specifications demand feedgas quality between 1,050-1,150 British thermal units per standard cubic foot heating value, moisture content below 7 pounds per million standard cubic feet, and hydrogen sulfide limits under 4 parts per million. Processing capacity can reach 4.2 billion cubic feet per day per facility.

However, the LNG market implications extend beyond infrastructure requirements to global supply chain dynamics.

Facility Type Gas Consumption Reliability Requirement Quality Specifications Data Centres 0.8-1.2 MMBtu/MW 99.95% uptime Standard pipeline quality LNG Terminals 0.5-0.7 Bcf/d per train 99.5% availability 1,050-1,150 Btu/scf Chemical Plants Variable demand 98% reliability Process-specific

U.S. LNG exports continue reaching record levels with additional export facilities expected to commence operations before decade end. This expansion drives demand for dedicated high-capacity feedgas pipelines connecting production areas to coastal processing facilities.

Variable Production Patterns Drive Compression Technology Evolution

Unconventional gas production exhibits significant volatility requiring adaptive compression strategies. Modern compression stations integrate variable-speed electric drives enabling real-time output adjustment without mechanical modifications or efficiency degradation.

Variable frequency drive technology adjusts voltage and frequency supplied to AC motors, allowing precise output modulation. These systems can modify compression capacity by 40-60% while maintaining optimal efficiency ratings throughout the operating range.

Advanced Compression System Performance

Technology Configuration Efficiency Range Maintenance Interval Automation Level Electric VFD Systems 92-96% 8,760 hours Full automation Gas Turbine Drives 88-92% 6,000 hours Semi-automated Reciprocating Units 90-94% 4,380 hours Manual override

Predictive maintenance systems utilise vibration analysis, thermal monitoring, and performance trending to identify potential equipment issues before failure occurs. These systems can reduce unplanned downtime by 35-40% while improving overall system efficiency by 8-12%.

Remote operation capabilities enable centralised monitoring and control of multiple compression facilities from single control centres. Automated shutdown systems activate within seconds when operational parameters exceed safe thresholds, preventing equipment damage and environmental releases.

Multi-Commodity Pipeline Systems Present Complex Engineering Challenges

Integrated pipeline systems transport both raw natural gas and extracted natural gas liquids simultaneously, maximising infrastructure utilisation while reducing capital requirements. These systems incorporate sophisticated separation and processing capabilities enabling real-time product optimisation during transport.

Inline fractionation units enable ethane and propane separation during pipeline transport, eliminating the need for separate processing facilities. Quality monitoring stations positioned every 50-100 miles ensure product specifications remain within required parameters throughout the transportation process.

Processing Technology Integration

Modern pipeline systems integrate field processing equipment directly into transportation infrastructure, enabling continuous gas conditioning and natural gas liquid extraction. This approach reduces overall project costs while maintaining strict product quality standards.

Dedicated NGL pipeline networks utilise 8-16 inch diameter systems

Automated switching systems enable product routing optimisation

Integrated vapour recovery units minimise emissions

Real-time quality analysis ensures specification compliance

Multi-commodity systems require specialised engineering to handle different product characteristics, flow rates, and quality requirements. Pipeline materials must accommodate varying pressures, temperatures, and chemical compositions while maintaining long-term operational reliability.

Regulatory Engineering Standards Shape Modern Pipeline Design

Pipeline engineering must incorporate comprehensive safety and environmental protection systems significantly impacting design complexity and capital costs. These systems include automated leak detection, emergency shutdown capabilities, and continuous environmental monitoring.

Mandatory safety engineering features require computational pipeline monitoring systems, automated valve closure mechanisms responding within 30 seconds, cathodic protection for corrosion prevention, and seismic monitoring with automatic shutdown triggers.

Emissions Control Integration

Advanced emissions reduction technologies include vapour recovery units, low-emission pneumatic devices, and methane detection systems. These technologies typically add 12-18% to capital costs but ensure regulatory compliance and operational sustainability.

Safety engineering standards mandate multiple redundant systems including emergency block valves, pressure relief systems, and fire suppression equipment. Pipeline routes must avoid sensitive environmental areas while incorporating wildlife crossing structures and habitat protection measures.

Regulatory approval processes require comprehensive environmental impact assessments, stakeholder consultation programs, and long-term monitoring commitments. Projects must demonstrate compliance with federal, state, and local regulations throughout their operational lifecycle.

Investment Models Drive Strategic Pipeline Development Decisions

Pipeline developers utilise sophisticated economic models incorporating multiple revenue streams including transportation fees, processing margins, and capacity optimisation services. These models account for 20-30 year operational periods with varying demand scenarios and regulatory changes.

Investment decision metrics target internal rates of return between 12-15% minimum, net present values ranging $2-4 billion for major projects, payback periods of 8-12 years, and capacity utilisation breakeven points at 65-70%.

For instance, the Permian Gas Wave Sparks Biggest Pipeline Buildout reflects strategic investment alignment with market fundamentals. The US natural gas forecast supports this infrastructure expansion through projected demand growth.

Revenue Optimisation Strategies

Contemporary pipeline operators implement dynamic pricing models, seasonal capacity auctions, and interruptible service contracts to maximise revenue while maintaining system reliability. These strategies can increase revenue by 15-25% compared to traditional fixed-rate approaches.

Firm transportation contracts provide guaranteed revenue streams

Interruptible services offer premium pricing during high-demand periods

Processing services generate additional margin opportunities

Storage integration provides seasonal optimisation benefits

Capital allocation frameworks evaluate projects based on strategic importance, risk profiles, and synergistic opportunities with existing infrastructure. Developers prioritise projects serving multiple markets and customer segments to enhance long-term viability.

Artificial Intelligence Transforms Pipeline Operational Efficiency

AI systems analyse real-time data from thousands of sensors throughout pipeline networks to optimise gas flow, predict maintenance requirements, and prevent operational disruptions. These systems improve overall efficiency by 8-12% while reducing unplanned downtime by 35-40%.

Machine learning algorithms process historical production data, weather patterns, and demand forecasts to continuously optimise pipeline operations. These systems learn from operational patterns to improve performance and predict future requirements.

Predictive Analytics Applications

Advanced analytics enable predictive maintenance scheduling, real-time flow optimisation, automated leak detection and response, and demand forecasting with capacity planning integration. AI systems can identify potential issues days or weeks before traditional monitoring methods.

Pattern recognition identifies equipment degradation trends

Automated optimisation adjusts flows across multiple pipeline segments

Predictive models forecast maintenance requirements

Real-time analytics enable rapid response to operational changes

Furthermore, AI transformation insights demonstrate similar technological applications across energy sectors. Digital twin technology creates virtual pipeline models enabling scenario testing and optimisation without operational risks.

Long-Term Infrastructure Sustainability and Future-Proofing Strategies

Pipeline engineers design systems with flexibility to handle evolving gas compositions including higher hydrogen content and renewable gas blends. This future-proofing requires upgraded materials, modified compression systems, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

Sustainability engineering features incorporate hydrogen-compatible steel specifications, renewable gas blending capabilities, carbon capture integration points, and electrification-ready compression stations. These modifications ensure infrastructure remains viable as energy systems transition.

Lifecycle Management Approaches

Comprehensive lifecycle management strategies include planned capacity expansions, technology upgrade pathways, and end-of-life transition planning. These approaches ensure 40-50 year operational viability while maintaining environmental compliance and economic performance.

Modular design enables incremental capacity additions

Technology platforms support equipment upgrades

Materials selection considers long-term compatibility

Environmental monitoring ensures regulatory compliance

Infrastructure developers increasingly focus on adaptability and resilience rather than simply meeting current requirements. Projects must accommodate changing energy markets, evolving regulations, and emerging technologies throughout their operational lifespans.

Consequently, the Permian Gas Wave Sparks Biggest Pipeline Buildout represents more than immediate capacity expansion—it establishes foundation infrastructure for decades of energy market evolution. Analysis from Natural Gas Intel confirms this strategic positioning addresses both current constraints and future opportunities.

""This pipeline buildout reflects fundamental shifts in American energy infrastructure, positioning the sector for sustained growth across multiple demand segments while maintaining operational excellence and environmental stewardship.""

The Gender Action Plan (GAP) is a key component of the Enhanced Lima Work Programme on Gender (LWPG), which aims to integrate gender equality into all aspects of climate policy and action. The GAP provides clear guidance for countries to implement gender-responsive climate policies and actions – policies that recognize that climate impacts are not gender-neutral and that women, girls, and gender-expansive people are disproportionately affected. The LWPG was established in 2014 and has undergone several reviews and extensions, with the most recent decision stretching its mandate for 10 more years. The new iteration of the GAP was developed at the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SB62) in June 2025, with a draft decision now up for consideration and, hopefully, adoption here at COP30. These workstreams on gender intersect with the other major tracks – Adaptation, Mitigation, and Loss and Damage – because gender justice is not an ancillary concern but a thread woven through the whole climate tapestry.

Within the negotiations, I caucus with the Women and Gender Constituency (WGC), which has put forward a comprehensive and compelling set of recommendations for the GAP. The WGC’s demands aim to drive measurable, gender-transformative action and secure the resources necessary for implementation. These proposals come directly from communities experiencing multiple, layered impacts: women defending land rights, Indigenous women safeguarding forests, girls denied education due to climate-driven displacement, and gender-diverse people whose livelihoods and safety are threatened by climate instability. The WGC Demands for COP30 – well worth reading in full – are grounded in lived experience and proven community-based solutions.

And yet, these community-based solutions are under attack on several fronts, notably by theocracies like Saudi Arabia and the Holy See.

For me, as a faith-based advocate in international problem-solving spaces, theocracy presents a peculiar problem.

Every government is subject to hardline positions and orthodoxies. Democracies, monarchies, republics, parliaments – all have the capacity to assert their ethical boundaries in ways that would shock the conscious elsewhere. But theocracies add a new layer to that problem: They attribute those assertions to God. They project their political choices as divine will, wrapping policy positions in sacred language in ways that attempt to shield them from scrutiny in ways that are neither accountable nor correctable through the usual diplomatic tools.

The existence of true theocracies sometimes makes me defensive about the nature of the work I do. I speak as a person of faith and as a member of a church; I advocate in the name of teachings that shape my moral imagination. And yet I am firmly convinced – convicted, even – that governments function best when they are separate from the church. I come to the UNFCCC space representing a faith-based organization but not as someone attempting to legislate scripture or impose doctrine. Instead, my grounding is in a tradition that commands us to protect the vulnerable, tend creation, and ensure the flourishing of all people.

In international spaces, I caucus with religious leaders from across the world – people with sincerely held beliefs based on religious laws and doctrines that affirm, for example, that the planet ought to be protected, vulnerable communities deserve to be shielded, and human flourishing is the will of the divine. These leaders and advocates bring moral clarity, historical wisdom, and spiritual courage to the negotiations, calling for justice where politics alone has failed.

However, when people professing those same beliefs act in the name of governments or nation-states and use religious vocabulary to derail needed action, the dynamic shifts. When “religious freedom” becomes the justification for blocking inclusive language, stopping gender-responsive financing, or undermining human rights protections, it muddies the waters I have to swim in. It forces those of us who speak from a place of faith to clarify – over and over again – that our advocacy does not align with theocratic control, that our moral imperatives do not require the silencing of others, and that our sacred texts do not excuse injustice.

The paradox is stark: The climate crisis requires moral courage and spiritual imagination. Yet some of the loudest religious voices in this process deploy theology not to advance justice but to obstruct it. And in doing so, they make the work of faith-rooted advocates even more necessary.

Faith is not the problem. Theocracy might be. And here at COP30, that distinction matters more than ever.

The Permian Express pipeline system is owned by Permian Express Partners LLC, an 85/15 joint venture of Sunoco Logistics Partners and ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. that was formed in 2016.
Then in 2017, Sunoco Logistics turned around and acquired its former parent, Energy Transfer Partners.
The two companies merged and then took on the Energy Transfer name and combined their pipeline systems into a single network.
Today, Energy Transfer owns 85% of Permian Express, while ExxonMobil retains its 15% stake under the original joint operating agreement.","Energy Transfer stitched together its Permian Express system in stages over multiple years — first reversing and repurposing existing crude oil pipes, then building new capacity — and it’s now a standout in the company’s midstream portfolio, able to carry 600 Mb/d of crude oil from the Permian Basin to Nederland, TX, with multiple receipt and delivery points. In today’s RBN blog, we’ll look at the Permian Express system and how it fits into Energy Transfer’s broader midstream strategy.

This is the latest in our series on crude oil pipelines exiting the Permian Basin. In Bustin’ Out, we discussed the EPIC Crude Pipeline, which has been operating at full capacity. Then, we told the story of Gray Oak Pipeline in Movin' On Up and the Cactus I and II pipelines in Can’t Hold Back. All four travel to Corpus Christi. We recently wrapped up our Permian-to-Houston series with a new Drill Down Report, West Texas Highway, where we detailed how Houston is competing head-to-head with the Corpus Christi area to attract Permian barrels.

There are only two pipelines that make the long trip from the Permian to Nederland, both owned by Energy Transfer: West Texas Gulf, the subject of our most recent blog on the subject, and Permian Express, which we’ll discuss today. These two lines boast a combined capacity of nearly 1 MMb/d to Nederland, a small city about 10 miles southeast of Beaumont. Beaumont and Nederland are in an industrial corridor in southeast Texas known as the Golden Triangle and are often referred to as a single market.

Nederland receives considerably less Permian crude than Corpus Christi and Houston because its primary role is feeding nearby refineries in Port Arthur and Beaumont, including facilities owned by ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies. In contrast, Houston and Corpus Christi are export-driven hubs that together handle about 75% of Permian output. Through mid-year 2025, roughly 2.45 MMb/d of Permian crude flowed to Corpus Christi and 2.44 MMb/d headed to Houston, according to RBN’s Crude Oil Permian report, with only about 860 Mb/d destined for Nederland.

Early flows to Nederland primarily supplied refinery demand, but after the ban on most U.S. crude exports was lifted in 2015, volumes also began supporting export movements. In October, crude export loadings in the Beaumont/Nederland area averaged about 230-250 Mb/d, while Houston consistently exports more than 1 MMb/d and Corpus Christi pushes above 2 MMb/d, according to RBN’s Crude Voyager. While crude export volumes from Nederland are far smaller than those from Houston or Corpus Christi, Permian Express’s connectivity is vital to Energy Transfer’s strategy (more on that below).

The Permian Express pipeline system is owned by Permian Express Partners LLC, an 85/15 joint venture of Sunoco Logistics Partners and ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. that was formed in 2016. As for the ownership of Sunoco Logistics Partners, that’s a little complicated. In 2012, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) bought Sunoco Inc., which was the parent company of Sunoco Logistics. After the purchase, Sunoco Logistics continued to operate separately under its own name. Then in 2017, Sunoco Logistics turned around and acquired its former parent, Energy Transfer Partners. The two companies merged and then took on the Energy Transfer name and combined their pipeline systems into a single network. Today, Energy Transfer owns 85% of Permian Express, while ExxonMobil retains its 15% stake under the original joint operating agreement.",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2025-11/Figure%201.%20Energy%20Transfer%27s%20Permian-to-Gulf%20Connectivity.%20Source%20RBN.png?itok=YQ2zTEvo,N,,2025-11-23 23:59:27.723839

Electric vehicle sales grew from just 0.5 million (1% of total car sales) in 2015 to over 17 million (20%) in 2024. In China, EVs now account for almost half of all new car sales.

Global clean energy investments exceeded $2 trillion for the first time in 2024, more than double the value invested in fossil fuels.

Renewable sector jobs reached 16.2 million (out of 34.8 million total clean energy jobs), with solar at the forefront of global employment growth.

Opportunities for a Just and Inclusive Energy Transition

The report stresses that renewables can unlock vast social and economic benefits beyond emissions reductions. Investment in clean technologies boosts job creation and GDP—clean energy accounted for 10% of China’s GDP in 2024 and drove nearly one-third of European Union economic growth. The transition supports millions of new green jobs, improves air quality, and strengthens public health. Access to clean energy—especially in developing countries—remains an urgent priority, with solar mini-grids identified as the most effective solution for rural electrification.

Systematic adoption of renewables and energy efficiency leads to:

6.4% higher GDP, 3.5% more jobs, and 25% higher social welfare across Africa by 2050 (IRENA report).

3.4% higher GDP and 10% higher social welfare in Southeast Asia.

Atlantic Renewables is committed to delivering inclusive solar solutions—reach out for community projects or educational solar initiatives.

Persistent Barriers to Achieving Net Zero

Despite rapid progress, global fossil fuel use remains stubbornly high—dropping only modestly from 83% to 80% of primary energy supply over the last decade. Clean energy financing is a major bottleneck, especially in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Less than one in five dollars of global clean energy investment flows to EMDEs outside China. Africa, with 20% of the world's population and 85% of the population lacking electricity access, receives just 2% of global renewables.

Other vital challenges include:

High upfront capital costs and weak enabling policy frameworks.

Grid bottlenecks, with 3,000 GW of renewable projects awaiting connection.

Political resistance and lobbying by fossil fuel interests.

Continued public subsidies for fossil fuel use, which dwarf investment in climate-friendly solutions.

Supply chain vulnerabilities—with 88% of global solar manufacturing capacity in China, and critical minerals supply dominated by a handful of countries.

The UN calls for annual clean energy spending in developing countries to reach $1.4-1.9 trillion by 2030, a five-to-sevenfold increase from current levels, to meet Paris Agreement and SDG goals. Massive public-private mobilisation and international cooperation will be crucial.

Six Priority Actions for Policymakers

Outlined in the report, priority actions include:

Policy coherence, clarity, and certainty, with just transition roadmaps.

Investment in enabling infrastructure—grids, storage, and smart technologies.

Meeting new electricity demand with renewables, particularly for Big Tech and data centres.

Placing people and equity at the heart of the transition, ensuring universal energy access and social protection for affected workers.

Supercharging trade and investment cooperation, lowering tariffs on clean technologies and reforming treaties.

Dismantling structural barriers to finance—mobilising upgrades in global financial architecture, increasing concessional finance, and building local capacity.

For government white papers and new national energy strategies, review the UN Moment of Opportunity report.

Implications for the UK and Atlantic Renewables Clients

UK energy prices have demonstrated the value of renewables—households could have paid double absent solar and wind deployment in 2022. The push for decarbonisation, energy security, and cost savings mirrors the opportunities outlined for wider Europe and the world. Local investment in solar PV, battery storage, and smart grid infrastructure is essential for resilience, cost control, and job creation. As the UN report demonstrates, acting now delivers not only climate but economic and social wins.

It’s a fair question. This year saw an abrupt end to tax credits for electric cars, renewable energy projects, and home energy efficiency improvements. The U.S. Department of Energy canceled nearly $6 billion in grant funding for clean energy projects , including $550 million slated for projects in Colorado . For the second time, the United States is backing out of the climate goals established in the Paris Agreement , and fossil fuel interests are being given priority over endangered species and critical wildlife habitat . Meanwhile, climate change continues to make heatwaves more common , wildfires worse and hurricanes more intense . And holiday travelers be warned — air turbulence is becoming more frequent , too.

It sure feels like national environmental policy is having a Sisyphus moment . So, is there any reason to be hopeful? Yes, there is. Certainly, the challenges are real. But not all the news is bad. In this season of Thanksgiving, let’s remind ourselves of some good news.

A 100% clean energy future is possible

When you think about the kind of world you want to live in, is it a world full of power plants that spew air pollutants toxic to both humans and the environment? While fossil fuels like coal have historically kept our lights on, they’ve done so at a cost. There are well-established links between mining , refining , and burning fossil fuels and negative human health outcomes, like asthma, heart attack, cancer, and premature death.

Instead, what if we prioritized affordable, abundant energy systems as well as healthy humans and thriving ecosystems? That vision is possible. Not in the future, not with yet-to-be-discovered technology — it’s possible now.

In fact, it’s already happening. In 2019, 20% of the U.S. electric grid was powered by renewable sources . Electricity in Summit County is over 40% renewable and on track to be over 80% renewable by 2030 . Research out of Stanford University shows that the entire U.S. electric grid can be fully powered by wind, water, solar and battery storage while maintaining grid stability. Moreover, it can be done more cheaply, more efficiently, and with greater job creation than the business-as-usual scenario (which includes fossil-fuel generated electricity). When factoring in the savings from fewer premature deaths and illnesses caused by air pollution, as well as avoided costs from climate change-related damage to infrastructure, agriculture, etc ., the payback period for this transition is less than 10 years.

Global emissions are flattening

A recent analysis from the U.S. research firm Rhodium Group found that international cooperation to decrease greenhouse gas emissions is working . Climate change is still a very pressing challenge, but the scale of renewable energy and electric vehicle deployment across the globe is beginning to flatten emissions. This doesn’t mean that we’ve solved the climate crisis . Indeed, the likelihood of meeting the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement is less than 5% .

Nevertheless, new reporting from the United Nations indicates that, because of the commitments countries made under the Paris Agreement, expected temperature increases by the end of the century are lower than they were 10 years ago. And Rhodium Group’s data shows that strong policy support, investment, and thoughtful regulatory reform can accelerate progress both at home and abroad. Need proof that rapid decarbonization is possible? Uruguay did it in less than 10 years .

From good news to active hope

Less than 10 years to decarbonize a grid, and less than 10 years to pay off the investment. That’s enough to give me hope for the future. But that doesn’t mean sitting idly by waiting for that future to come. What we need is active hope.

Active hope means taking concrete action to ensure the renewable energy future arrives sooner rather than later . It means advocating for smart policy and regulations, submitting comments to our elected officials, and even the Colorado Public Utilities Commission . It also means participating in the clean energy transition as we’re able. In these Sisyphean moments when I feel like the rock is slipping away yet again, it is this active hope that grounds me and keeps me going. And for that, I am grateful.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2025/04/17162433/as17-148-22727_lrg_0.jpg.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 21:58:00.128910

Trump’s evident disdain for the renewable energy sector has set the standard for new oil and gas investments","The world has been attempting to foster cooperation in the energy sector, and the United States has one of the largest energy industries on Earth. US President Donald Trump recently visited several Asian nations, including Japan, on a tour of the region, stopping off in China for a high-level tariff meeting with President XI, before heading off to several other nations, where he was praised and given the kind of adoration that he so obviously craves. In his trip to Japan, the Japanese government agreed to invest up to $550 billion in the US’s energy and LNG infrastructure.

The US and Japan have agreed on a framework for the astonishing investments in US energy

During his visit with Japan’s new and first-ever female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, Trump and the Japanese PM put pen to paper on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement that aims to implement previous commitments made by Japan, as well as Japan’s pledged $550 billion investment in US sectors that will boost the US energy market to new levels under the directive of Trump.

The new agreement was signed in a ceremony that builds on previous trade and tariff agreements made in July of this year. The eye-watering $550 billion investment framework covers a wide range of US energy sectors, including but not limited to:

Energy infrastructure and production capacity

LNG production in the US

advanced fuels like biofuels

grid modernization

critical minerals mining

processing and refining in the upstream and midstream sectors

“The two leaders noted with satisfaction swift and continued efforts by both countries, and confirmed their strong commitment to implementing this GREAT DEAL. The Agreement will help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth, and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity.” – joint statement by the US and Japan

Japan’s commitment to invest in the US energy sector has set the tone for the market

US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, who heads up the “investment committee” responsible for selecting eligible projects, has noted that 10 to 12 Japanese companies have expressed interest in entering the US energy sector through the established investment framework.

Some of the projects and companies identified as part of the substantial investment framework are:

Westinghouse – A leader in the nuclear sector, the company has planned the construction of AP1000 nuclear reactors and small modular reactors alongside Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Group, and IHI.

Bechtel – the company has noted its plans to provide project management, engineering, procurement, and construction services for large-scale energy projects such as power plants, substations, and transmission systems.

Kinder Morgan – the energy firm will provide natural gas transmission alongside several Japanese energy companies. Kinder Morgan has the added benefit of working on a refined products pipeline in the US state of Texas.

Trump has been on a roll as of late, boasting at the meeting between himself and Japan’s new Prime Minister about his administration’s regulatory cuts and rapid project approvals in recent months as the US aims to increase energy production, an idea that Trump ran on for his second term in office.

Minister-in-charge of Science and Energy & Technology, Dr Tan See Leng, set the tone for the week with the Singapore Energy Lecture. Acknowledging the uncertainties brought on by geopolitical tensions, Minister Tan reassured the audience that Singapore will continue to strive to balance sustainability with security as it navigates the energy transition. The four pillars of this journey –Sustainable pathways, Interconnectivity, Ecosystem resilience and Workforce capabilities – were the cornerstone of his address.

Here are the key highlights of these announcements:

EMA also signed a Letter of Intent with the Idaho National Laboratory to affirm our commitment to collaborate on research, technology assessments, and capacity building for advanced nuclear technologies.

For Singapore, these partnerships represent a pivotal step in its long-term strategy to diversify its energy mix. With the US Department of Energy (DOE) approving Singapore’s inclusion in the Part 810 list of Generally Authorised Destinations for exports of controlled nuclear technology and assistance, this opens the door for deeper knowledge exchange and collaboration. This milestone brings Singapore closer to a future where nuclear energy may potentially be able to play a role in its sustainable energy mix.

As Singapore transitions to cleaner sources of energy, the need for a more flexible and resilient power grid is paramount. This is where distributed energy resources (DERS) – such as rooftop solar photovoltaics, battery energy storage systems or even electric vehicle chargers – come into play. These small-scale power generation units offer a solution to meet growing energy demands and enhance grid resilience alongside centralised power generation.

To support the integration of DERS into the grid, EMA launched the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) regulatory sandbox. This two-year pilot will assess the feasibility of managing a network of DERS to provide energy and ancillary services to the grid.

Alongside this, the Energy Grid 3.0 Grant Call was also introduced, inviting innovative solutions to enhance grid planning and operations. This initiative is crucial for managing complex grid challenges, such as maintaining stability and resilience when integrating renewable energy sources.

In another major step toward greater grid flexibility, EMA unveiled the Demand-Side Flexibility Roadmap to outline our plans to harness demand-side resources to meet the needs of the power grid caused by supply or demand fluctuations. A key feature of this roadmap is the enhancements made to the Interruptible Load (IL) programme, which will soon offer participants greater certainty by reducing each activation event to half an hour. EMA will also be exploring the feasibility and design of a new programme that would incentivise demand-side resources to provide contingency reserves for extended periods. Together, these initiatives will ensure that Singapore’s grid remains reliable and adaptable as the nation shifts to a low-carbon future.

One of the initiatives is the Institute of Technical Education (ITE)’s new Technical Engineer Diploma in Electrical Engineering (Clean Energy). This diploma, which provides students with a foundation in electrical engineering while equipping them in clean energy areas, is recognised by EMA for Licensed Electrical Technician (LET) licence application.

But the work does not stop there. To truly build a future-ready workforce, learning has to be continuous. That is why EMA has worked with Singapore Polytechnic and the Singapore Institute of Technology as part of the Green Skills Committee to offer continuing education programmes in emerging fields such as renewable energy integration and smart grid technologies.

We have also introduced an internship training plan for tertiary students to receive the necessary training and work experience that would better prepare them to become licensed electricians and licensed electrical technicians.

To support individuals and the workforce in navigating emerging opportunities, we have refreshed the Clean Energy Jobs-Skills Insight– a resource that spotlights emerging areas of work, jobs, and skills across the energy sector, and how new technologies are unlocking fresh possibilities for growth.

These initiatives ensure that the current workforce stays ahead of the curve, ready to harness emerging technologies and drive Singapore's energy transition.

Following the signing of the MOU on Energy Cooperation with Sweden in 2024, EMA co-hosted the inaugural Singapore–Sweden Forum with Team Sweden at SIEW 2025. The Forum brought together energy leaders from both countries to discuss hydrogen and other clean fuels, smart grids, and energy efficiency. The discussions paved the way for continued collaboration, especially in areas like regional energy interconnectivity and innovative clean energy technologies.

To further regional integration, EMA has partnered with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and The International Tracking Standard Foundation to develop the Cross-Border Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Framework. This framework will allow for cross-border tracking of renewable electricity, providing transparency and boosting confidence in the international renewable energy market.",https://ema.gov.sg/content/dam/corporate/news/feature-stories/shaping-the-future-of-energy-highlights-from-the-singapore-international-energy-week-2025/minister-tan-see-leng.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 23:59:19.308651
,Detroit and Evs,2025-11-24 01:18:12+00:00,Yahoo News,EV grant scheme boost worth £1.3bn expected in Budget - Yahoo,Georgia Roberts - Political correspondent; Patrick Jackson,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ev-grant-scheme-boost-worth-223838331.html,"The government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget.
The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.
""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""
""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.
""Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,"" the Conservative MP said.","The government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget.

The Electric Car Grant scheme started in July as part of the move to zero emission vehicles. The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.

However, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers.

There will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars.

It is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday's Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander the told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that subsidising EV sales would support economic growth.

""This is an investment in the country's future... and the good quality manufacturing jobs associated with that,"" she said, pointing to production of the Nissan Leaf in Sunderland.

""So making sure that we are enabling people to buy a new electric vehicle if that's what they want to do, whilst also investing in charging infrastructure, it is the right long-term decision.""

All new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.

The Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.

New AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK's transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent study that the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.

EVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.

""It isn't yet clear that it's prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn't have gone ahead and bought anyway,"" David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.

The Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.

Data from Zapmap shows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.

""The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of charge points and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking,"" the government said.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was ""expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge"".

However, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028 to mirror the fuel duty that drivers of petrol and diesel cars pay.

The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.

The transport secretary did not rule out a new tax on EV drivers' road use, saying support for the transition to EVs needed to be balanced with a ""fair vehicle taxation system for all motorists"".

""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""

""We've got ageing infrastructure, motorways that were built back in the sixties and seventies,"" Alexander said.

""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.

Reeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.

Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that ""handing out £1.5bn in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry"" was ""madness"".

""Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,"" the Conservative MP said.

Reeves is expected to increase some taxes in the Budget after saying she means to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lmsI_4hvvk5bJ0WUtjZwiw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/9b88648e89c5b2181d706e484817f494,N,,2025-11-23 23:59:23.691661

Moreover, federal investment in public power utilities will facilitate speed to power.
Data centers not only need to obtain power, “but they also require water and other utility services, which many public power utilities also provide.
In conclusion, APPA said public power utilities are committed to serving their communities with reliable, affordable power.","The American Public Power Association on Nov. 21 submitted comments to the U.S. Department of Energy in response to the DOE’s request for information on accelerating speed to power and winning the artificial intelligence race.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Sept. 18 announced the Speed to Power initiative, which is aimed at accelerating the speed of large-scale grid infrastructure project development for both transmission and generation.The Speed to Power initiative ""will help ensure the United States has the power needed to win the global artificial intelligence (AI) race while continuing to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable and secure energy,” DOE said.

“Public power utilities across the nation are expanding their capacity to serve new data center loads by building grid infrastructure, creating innovative rate structures, and partnering with data center developers,” APPA said in its comments.

“Some public power utilities have been serving data center loads for decades, powering the internet as we know it today,” it said.

“And in public power communities that seek to serve new artificial intelligence data centers, data center developers see benefit in partnering with public power utilities because their not-for-profit business model and local governance structure allow public power utilities to be nimble in meeting the needs of new data centers,” APPA told DOE.

“But significant barriers continue to constrain the ability of public power utilities to expand their capacity to serve new loads while protecting their existing customers from undue costs and risks. APPA therefore appreciates and applauds the efforts of DOE to strengthen the federal role in accelerating critical projects to enable the growth in electricity demand.”

Large-Scale Generation and Transmission Projects to Enable Load Growth

APPA noted that it conducted a survey of its members to identify generation and transmission projects in development and the barriers that are impeding the speed or increasing the cost of completing those projects.

Dozens of public power utilities have projects in development, ranging from early-phase partnerships for developing small modular nuclear reactors to natural gas plant upgrades to novel new geothermal plants.

Many individual projects are between 20 megawatts (MW) and 100 MW, while some larger public power utilities have portfolios of planned projects that would add several gigawatts of capacity to their systems.

“APPA is committed to collaborating with DOE to identify public power projects that would benefit from federal support and facilitating meetings with public power utilities that are developing projects of interest to DOE,” it said.

High-Priority Geographic Areas for Targeted DOE Investment

Public power communities “are particularly well suited for targeted federal investment to enable grid expansion that supports new electricity demand growth. Because public power utilities are not-for-profit, any federal investment to support those utilities is certain to benefit the local communities,” APPA said.

“APPA has a long history of coordinating with DOE on delivering funding and technical assistance to public power utilities that not only strengthen grid resilience but also result in tangible community benefits. Moreover, federal investment in public power utilities will facilitate speed to power. Because public power utilities are community-owned and locally governed, the support of local leaders for new data centers can alleviate local barriers to deployment,” it noted.

Data centers not only need to obtain power, “but they also require water and other utility services, which many public power utilities also provide. And developers need to navigate local siting and permitting requirements.”

As instrumentalities of state and local governments, public power utilities “can participate in whole-of-government efforts to enable data centers to successfully—and with all due speed—locate in communities that seek to attract such investment. As noted above, APPA is committed to meeting with DOE to identify public power utilities that would benefit from federal assistance.”

DOE Support for Large Scale Projects

APPA said it supports DOE’s efforts to use existing statutory authority to help development and deployment of generation and transmission projects.

“In the short term, financial assistance and technical assistance are critical to achieving speed to power. Additionally, DOE can play an important role in alleviating supply chain challenges and addressing workforce vulnerabilities.”

And DOE “must coordinate with other federal agencies to reduce barriers for expanding grid capacity,” it said.

APPA urged DOE to consider the following principles as it evolves its programs to support speed to power and expansion of grid capacity to meet growing demand reliably:

• Ensure financial and technical assistance is available to public power utilities

DOE should ensure that financial and technical assistance opportunities are available to all those willing – including public power utilities.

Conditions on assistance opportunities that are inconsistent with a not-for-profit business model and requirements that conflict with or duplicate obligations that apply to instrumentalities of the state or local governments should be avoided. Congress recognized, for example, that public power utilities’ tax-exempt status materially limited the ability of those utilities to benefit from certain tax incentives, and therefore added elective pay provisions to recent incentives that provide equal access to incentives for not-for-profit utilities.

DOE should similarly be cognizant of rules that inadvertently prevent public power utilities from accessing assistance, APPA said.

• Enable joint action among communities

Many public power utilities form “joint action agencies” that allow multiple utilities to work together to build generation and transmission that would not be possible for any of the individual utilities. Such joint action agencies should be eligible to apply for grants on behalf of their member utilities, which are often located in smaller, rural communities, APPA said. “This would help ensure projects are built that benefit smaller public power utilities and allow them to work together to achieve economies of scale on building significant generation and transmission projects.”

• Improve certainty and reduce burdens

Applicants for technical and financial assistance have often described the application process as unduly complex or burdensome, APPA noted. “Especially for small non-profit, community-owned public power utilities, application processes can be streamlined. For technical assistance, improved communication— such as a “one stop shop”—describing the range of programs available and eligibility requirements would allow for more utilities to make use of the programs. Furthermore, greater certainty around the durability of assistance programs will allow beneficiaries to more effectively plan and execute on projects that expand grid capability.”

Interagency Coordination

Achieving speed to power requires all federal agencies to coordinate to reduce barriers to building new generation and transmission, APPA said.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), federal land management agencies, and internal revenue service (IRS) all play important roles in alleviating barriers, so DOE should coordinate closely with them to prioritize grid expansion to serve growing demand, it said.

“The Department of Commerce can also play a role in addressing issues such as supply chain constraints. The National Energy Dominance Council has been—and should continue to be—an effective body for facilitating the interagency coordination that is need to accelerate speed to power.”

Environmental Protection Agency

APPA supports continued collaboration with EPA on reliability issues. “We urge DOE to conduct analysis of proposed EPA rules to determine whether they will unduly affect grid reliability or harm resource adequacy. DOE and EPA should also designate points of contact for permitting issues and hold joint technical workshops with stakeholders to address roadblocks and share best practices.”

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Natural gas remains a major source of electricity generation, and many APPA members are expanding their gas-fired power plants to serve growing demand, including new data centers. This often requires expansion of natural gas infrastructure. “DOE should continue its coordination with FERC to ensure adequate gas supply for power plants, as well as ensuring effective coordination between the gas and electric systems.”

Land Management Agencies

Wildfire risk is an impediment to building out the transmission grid, particularly in the West but throughout the country, APPA said.

“Today, electric utilities encounter numerous federal hurdles and delays when undertaking wildfire mitigation, grid hardening, and wildfire recovery actions to protect their systems and the communities they serve. These operational challenges pose a barrier to utilities planning to build more transmission to serve growing demand.”

Statutory changes to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) “are certainly needed, but land management agencies can take action immediately to reduce burdens for utilities, including by”:

• Further clarifying emergency hazard tree removal approval processes and have those policies consistent across regions and agencies;

• Clarifying regulations under the FLPMA that currently do not allow utilities to then remove the felled timber, slash, and other vegetation from the forest itself without undergoing a timber sale or donation process; and

• Expediting implementation of master service agreements combining multiple permits and updating expired with utilities that hold multiple operating and maintenance electric corridor permits.

Internal Revenue Service

APPA said IRS regulations can significantly impact whether a new infrastructure project gets built or not.

“Certainty and stability of those rules is critical to enabling new grid infrastructure. A tax issue that some public power utilities encounter is that the IRS limits “private use” of municipal bonds in ways that prevent public power from crafting innovative arrangements with data centers.”

A customized contract with a data center that lasts longer than three years and makes use of more than 10 percent of bond proceeds would, in the IRS’s view, likely be considered private use.

“DOE should coordinate with the IRS about the importance of crafting tax rules in a way that enables—rather than hinders—public power to serve growing loads, including data centers. Like EPA and land management agencies, the IRS does not have the goal of ensuring reliable electricity service at the lowest reasonable cost; DOE should therefore ensure that the IRS is (at minimum) informed about electric reliability and affordability challenges associated with new or existing tax rules.”

Public Private Partnerships

The RFI asks how DOE can leverage public-private partnerships to accelerate development of projects that address grid capacity and load growth.

“One type of public-private partnership with a proven track record is joint ownership of transmission. Joint ownership allows for all load-serving entities in the relevant footprint—including public power utilities—to participate in the ownership and development of new transmission projects. Such ownership structures lead to a collaborative and inclusive process for the planning, development, and financing of new transmission that results in a more efficient grid that can serve growing demand reliably,” APPA said.

Joint ownership can eliminate weak spots, make it easier to garner support for transmission projects, and lay an important foundation for the prompt siting of new transmission lines, the association noted.

“It may be the single most important factor in determining the success of a transmission project. There are many structures for inclusive joint ownership of transmission. In some regions, investor-owned utilities have partnered with public power utilities and rural cooperatives to form transmission companies that can own and operate new transmission facilities. In other regions, public power transmission owners have partnered with investor-owned neighbors to plan and operate transmission facilities jointly, as a single-system, pursuant to a long-term arrangement.”

Regardless of the structure, joint ownership arrangements have led to a collaborative and inclusive process for planning, developing, financing, and siting transmission, APPA said.

“Including public power in the ownership of transmission lines has facilitated effective planning and has helped manage cost allocation issues because the project is able to demonstrate multiple benefits by meeting the needs of several utilities. Moreover, public power ownership of transmission lines—even in small percentages—can attract political support for state and local approval processes. Given the significant benefits of the joint ownership model, DOE should consider all available tools to encourage and facilitate joint ownership as a proven model of public-private partnership.”

Barriers to Expanding Infrastructure

APPA said its members report a range of barriers that are slowing down infrastructure development and increasing costs.

Based on survey responses from members, major barriers include supply chain constraints, federal permitting, and regulatory uncertainty.

APPA elaborated on these barriers as follows:

Supply Chain Constraints

Many APPA members that are developing new generation and transmission projects are experiencing challenges with procurement of major materials, notably circuit breakers, switchgear, transformers, and turbines.

There are two main types of challenges: delays and price changes. Some suppliers have been informing APPA members that the equipment they ordered will be delayed by several months or even years, which has significant impacts on the overall project timeline, APPA said.

“And other suppliers are increasing the cost of equipment: multiple APPA members reported cost increases in the range of 15-20 percent from the time of a preliminary quote to the time of the order; others have reported price increases even after orders are completed. Tariff uncertainty also poses a barrier to completing projects on time and on budget.”

DOE should coordinate within the administration to consider targeted tariff exemptions for critical electric equipment and materials. Such an exemption would reduce uncertainty and allow all utilities to progress more quickly on getting new infrastructure built, APPA said.

Federal Permitting

“Projects that require federal permits face extraordinary delays in getting built. It regularly takes multiple years—even absent litigation—to get through NEPA review and other federal permitting requirements, even when the federal nexus is quite narrow (e.g., some amount of federal funding or an incidental take under the Endangered Species Act),” APPA said.

Litigation, which is very common in NEPA assessments for electric infrastructure, adds more years.

APPA noted that it has advocated pragmatic legislative changes that would streamline the permitting and siting process, provide clearer federal guidance, and produce timelier decisions.

Specifically, APPA said reforms should enhance: (1) predictability, so utilities know what to expect and when; (2) efficiency, through better agency cooperation and fewer duplicative steps; (3) transparency, by tracking project milestones openly; and (4) meaningful stakeholder input at each stage. Sustained funding for federal agencies is also critical, as under-resourced offices are often a root cause of slow permitting.

To address federal permitting, APPA supports H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, including (1) a limitation that an agency’s scope of review under NEPA be limited to major federal actions within the agency’s authority and control; (2) confirmation that federal assistance does not automatically constitute a major federal action; (3) clarification that reasonably foreseeable federal actions are actions directly under the control of the agency and have a close casual relationship to the proposed agency action; and (4) limiting unnecessary litigation.

The House Natural Resources Committee on Nov. 20 passed H.R. 4776 by a vote of 25-18.

In conclusion, APPA said public power utilities are committed to serving their communities with reliable, affordable power.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-23 21:58:17.442236

Such conditions including panic reaction among the disaster victims may even obstruct relief operation and their efforts to seek safety measures.
But analysis of websites containing AI-generated pictures of buildings provided some clues to the pictures spreading on the social media.
Though the media houses deleted the reports and regretted to have broadcasted those, it was circulating on the social media all the same.
But the worst public enemies are fearmongers who use the social media to spread fake reports and pictures of deaths and devastations that did never happen.","Whether it is fire, or storm, earthquake or flood, what the magnitude of devastation it would cause depends both on pre-calamity preparedness and post-calamity reaction of the population stricken by any disaster. The destruction in question is not just about deaths, injuries and loss of property. However, in our materialistic outlook, after deaths, collapse of buildings and other physical infrastructure gets the most attention. Attention to the victims of physical injury comes next. Unfortunately, in our society, victims of post-disaster psychological injury get the least attention. Nowadays, with the advent of social media, the psychological harm caused to the disaster victims has amplified due to information overload, misinformation and rumour. A research article published in the prestigious British science journal, Nature, in its July 27, 2024 issue stated that the widespread dissemination of negative online information might generate cyber violence or lead to serious adverse psychological outcomes.

The finding was the outcome of a study that considered a natural disaster event involving avoidable deaths and child casualties as an example to identify emotional contagion and simulation interventions. The data according to the study was derived from the aftermath of a flash flood in the Loncaogou Scenic Area, Sichuan Province, China. The analysis found that negative emotions were more persistent and contagious than positive emotions. That negative emotions spread and impact the audience, here the victims in a post-disaster dispensation, faster and deeper than positive emotions, we know from our everyday experience. Especially, rumours and fake reports about the fallouts from a disaster is a common experience in the present-day world. Except those deliberately involved in causing psychological trauma in a populace following a natural calamity, those behind such misinformation as well as disinformation are, often, unaware of the fact that the rumours and fake pictures of damage on the social media may cause widespread anxiety, depression, Post traumatic Disorder (PTSD) and other forms of fatal consequences. Such conditions including panic reaction among the disaster victims may even obstruct relief operation and their efforts to seek safety measures.

Consider the deluge of rumours and fake news that followed November 21 (Friday)'s earthquake in Bangladesh of which the epicentre was (at Narsingdi) not far from the capital city of Dhaka. Considering the actual number of deaths and damage to infrastructures so far reported since last Friday morning, the earthquake caused more psychological damage to the people across the country than physical harm. However, this is not meant to anyway belittle the casualties of the tremor so far reported. Every death counts and the families affected by such deaths know that whatever the reason behind the deaths, road accidents or earthquakes. But here we are concerned more about how social-media-created rumours following sudden disaster like earthquake might negatively impact the direct victims of the calamity or those who just listen to or read about those on the social media.

A fact check conducted by a local media house, for example, found that a picture was spreading on the social media to the effect an eight-storey building had collapsed in Dhaka following Friday's tremor. But a reverse search found that the image of the collapsed building doing the rounds on the social media bore some similarity to that of the Lafayette building of the Detroit city in the USA. The building is learnt to have been demolished in 2010. However, some difference in the image of the taken down Lafayette building which was a 14-storey (with one floor as basement) one, while the one in picture passing for the damaged building in Dhaka, was showing 11 storeys over the ground.

The fake picture about the so-called 'destroyed Dhaka building' had other points of difference with surroundings of the demolished Lafyette building in that the latter had high-rise structures around it. But the fake 'Dhaka building' did not have images of high-rise buildings surrounding it. However, the search to find if it (the fake collapsed Dhaka building) was created with the help of AI could finally come up with an answer. It was indeed done with help of AI. Similarly, there were also pictures of some leaning buildings among which was a two-storey one with a big crack in the middle, while other parts of the building showing as unaffected. Its picture was spreading on the facebook. The picture also had a poetic caption that said how helpless humans were before the forces of nature. However, reverse image search proved futile as no similar source image could be found. But analysis of websites containing AI-generated pictures of buildings provided some clues to the pictures spreading on the social media. Clearly, the picture of the part-bifurcated two-storey building has no copy in the real world. Also, take the fake video of the collapsed flyover at Diabari in the capital city. The fake video-link of the collapsed flyover was also spread to some Indian news media. The fake report was briefly carried by some news media in Dhaka. Analysis reached the conclusion that the picture of the collapsed flyover was hundred per cent AI-generated. Interestingly, some news media even circulated report of the tilted building of the Chief Adviser at Tejgaon. Though the media houses deleted the reports and regretted to have broadcasted those, it was circulating on the social media all the same. But the misinformed public, all of whom may not be educated enough to tell the real from the fake images, might be unduly panicked by such pictures or videos.

Many people, just out of fear, have already left Dhaka city to neighbouring districts with fewer buildings and more open spaces. Maybe those areas are safer in case of a devastating tremor striking the city. But if the city is the source of their livelihood, how long can they stay away from their work? For no one can predict when the next jolt will come -- it may be the next moment, the next week or a century later. Worse, no place on earth can guarantee one ultimate safety. Moreover, the earthquake-related fear arises mainly from the public's unfamiliarity with this kind of danger. But when it comes to familiar circumstances but with dangers lurking around there, people do not show signs of much fear. Consider, for instance, a bus travel in Bangladesh. Will the fear of a possible road accident leading to even death, which is a common experience in this country, stop a person from travelling?

So, what is important is to increase public awareness about the danger of earthquake or about any kind of disaster including fires, floods, storms or tsunamis. But the worst public enemies are fearmongers who use the social media to spread fake reports and pictures of deaths and devastations that did never happen.",https://tfe-bd.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posts/125763/p5-earthquake-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 01:58:43.364282

Project another part of Cook Government's Made in WA plan to create jobs and drive economic diversification

The Cook Government is backing the delivery of a WA-made vanadium battery for Kalgoorlie, creating jobs, strengthening regional power reliability and supporting the establishment of a new industry for Western Australia.

Installing a Vanadium Battery Energy Storage System (VBESS) is a major election commitment under the Cook Government's Made in WA plan, to diversify the economy, enable Western Australia to become a renewable energy powerhouse, and to make more things here.

The VBESS will be the largest of its kind in Australia and has the potential to help grow WA's advanced manufacturing industry and support the development of a new local supply chain around vanadium mining, processing and flow battery technology.

The project will be supported by $150 million in government funding.

The first part of a two-stage Expression of Interest opens today and runs until 30 January 2026, to identify and understand existing capabilities in the market. It is not part of a procurement process.

The government wants local businesses to play a role in delivering the project, working with industry to determine practical and achievable local content outcomes.

The project will involve the installation of a 50-megawatt/500 megawatt-hour, WA-made vanadium flow battery using locally sourced and processed vanadium capable of discharging for up to 10 hours.

Vanadium flow batteries are fire resistant, efficient in WA's hot climate, recyclable and scalable.

Stage Two of the EOI process, to be held in early-to-mid 2026, will evaluate detailed business cases, with the aim of selecting a preferred proponent to deliver the VBESS project.

More information is available on the Energy Policy WA website.

“The neurocognitive harms of fossil fuel pollution disproportionately impact children, older adults and communities already facing environmental and health inequities.
These communities are more likely to be low-income or communities of color, compounding the risks.” Similarly, mental health, kidney health, hormonal health, and reproductive health are all also negatively affected by fossil fuel pollution.
There is at least some good news about the damage to public health that is being done by fossil fuel pollution, including in Black and Brown communities: we know how to stop it.
As the report puts it, “the most powerful health protection strategy is to reduce climate pollution by transitioning away from fossil fuels.”","It’s by no means new news that there are myriad ways that extracting and burning fossil fuels — or making them into other products, like plastics — is bad for public health, and particularly so for Black and Brown Americans. But we still continue to burn methane, and gasoline, and even coal, so the point bears being made again (and again).

The latest to do so is a broad coalition of medical and health organizations that released a new report last week titled “Fueling Sickness: The Hidden Health Costs of Fossil Fuel Pollution.”

It makes the case that society’s ongoing reliance on fossil fuels is severely damaging public health already — particularly demographics overburdened by such pollutions, including Black and Brown Americans — and that it will only get worse as the effects of climate change get worse.

“Fossil fuels harm our health in more ways than most people realize,” Dr. Mark Vossler, board president at Physicians for Social Responsibility, one of the organizations that put out the report, said in a statement.

“This report makes it clear that every stage of the fossil fuel process, from extraction, to transportation, to burning for energy causes widespread damage to the heart, lungs, brain and other organs. Rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a public health imperative.”

A disproportionate burden

“Fueling Sickness” shows that fossil fuel pollution is everyone’s problem while also making it clear that it is even more of a problem for some groups, including Black Americans.

“A complex array of interconnected factors (including but not limited to historical redlining, lending discrimination, exclusionary land use policies, disinvestment and urban renewal projects) have resulted in low income and communities of color disproportionally living in areas with a greater concentration of polluting sources, like highways and factories, and thus have greater exposure to multiple pollutants from multiple sources,” the report reads.

“As a result, a higher percentage of racial minorities are exposed to particulate matter and ozone, contributing to a greater incidence of childhood asthma and other respiratory conditions.”

As the report notes, fossil fuels harm public health at every point of their production and use cycle, from extraction to refining to transportation to combustion — and the waste products made along the way, like coal ash, can make people sick, too.

Widespread health impact

Respiratory diseases like asthma are some of the most obvious effects of breathing polluted air. Fine particulate matter and other emissions generated by extracting and burning fossil fuels can damage other parts of the body, too, including the cardiovascular system and the brain, increasing the risk of neurological diseases.

Like so many of the negative consequences of fossil fuel pollution, the neurodegenerative effects are not evenly felt. “The neurocognitive harms of fossil fuel pollution disproportionately impact children, older adults and communities already facing environmental and health inequities. People living near busy roadways, diesel truck routes or polluting industries are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 and other air pollutants. These communities are more likely to be low-income or communities of color, compounding the risks.”

Similarly, mental health, kidney health, hormonal health, and reproductive health are all also negatively affected by fossil fuel pollution. According to the report, “one of the strongest associations between air pollution and negative birth outcomes like low birth weight and preterm birth are with power plants and petrochemical industries” — facilities that Black Americans are much more likely to live alongside than other people are.

The Physicians for Social Responsibility collaborated with a number of organizations, too: Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, Children’s Environmental Health Network, Climate Psychiatry Alliance, Climate Psychology Alliance North America, The International Society for Environmental Epidemiology North America Chapter, The Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, Medical Student for a Sustainable Future, the National Medical Association, Oncology Advocates United for Climate and Health, and the Public Health Institute.

Mike Bruan, Jaworowski has bullishly championed an all-of-theabove energy approach in the state, including building more wind, solar and natural gas generation infrastructure.
Counties that have impeded new energy development or placed moratoriums on solar and wind projects have drawn her ire.
The chair of the House utilities, energy and telecommunications committee said if counties continue to have the final say on energy projects, the state faces a dark future.","PERU — In 2017, an international energy developer began signing land-lease agreements in Miami County to build 75 wind turbines as part of a multi-county development.

Project leaders said the wind farm would produce up to 600 megawatts of electricity — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

A year later, the venture was dead.

Fierce pushback from local residents led county officials to approve a new wind ordinance with 2,000-foot setback requirements for the turbines that made the project nearly impossible to develop.

Larry West, then a Miami County commissioner who supported the wind farm, said losing the project cost the county and local school districts over $7 million in new tax revenue and robbed landowners who signed lease agreements of a lucrative new income source.

Eight years later, as electricity rates skyrocket and energy demand soars, losing the project has also cost Indiana what would have been a major new energy source, he argued.

“Our electricity is going to come from somewhere … and I think it’s going to have to be a combination of probably some green projects and nuclear modules,” he said.

BANNING CLEAN ENERGY

The situation in Miami County has played out time and again across Indiana, where county officials have total authority on zoning and permitting solar and wind projects.

But in the past two year, more counties than ever have started restricting clean-energy developments.

Of Indiana’s 92 counties, 64 have bans or impediments on new wind and solar projects as of September, according to an analysis by USA TODAY and the Indianapolis Star. That’s nearly double from just four years ago, when 34 counties had bans or restrictions.

Other counties, including Boone, Tippecanoe and Putnam, have also recently approved temporary moratoriums while officials consider their options.

The pushback comes as Hoosiers’ electricity bills are soaring and massive, energyguzzling data centers develop around the state, creating an unprecedented demand for more power.

Data centers being built for artificial intelligence in northern Indiana are projected to use more electricity by 2030 than every home in the entire state combined, according to Indiana Michigan Power.

Without county restrictions, wind and solar projects could have likely produced thousands of megawatts of new energy to help meet the state’s surging electricity demands, according to Hunter Jones, executive director of the Indiana Conservative Alliance for Energy.

“When it comes to solar, it’s in an especially worse position than it was a year or two ago. I think a lot of that has to do with changes going on at the federal level,” he said.

President Donald Trump blocked about $136 million for solar development in Indiana that federal lawmakers had approved under the Biden administration. A $6.7-million grant to expand the large solar array at the Indianapolis International Airport was also cut.

Trump’s open skepticism about clean energy has only further entrenched windand- solar opposition in conservative politics.

That sentiment is fueling resistance to clean-energy projects in Indiana, argued Topher Anderson, director of programs and operations for the conservative energy alliance.

He said that political rhetoric must be extracted from the state’s energy debate, which should focus on the science and economics of building out more wind and solar infrastructure.

“Go out to a transmission line, take that wire down and cut it open,” Anderson said, speaking hypothetically. “You’re not going to see red or blue electrons in there. You’re going to see the electrons that power your home.”

“We have to get back to focusing on these things without it being perceived as a red or a blue issue.”

NEW SECRETARY, NEW TONE

That sentiment is shared by Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s new secretary of energy and natural resources who served in the first Trump administration as a senior advisor on nuclear energy.

Since being appointed by Indiana Gov. Mike Bruan, Jaworowski has bullishly championed an all-of-theabove energy approach in the state, including building more wind, solar and natural gas generation infrastructure.

Counties that have impeded new energy development or placed moratoriums on solar and wind projects have drawn her ire. During an Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute luncheon in September, she said those restrictions are making the state unattractive to industries and new developments.

Jaworowski specifically slammed counties that engage with energy developers and “string them along” before ultimately killing a project.

“That’s disgraceful,” she said. “Personally, I think that those companies should start suing the communities and get serious about it.”

That’s exactly what one company is doing in Fountain County.

Dolphin Solar received a permit in December to build a 700-megawatt installation representing a $800 million investment. In September, a newly appointed zoning administrator, within minutes of starting the job, nullified the permit without explanation.

The company had spent years and invested more than $75 million to develop the project and is now suing, saying the decision is illegal and causing “irreparable harm.”

Jaworowski said those kinds of actions have spurred a new state effort to create a map of counties and communities that are open to new energy and industrial development so officials can tout those areas to companies interested in investing.

It’s the state’s way of “putting out a carrot” to incentivize counties to participate and attract new development in their communit ies, she explained during the luncheon.

Jaworowski urged county officials not to view developing more energy sources as a political undertaking, but as a patriotic duty to ensure the state can continue to provide reliable electricity.

“We are looking at a Hoover Dam moment,” she said during a video interview with the Indiana Business Journal’s Off the Record. “We are going to have to build nuclear plants, more gas plants and renewables, and Indiana really wants to be a leader on this front.”

‘BUY SOME CANDLES’

While Jaworowski proposes using proverbial carrots, other Indiana lawmakers want a more forceful way to stop county officials from impeding large-scale energy developments, including solar and wind.

Rep. Craig Snow, R-Warsaw, introduced legislation this year that would give the state total authority on zoning and siting multi-county projects that generate at least 50-megawatts of electricity.

Developers would no longer be required to get permits or approval from local governments, which would be barred from taking “specified actions concerning the siting, construction or deployment” of clean-energy projects.

The bill failed to pass out of committee but had the support of Republican Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. The chair of the House utilities, energy and telecommunications committee said if counties continue to have the final say on energy projects, the state faces a dark future.

“Buy some candles, because we’re not going to be able to meet the (electricity) demand,” Soliday said during a committee hearing in January.

Larry West, the former Miami County commissioner, said he would support more state regulation of solar and wind projects to create some uniformity on new developments.

“We generally like to see less big government, but I think sometimes it’s necessary to add some state controls or rules on something like this,” he said.

As it stands, allowing counties total authority to approve clean-energy projects has created unpredictability and inconsistencies that are major barriers to creating more electricity in the state, explained Jones, director of the conservative energy alliance.

Until that changes, Indiana can expect to lose out on billions of dollars of new investment and fall behind other states with modern zoning laws, he said.

“If Indiana cannot meet those needs, companies will go elsewhere,” Jones said. “That will cost us jobs, tax revenues for communities and jeopardize our long-term economic growth.”

The year-long initiative, undertaken in partnership with Global Citizen and backed by the International Energy Agency, seeks to expand electricity access, stimulate sustainable industrial growth, and accelerate Africa’s shift from fossil fuels to cleaner, modern energy systems.

The campaign also feeds into international efforts to scale renewable energy deployment and boost global energy efficiency.

The European Union contributed more than €15.1 billion of the total sum, while President von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, pledged over €10 billion, with the remainder coming from substantial bilateral contributions by EU Member States, European development finance institutions, and private investments mobilised through the campaign.

Speaking at the close of the pledging event in Johannesburg, von der Leyen said the global response demonstrated unprecedented support for Africa’s clean-energy ambitions.

She emphasised that the package has the potential to provide life-changing electricity access to millions of households, unlock new economic opportunities, and lay the foundation for thriving markets and new jobs.

She described the initiative as a future led by Africa but strongly supported by Europe, a partner she said remains committed to the continent’s long-term energy needs.

Team Europe’s commitments consist of new Global Gateway projects supported by contributions from Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, alongside the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Additional bilateral financing arrived from Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Austria and Ireland, while the EBRD announced an extra investment package exceeding €600 million.

The African Development Bank backed the campaign by pledging to allocate at least 20 per cent of the African Development Fund’s seventeenth replenishment to renewable energy. Norway also joined the effort with an estimated €53 million contribution through its support to the Fund between 2026 and 2028.

Organisers say the pledges secured through the initiative will generate 26.8 gigawatts of renewable energy and provide reliable electricity to 17.5 million households currently living without stable access.

According to a statement by the EU, the scale of these outcomes reflects the urgency of addressing Africa’s energy gap, with more than 600 million people still lacking electricity despite the continent possessing the world’s most abundant solar resources.

It noted that Africa attracts only a small fraction of global energy investment, and continues to face high financing costs, logistical barriers and supply chain challenges.

The “Scaling up Renewables in Africa” campaign was launched in November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro to galvanise governments, financial institutions, philanthropies and the private sector toward stronger clean-energy commitments.

It also helped build momentum toward global goals agreed at COP28, including tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030.

“Of the €10 billion pledged by President von der Leyen on behalf of Team Europe, €3.1 billion had previously been unveiled during key international summits throughout 2025, including the EU–South Africa Summit, the Mattei Plan event, the Africa Climate Summit, the UN General Assembly and the Global Gateway Forum.

“The remaining €7 billion was announced during the final pledging event in Johannesburg on 21 November.

“Several European institutions also signalled plans to increase renewable-energy investments by 2030, amounting to an additional €4 billion, demonstrating long-term commitment beyond the current campaign”, the statement reads.

The EU confirmed that the new financing commitments fall under the Global Gateway strategy, particularly the Africa-Europe Green Energy Initiative, which supports renewable energy generation projects, modern electricity grids, and regional power-trade infrastructure across the continent.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Nigerias-energy-transition-1.png,N,,2025-11-23 19:58:34.754197

Now Tesla has reversed course, dropping both the monthly payment and slashing the down payment by nearly two-thirds.
Tesla’s current deal is actually $19 per month cheaper despite the higher advertised monthly payment.
The loophole caused EV lease rates to skyrocket from 15% of transactions in 2022 to 67% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive.","Tesla has dropped the down payment requirement on Model 3 Premium RWD leases to just $1,500 while maintaining the $299 monthly payment, marking the automaker’s most aggressive pricing move since the federal EV tax credit expired two months ago.

The deal represents a 63% reduction in upfront costs compared to the $3,993 down payment Tesla required earlier this year. For a vehicle delivering 363 miles of range and premium features that once cost substantially more to lease, the new terms signal how dramatically the post-subsidy EV market has shifted.

Model 3 Premium Delivers Serious Value at $299 Monthly

The Model 3 Premium RWD now leasing for $299 per month isn’t a stripped-down base model. This is the same vehicle Tesla marketed as the Long Range RWD through most of 2025, offering 363 miles of EPA-estimated range and acceleration from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds.

Standard equipment includes heated and ventilated front seats, a panoramic glass roof, premium audio with 17 speakers, and Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) hardware. The rear features a touchscreen display for passengers, customizable ambient lighting throughout the cabin, and power-folding heated side mirrors.

Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system comes standard, providing automatic steering, acceleration, and braking within marked lanes under driver supervision.

The lease terms require $1,500 due at signing for a 36-month contract with 10,000 miles annually, plus a $695 acquisition fee and first month’s payment. That brings the total initial outlay to roughly $2,494 before taxes.

Pricing Whiplash: From $249 to $529 and Back to $299

Tesla’s Model 3 lease pricing has experienced wild swings throughout 2025 as the company adapted to shifting market conditions and the looming expiration of federal subsidies.

In February 2025, according to CarsDirect, Tesla briefly offered the Model 3 for $249 per month with $3,943 down. That deal made the electric sedan cheaper to lease than a Honda Civic.

By March, Tesla raised the monthly payment back to $299 with $3,993 down. The automaker maintained those terms through the summer as consumers rushed to purchase EVs before the September 30 tax credit expiration.

October brought sticker shock. After the tax credit disappeared, Tesla initially raised Model 3 lease prices to between $409 and $529 per month, representing increases of up to 23% as the company attempted to offset lost subsidy revenue.

Now Tesla has reversed course, dropping both the monthly payment and slashing the down payment by nearly two-thirds.

The Math Tesla Doesn’t Want You to Calculate

The current $299 monthly deal with $1,500 down works out to an effective monthly cost of approximately $340 when spreading the down payment over 36 months.

Compare that to the February offer: $249 monthly with $3,943 down produced an effective monthly cost of $359. Tesla’s current deal is actually $19 per month cheaper despite the higher advertised monthly payment.

But here’s the critical detail. When Tesla offered $299 monthly in the summer of 2025, lessees received a $7,500 federal tax credit that the leasing bank claimed and passed through as reduced payments. Tesla didn’t absorb those costs.

Without that subsidy, Tesla is now eating roughly $208 per month in reduced revenue ($7,500 divided by 36 months) compared to what the federal government was subsidizing just two months ago. The reduced down payment represents another $69 monthly loss when amortized over the lease term.

Tesla is essentially recreating the economics that existed when federal tax credits were available, but doing it with company money instead of taxpayer dollars.

Post-Subsidy Reality Hits Hard

The federal $7,500 EV tax credit for new vehicles and $4,000 credit for used EVs expired September 30, 2025, eliminated by legislation that accelerated an end date originally set for 2032.

The market impact has been severe. According to market analysis firm Omdia, October 2025 EV sales dropped 24% compared to September, falling from 98,289 units to just 74,897 units in a single month.

Tesla managed to report record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 vehicles by capitalizing on the pre-expiry rush. But CEO Elon Musk warned of rough quarters ahead during July earnings calls, acknowledging that the tax credit elimination would make EVs effectively $7,500 more expensive for buyers.

General Motors announced layoffs of more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities in late October. Ford halted F-150 Lightning production indefinitely. The entire industry is recalibrating for a market without the federal support that drove much of the recent EV sales growth.

Competition from Tesla’s Own Used Inventory

Tesla faces pressure not just from reduced consumer demand but from a flood of off-lease vehicles returning to market.

Nearly 1 million EVs were leased between 2022 and early 2025 under favorable terms created by a tax code loophole. Those leases qualified as commercial sales, allowing banks to claim the $7,500 credit and pass savings to consumers through reduced monthly payments.

The loophole caused EV lease rates to skyrocket from 15% of transactions in 2022 to 67% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive. Now those leases are maturing, with 123,000 vehicles returning in 2025 alone.

A Model 3 leased for 36 months returns to market with roughly 36,000 miles and typically prices between $25,000 and $30,000. That’s 20-30% below new vehicle pricing and creates direct competition for Tesla’s new car sales.

EVXL’s Take

Tesla’s lease pricing gymnastics reveal an uncomfortable truth about the EV industry that legacy automakers and startup EV makers don’t want to acknowledge: the entire market was built on a foundation of government subsidies that disguised the real economics of electric vehicle ownership.

We’ve been tracking this story for months. When Tesla eliminated the down payment on Model Y leases just last week, we noted the company was absorbing roughly $3,000 in upfront costs plus free upgrades to maintain competitive pricing. Now we’re seeing the same strategy extend to the Model 3.

The pattern is clear: Tesla initially raised prices by up to 23% when the tax credit expired in October, discovered that consumers wouldn’t pay those rates, and has now reversed course by essentially subsidizing its own vehicles to the tune of $200+ per month per lease.

This isn’t sustainable long-term business strategy. It’s panic.

As we reported when Trump touted a vehicle loan interest deduction that replaced the tax credit, the new policy provides a fraction of the financial support the eliminated credit delivered. A loan interest deduction might save buyers $500-$1,000 annually. The tax credit provided $7,500 upfront.

Tesla’s third-quarter performance, which we analyzed in our October earnings coverage, showed record deliveries built entirely on pulled-forward demand before the subsidy expired. Q4 and 2026 will reveal whether Tesla can maintain volume without either federal subsidies or company-funded subsidies eating into margins.

The flood of returning lease vehicles we documented in our July coverage of the used EV market adds another pressure point. Why lease a new Model 3 for $299 monthly when you can buy a three-year-old one for $25,000 and own it outright?

Here’s what Tesla won’t say publicly: the $299 lease with $1,500 down is probably losing money on every transaction when accounting for the subsidies Tesla is now self-funding. The company is betting that maintaining sales volume and market share matters more than per-unit profitability right now.

That might be correct if Tesla can sustain losses long enough to force competitors out of the EV market entirely. But it’s a brutally expensive strategy when you’re already dealing with falling regulatory credit revenue, rising competition from Chinese manufacturers, and the reality that your core product just became 15-20% more expensive overnight due to policy changes.

The Model 3 lease deal is aggressive. It’s also desperate. And it confirms everything we’ve been saying about subsidy dependency in the EV market since the tax credit expiration was first proposed.

Six months from now, we’ll see whether Tesla’s bet on absorbing these costs pays off or whether the company joins the rest of the industry in scaling back EV production and refocusing on hybrid vehicles that don’t require government support to achieve market-competitive pricing.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_8862-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 18:59:15.418830

On Wednesday November 19, the Town of Lansing Board withdrew its proposed moratorium (presumably aimed at the proposed TeraWulf data center) on large scale development. The issue was first brought forward at a board meeting in September. The moratorium was extensively discussed by both the board and public and has been reported by local media. There was at least one previous public hearing on October 15, with speakers both pro and con airing their points of view. Another public hearing was set for November 19. Then on November 14, the town announced that the public hearing was cancelled, and that a motion to withdraw the moratorium would be on the agenda.

TeraWulf had threatened legal action if the moratorium was passed. Note that the proposed data center would at peak capacity draw enough electricity to power over 200,000 homes, according to calculations by associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University, Daniel Cohan as reported in an article from CBS, Austin Texas. I spoke at the board meeting last week on my own behalf after the moratorium was withdrawn, urging the board to reconsider a moratorium on large-scale developments. I noted that it would put a huge demand on our power grid when we are currently falling behind the pace to reach our state’s mandated goal of producing 70% of our electricity by the year 2030 without producing climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions. I noted also that it would be vital to have strict noise standards to prevent noise pollution locally and across the lake, and that to prevent degradation of aquatic life it would be necessary to screen the water intake and return the water cooled sufficiently to prevent harmful blooms of algae in the lake. Note that this data center is just one of thousands being proposed and built around the world. We know that greenhouse gas emissions do cause global warming, which in turn increase severe heat, fires, droughts, crop losses, hurricanes, floods, loss of glaciers and polar ice, rising sea levels with loss of coastlines and islands, loss of wildlife, severe economic losses, and mass migration. Currently, necessary environmental efforts to transition from carbon-based energy production to non-polluting energy generation and building materials are being blamed for the lack of affordability in this country. This year Governor Hochul has stopped or delayed implementation of several vital programs passed by the state legislature, with the lack of ""affordability"" being a major reason for doing so. However, investigation of these programs and clean energy alternatives (as mandated by law) show that solar and wind are the cheapest forms of energy to generate and that nuclear is the most expensive and most time intensive to get online. And the immense costs to our environment and societies by uncontrolled global warming and climate change would be vastly more financially expensive and destructive to our world, as noted by the above.

It is unclear at this time if the town board will enlist the aid of the planning board and zoning board to draft another moratorium and set of zoning regulations to limit or prevent the harm of businesses that would otherwise pollute in such a severe degree, also helping to drive up the cost of electricity for everyone. If such large-scale operations are allowed to operate in the Town of Lansing, with such huge energy demands, and with such huge climate-changing emissions, then they should be obligated to ensure that the energy that they use is clean energy, whether it is produced on-site, or developed newly off-site within New York State. Energy credits of dubious authenticity should be disallowed.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/sce-uploads/sharing/FLG_Header_1440_400.JPG.webp?itok=eIP204m0,N,,2025-11-23 22:58:26.109715

The long-awaited, recently introduced environmental protection bill seeks to establish a national environmental protection agency and require development projects to report their carbon emissions.
The government insists that when the bill is passed, it will yield several demonstrable benefits for nature and establish a new ministerial authority to set national environmental standards.
Those standards were the centrepiece of the review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 undertaken by Professor Graeme Samuel.","The Federal Government wants its environmental protection laws passed in the Senate this week before parliament breaks for Christmas. Environment Minister Murray Watt says he is confident the laws will pass, but he’s not sure which party will help make it happen.

“It’s really a matter of whether it’s with the Coalition or the Greens,” he said on Monday morning (24 November).

“And the decision they’ve got to make this week is do they want to be part of passing historic reforms to our national environment reforms, or do they want to see the other side get in on the action and do it with us instead.”

The overhaul of Australia’s environmental protection laws seemed one step closer with the Federal Opposition signalling it is open to passing them.

But there’s a catch: Labor has to agree to a few Coalition proposals.

Because the government has an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives, the legislation easily passed there shortly after its introduction.

But it is in the Senate where Labor needs support from either the Coalition or the Greens to pass the legislation.

Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said on Friday morning (21 November) that she would be open to her team in the Upper House passing the government’s legislation if a few fairly significant tweaks were made to it.

The Opposition wants the bill to better define what would be known as an “unacceptable impact” on the environment and, on the flip side, what a “net gain” would mean from a proposed development.

“We are up for a sensible conversation about how to get this right, because we do want to see projects with a shorter timeline than they have right now,” Ms Ley said.

“What we’ve done is propose sensible changes to the government’s laws because we want them to work for business, industry, and of course, the environment, which needs protection.”

The Coalition wants to amend the legislation’s penalty provisions for environmental protection breaches, saying the size and scope of the penalties as they currently stand in the proposed laws need revisiting.

The Opposition also wants the powers of a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) changed to ensure the environment minister of the day maintains full final authority over development assessments.

The long-awaited, recently introduced environmental protection bill seeks to establish a national environmental protection agency and require development projects to report their carbon emissions.

However, the legislation specifically rules out a climate trigger that would prevent projects from going ahead.

The suite of legislation is more than 1400 pages and includes provisions for a federal environment minister to approve projects on the grounds of the national interest, even if they don’t tick off all environmental guidelines.

It also allows for no-go zones where projects can be denied before applications are progressed.

Environment Minister Murray Watt said the proposed reforms must be passed now after recent years of failed attempts.

The government insists that when the bill is passed, it will yield several demonstrable benefits for nature and establish a new ministerial authority to set national environmental standards.

Those standards were the centrepiece of the review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 undertaken by Professor Graeme Samuel.

Senator Watt said stakeholders broadly supported the proposed standard.

It emerged over the weekend that Senator Murray has offered concessions to the Greens on native forest logging and on removing fossil fuel projects from fast-tracked approvals under a new “national interest” mechanism in the proposed new laws.

But the Minister said on Monday that he was not prepared to go further and add a climate trigger to legislation.

“You will have seen over the weekend that we said that we are prepared to remove fossil fuel projects from the national interest approval mechanism that is included in the bill,” he told ABC radio.

“So I guess that’s a bit of a nod towards the concerns around climate change and fossil fuels. But no, we won’t be including climate considerations.”

Greens leader Larissa Waters said on Friday that the federal government needs to “pick a side” with whom it wants to strike a deal to get the legislation through.

She said choosing the Greens’ proposed amendments will make sure the new laws really do protect the environment.

Accepting the Coalition’s amendments, she said, is dealing with big fossil fuel developers who have little regard for the environment.

The Greens, who have the sole balance of power in the Senate, want the legislation to include an end to native forest logging and no fast-tracking of coal and gas projects.

But they also want the new laws to consider climate impacts when approving developments, which the current legislation specifically rules out.

“They need to pick a side, and if they want to have reforms that will actually protect nature, then they know to come and talk with the Greens,” Senator Waters said.

“If the government can’t even come at those things, it’s pretty clear they’re not environmental laws – they’re laws for business.”

Senator Waters described the legislation as it currently stands before the Senate as a “huge backward step” for the environment.",https://region.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sussan-Ley-with-the-Oppositions-Energy-Policy-Photo-Sussan-Ley-Facebook-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 19:00:06.765608

Policy whiplash, the end of a leasing era, and a crowded market are creating a complicated landscape for EV makers, and a price war could be coming down the pike. Times are very tough for EV makers, but may be shaping up to be better than ever for EV buyers.

A record number of EV leases will be returned in the United States in 2026, causing a surge in used EV supplies and therefore making the used vehicles more affordable than ever before. At least 243,000 EV leases are set to expire, and a recent study from J.D. Power projects that this figure could reach 330,000, representing a 3-fold increase over 2025 levels.

Accordingly, Auto Blog reports that an “EV Avalanche” is in store, and with incentives expiring and inventories rising across used car lots, a price war is likely to make the vehicles even cheaper than gas cars. But will consumers embrace the newly affordable technology? Experts aren’t so sure.

EV policy is undergoing a massive shift in the United States as the Trump administration pulls the plug on industry incentives. The $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles expired on September 30 of this year. “With EV tax credits expiring, and automakers continuing to prioritize hybrid powertrains, drivers may choose to ditch electrification,” says Auto Blog. “Though EV sentiment remains high, the electrification bubble is showing some stress.” Currently, EVs represent only six percent of new vehicle sales, down from 12.9 percent in September, when sales surged as consumers rushed to buy before tax credits ended.

As a result, automakers including Ford, Kia, and General Motors are cutting back on their EV manufacturing for U.S. markets. “They're explicitly delaying when they're going to bring out new models, or in some cases, pulling back models,” Elaine Buckberg, senior fellow at Harvard's Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability and former chief economist at General Motors, recently told Marketplace. “They're just not moving as ambitiously into the market as they had been planning to six months ago.”

“They're looking at this landscape where they're facing multibillion dollar tariff hits, so they really need to think about their profitability,” Buckberg went on to say.

Those tariffs are causing turmoil on the other end of the trade route as well. When the largest economy in the world is facing market uncertainty, global markets feel the impact. China’s Xiaomi corporation, which produces EVs and smartphones, among other technologies, has seen a remarkable crash in recent months, going from being the market darling to the nation’s worst-performing tech stock seemingly overnight.

Meanwhile, Beijing is fighting hard to pressure Western powers to reverse their 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs by targeting farmers in Canada, Europe, and the United States. “Beijing has levied billions of dollars of agricultural sanctions against the U.S., the European Union, and Canada, after they imposed duties on Chinese EVs to protect their own automakers,” says a Rest of World report from this week. “China has said it will lift farm tariffs only when Western governments drop EV duties.”

Despite extreme volatility in the global EV sector and a “grim” outlook going forward in the United States, there is still hope for the future of EVs worldwide. EV sales are still going strong in many regions around the world, and will continue to pick up as EVs continue to get cheaper – brutal price wars within the Chinese market ensure that prices in markets without tariffs will remain low. The International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 projects that “despite uncertainties in the outlook, the share of electric cars in overall car sales is set to exceed 40% in 2030 under today’s policy settings.”

Coal’s not coming back Rhetoric is one thing, but reality is another.","Once upon a time, digging rocks out of the ground and burning them to create steam was America’s best source of energy and economic growth. But technology’s relentless progress has obviated a technology that debuted in Victorian England, and coal-fired power cannot compete economically with clean energy.

So what is coal’s future in the United States?

Coal’s proponents say surging electricity demand from the AI data center boom and hundreds of millions in subsidies from the Trump administration promise a rebirth for aging, expensive power plants. But coal composes just 15 percent of U.S. electricity generation, and total electricity generated from coal is down 67 percent from its 2007 peak, primarily due to simple economics – coal is more expensive than cleaner power sources like wind, solar, batteries, and gas.

While demand growth, bailouts by the federal government, and clean energy incentive repeals may slow this downward spiral, the last large coal-fired power plant to open in America came online in 2013 and no new coal plants are proposed in the U.S.

And what’s left isn’t sticking around. Half of the remaining U.S. coal fleet – 93 gigawatts of capacity – is still planned for retirement by 2035. State regulators and utilities have planned these retirements because they know clean energy cuts consumer costs, cleans the air, and creates a more reliable grid.

Coal plants are more expensive, dirtier, and keep breaking down

As of 2021, 99 percent of the country’s existing coal fleet costs more to operate than replacing that generation capacity with new, local clean energy technology. Meanwhile, the cost of running coal plants rose 28 percent from 2021 to 2024, nearly double the rate of inflation over that time, forcing consumers to pay $6 billion in unnecessary energy bills.

This harms families in states that still rely on coal – states with coal-heavy power supply have seen power prices rise faster than those that have embraced clean energy.

Coal is also the dirtiest available source of energy. Burning those crushed up rocks spews more air pollution into the air than any other fossil fuel, releasing toxins like mercury and sulfur dioxide that cause asthma in humans and form acid rain. Even technologies like carbon capture don’t catch pollution like nitrogen oxide or heavy metals, and communities near coal plants often have their region’s highest rates of respiratory disease.

If the reason for keeping coal online is to prevent blackouts, then we’ve embarked on a fool’s errand. The average U.S. coal plant is now 44 years old, and as with most things hitting middle age, they’re getting harder to maintain. North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) data shows coal plants break down more frequently than gas, hydro, or nuclear generation with an average unplanned outage rate of 11.4 percent between 2020-2023, up from 8 percent between 2014-2017.

Third-party analysis of NERC data reports coal has the highest “equipment-related outage rate” or how often a generator is broken due to a mechanical issue – in fact coal plants are offline twice as much as wind turbines.

Oh and, Sandy Creek, America’s newest coal plant, the Texas facility that came online in 2013? It broke down in April 2025 and won’t be back online until at least 2027. Meanwhile wind, solar, and batteries have met that state’s 5 percent increase in demand across 2025.

Forcing plants to stay open with federal subsidies won’t help

It is true that the U.S. Department of Energy has begun forcing coal-fired plants that were scheduled to retire to stay open under an “energy emergency” executive order, but that action will cost consumers millions while taking away states’ rights to determine how to run their grid.

Michigan’s J.H. Campbell plant was forced to stay open past its planned retirement this May, even though the state’s top energy regulator said “no energy emergency exists.” That decision has already cost ratepayers $80 million, or $615,000 a day. Additional DOE orders to force coal plants to stay online could increase consumer costs $3 to $5 billion annually.

Other administration actions to prop up the teetering coal fleet are expected to similarly fall flat. $625 million in federal funds was re-appropriated to modernize existing coal plants or extend their life, but individual plant upgrades like this can cost hundreds of millions per plant. 13 million acres of public lands are expected to opened up to coal mining, but several failed sales of coal mining rights this fall returned bids of less than one cent per ton of coal.

And the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that even if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules to cut smokestack pollution from power plants are repealed, coal generation will still fall to 7 percent of U.S. electricity generation by 2035.

EVs Just Keep Getting Better, Tax Credits Or Not

The news about EVs in the US has been mixed this year, to say the least. The zero emission movement suffered a crushing blow over the summer when US President Donald Trump signed a new federal tax bill into law. The new law prematurely killed a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs (and $4,000 for used), with the expiration date set for this past September 30.

As predicted, sales surged ahead of the September deadline only to crash in October. However, the seeds of recovery have already been planted. Though some automakers have cut back their near-term EV manufacturing plans, GM and Ford are among the automakers adopting new LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery technology as part of a renewed focus on reducing costs in the years to come. Both companies are also excited about the affordability potential of new LMR (lithium manganese rich) batteries, too.

Just one year ago, Nissan also indicated a strong interest in LFP batteries. However, in May of this year, the company scuttled plans for a new LFP battery factory in Japan, adding to concerns that the automaker is teetering on the brink.

Nissan Rises From The LFP Ashes

Teetering or not, earlier this week, Nissan earned props for itself, and for the entire vehicle electrification movement, when the company announced that its 2026 LEAF electric SUV made the cut for North American Utility Vehicle of the Year, in the North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year award program.

The ultimate NACTOY winners won’t be announced until mid-January at the Detroit Auto Show, but in the meantime, Nissan is taking full advantage of the publicity.

“The North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year™ awards are judged by an independent panel of 50 automotive journalists from the U.S. and Canada. Evaluation criteria include innovation, design, safety, driver satisfaction and overall value,” Nissan observed in a press statement.

Nissan also enthused at length about the 2026 Sentra, an ICE vehicle that earned a Top 3 Finalist slot in the Car of the Year category. However, the real achievement is getting an EV into one of the Top 3 slots, in a competition that does not distinguish between battery power and internal combustion engines.

“The third-generation LEAF redefines what value means for a new model in the electric vehicle segment,” Nissan emphasized, noting that the starting point of $29,990 for the S+ grade is “the lowest starting MSRP for any new EV currently on sale in the US.”

Nissan also took the opportunity to tout the LEAF’s EPA-estimated range of 303 for combined highway-urban driving and its DC fast charging speed of 35 minutes to go from 10% to 80%.

Nissan Is Still Alive & Kicking

Although things looked gloomy for Nissan overall at the end of last year, this year the company’s EV sales in the US started off on the right foot. In January, CleanTechnica noted a significant sales spurt for both the LEAF and the ARIYA. The launch of the sleek, stylish 2026 LEAF in June promised more to come.

If the awards cycle is any indicator, Nissan has a winner on its hands. Prior to earning its Top 3 NACTOY slot, the 2026 LEAF also pulled a trifecta in the new “Buzz Awards” hosted by several publications under the umbrella of Valnet Auto Group.

The hat trick followed recognition from Wards Auto in September, when the 2026 LEAF garnered a slot in the firm’s “10 Best Engines & Propulsion Systems” award program.

“The advanced 3-in-1 next-generation electric powertrain integrates the motor, inverter and reducer into a single compact unit. This design reduces weight and size, improves energy efficiency and enhances driving dynamics,” Nissan explains.

CleanTechnica also weighed in with some first-hand observations from a sneak peek hosted by Nissan in September. “Driving the new Nissan LEAF, we found it to be extremely capable and well mannered on everything from city streets, to high speeds on freeways, to aggressive sprints through backcountry corkscrews,” reported CleanTechnica’s Kyle Field (see lots more details, with photos, about the LEAF drive here).

The 800-Pound EV Maker In The Room

Of course, no story about the US electric vehicle market is complete without a mention of Tesla. Unlike normal automakers, whose CEOs are familiar names almost exclusively within automotive circles, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has inserted himself into every corner of the global conversation, venturing far beyond nuts and bolts into politics, gender identity, and gaming, among other topics, always emerging on the side of white supremacy and fascism if not outright Nazism.

Right-wing extremism has been a feature, not a bug, of Musk’s public persona over recent years, though with little or no impact on sales of Tesla EVs until last year, when his effect on the company’s brand reputation finally became impossible to ignore.

Last year’s sales dropoff gathered speed during the run-up to Election Day 2024, when Musk devoted a reported $277 million to help push US President Donald Trump into office. The bleeding has continued into this year, highlighted by Musk’s new role as Deconstructor-in-Chief of the US government as head of Trump’s “DOGE” office.

With all this in mind, it’s little wonder that CarBuzz has tapped Tesla as the “most avoided EV brand in the world.” Citing a recent survey by the Global EV Alliance, CarBuzz journalist Lou Cataldo noted that in years past, when ICE vehicles ruled the roost, brand loyalty was a significant choice factor. In the new world of EVs, though, new patterns of car buyer choice are emerging.

“One particular trend has emerged: prospecting buyers avoiding certain brands for political reasons. In this part of the survey, Tesla has emerged as the most frequently mentioned brand, with 41% of respondents saying they would avoid the brand due to politics,” Cataldo wrote.

“It’s not hard to make a connection to Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, who has become a highly controversial figure in recent years,” Cataldo added.

Ya don’t say. By way of comparison, if you can name the CEO of Nissan off the top of your head, run right out and buy yourself a cigar (that would be Ivan Espinosa, appointed to the position in March). Bonus points if you can name the chairperson of the company’s Americas division (Chritian Meunier, appointed in March).",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nissan-2026-leaf-ev-kyle-field.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 17:58:51.789275

The answer lies in the region-specific approaches to vehicular testing. In Europe, the WLTP replaced the far too optimistic NEDC in September 2017 for new models and September 2018 for all new registrations.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency enforces a more stringent methodology, with the EPA testing vehicles differently from its European counterpart due to different driving realities. China relies on the famously exaggerated CLTC, which emphasizes long idle times and low-to-moderate speeds.

Given the headaches created by these discrepancies, autoevolution has decided to strip away the confusion by dissecting all three standardized driving cycles for light-duty vehicles. After that, mathematical correction factors will help us come up with a unified framework that should facilitate decoding the fuel economy and electric driving range estimates better than before.

The WLTP or Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure

In the continent where the modern automobile was born, the European Union adopted the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure in 2017. It was a long time coming, for it replaced a driving cycle that features mild acceleration, low maximum speeds, and long periods of idling for inflated figures. The New European Driving Cycle was born in the 1970s.

The WLTP's core objective is not real-world driving conditions, but global harmonization, which explains the first two words in its name. The Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure is based on the World Light Vehicle Test Cycle, a specific laboratory test conducted on a chassis dynamometer that lasts approximately 30 minutes.

Over those minutes, a vehicle covers 23.25 kilometers (14.45 miles) in four driving phases. The shortest one simulates congested urban driving. Frequent acceleration from rest and stops are included, along with a maximum speed of 56.5 kph (35.1 mph). The medium-speed phase simulates city and suburban driving in lighter traffic at speeds no higher than 76.6 kph (47.6 mph).

In the medium-speed phase, a mix of sustained medium-speed driving and dynamic acceleration increases the overall power demand on the vehicle. The high-speed phase models rural highways and high-speed roads, lasting for a sustained period. This, in turn, means that aerodynamic drag begins to become a major factor in energy consumption, be it electricity, gas, or diesel.

The high-speed test, which tops 97.4 kph (60.5 mph), is joined by the extra high-speed phase of the WLTC. As implied, vehicles are pushed all the way to 131.1 kph (81.5 mph) to simulate motorway driving scenarios. WLTC testing is conducted at 23 degrees Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit). Said temperature avoids the massive energy drain required for thermal management.

During the WLTC test, the cabin heater and air conditioning system are not used. Also worth noting, the WLTP testing process for plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles starts with a full battery, measuring energy consumption as the vehicle primarily runs on electricity rather than fossil-fuel muscle.

The complementary on-road test follows suit, with the subject vehicle being tested over a wide range of conditions that include high and low altitudes, year-round temperatures, uphill and downhill driving, and so forth. Referred to as RDE, the Real Driving Emissions test supplements the lab-based WLTP test.

Think of the RDE as a check on the WLTP lab results. Unlike the NEDC, the WLTP utilizes a mathematical formula to determine optimal gear shift points for each manual transmission vehicle. This makes it nigh-on impossible for manufacturers to make noteworthy software optimizations for improved results.

As opposed to the New European Driving Cycle, in which a vehicle was tested in the most basic (and lightest) configuration, the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure takes into account the impact of all major optional equipment for more realistic test results. From larger wheels to aerodynamic spoilers, the premium audio system, and the sunroof, these variables are taken into consideration by the type approval authority.

Larger wheels increase rolling resistance, whereas an optional rear wing increases drag, thus leading to different fuel economy ratings from the standard configuration. This brings us to the granularity of the WLTP's min/max rating. Max stands for the most efficient configuration, and the min rating is for the least efficient setup.

To better understand how big of a difference the WLTP makes over NEDC, remember that the New European Driving Cycle had two test phases (urban and extra-urban tests) conducted over 20 minutes at temperatures of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). The gear shift points are fixed to boot, and the average speed is nearly 50 percent lower when compared to the WLTP.

Even the standstill time differs, with vehicles being idle approximately 25 percent of the NEDC testing cycle instead of 13 percent for the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure. At the end of the day, the WLTP acknowledges more specifications, driving habits, and traffic scenarios than the NEDC.

The Environmental Protection Agency's fuel economy and driving range testing

An ocean's distance away from Cabo da Roca in Portugal, the EPA is responsible for setting and enforcing the motor vehicle standards for pollutant emissions, driving range, and fuel economy. Established under the Nixon administration in December 1970, the federal agency uses a five-cycle test procedure for internal combustion vehicles and a multi-cycle test procedure for EVs.

The EPA's approach to fuel economy, driving range, and pollutant emissions is noticeably stricter than the European continent's preferred testing procedure, with the self-imposed strictness resulting in a closer representation of real-world driving conditions. When it comes to methodology, a chassis dynamometer is used for testing at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Michigan or by the manufacturers themselves.

Internal combustion vehicles are listed on the EPA's Fuel Economy website with city, highway, and combined ratings. These ratings are derived from the city, highway, aggressive driving, hot weather, and freezing weather tests. FTP-75 is what the EPA calls the city test, which simulates stop-and-go urban driving with a cold start, idling, and an average speed of 21.2 mph (34.1 kph).

HWFET stands for highway testing, with the EPA simulating highway driving with no stops, an average speed of 48.3 mph (77.7 kph), a top speed of 60 mph (96.6 kph), and a warm start. US06 is the short way of saying aggressive driving test, which includes rapid acceleration and hard braking, sustained high-speed driving, and speeds no higher than 80 mph (128.7 kph). The aggressive driving test is also performed with a warm start.

Things get more interesting with SC03, namely the hot weather test with the AC running. Following the warm start, the test is performed at 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) with the AC on to increase engine load and fuel consumption. Lastly, the cold weather test is similar to the city test, but performed at 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius) with a warm engine.

Following these five cycles, the final MPG figures listed on the window sticker are calculated by weighing the results of said cycles to factor in a variety of inefficiencies. Highlight inefficiencies include the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, cold weather, and high speed. Considering the aforementioned, it's easy to understand why EPA figures are lower than WLTP figures.

Over in the electric vehicle space, the EPA's method for determining range and energy consumption involves driving battery-electric vehicles until their batteries are completely depleted. The EV-specific test is designed to be highly demanding, consequently ensuring conservative ratings. The first step of the multi-cycle test procedure is a full charge of the battery.

Said vehicle is then left overnight in a temperature-controlled environment, which is called the soak room. The ambient temperature ranges from 68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 30 degrees Celsius). The vehicle has to go through repeated city and highway test cycles on the dyno until the battery is discharged. The total distance accumulated during this test is the preliminary (unadjusted) range.

In the final phase of the multi-cycle test procedure, the vehicle is fully recharged using the standard charger, therefore allowing the EPA to calculate the energy efficiency in miles per gallon equivalent. The EPA uses a conversion factor of 33.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity as being equivalent to the energy yielded by a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline.

The fixed downward adjustment factor is 70 percent, and it accounts for a number of real-world factors that can't be simulated properly in the lab. From driving accessories to aggressive driving behavior, gradients, and cabin heating, this adjustment factor is multiplied by the preliminary driving range figure. This intentional 30 percent reduction gives prospective customers more attainable driving range estimates on a full charge.

Said factor is not used by the EPA to estimate the driving range of internal combustion vehicles. The estimated driving range of an internal combustion vehicle is derived from the combined MPG figure and the fuel tank capacity. The total internal combustion range has a particularity we have to talk about as well.

Simply put, the combined MPG figure is a weighted average of the adjusted city and highway miles-per-gallon estimates. The city-highway split used by the Environmental Protection Agency as of this writing is 55 percent city and 45 percent highway.

The China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle

Issued back in October 2019 and put into force in May 2020, national standard GB/T 38146.1-2019 defines the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle for all manufacturers who sell cars in the country that prides itself on almost 30 percent of global manufacturing output. Similar to Europe's WLTP, the CLTC replaces the far less realistic New European Driving Cycle.

Primarily developed by the China Automotive Technology & Research Center, which also has a European subsidiary, the CLTC acknowledges the significant differences between China's unique traffic environment and global testing standards. CATARC researchers collected a whole bunch of data from over 3,700 light-duty vehicles across 40 cities in China to construct the China-specific test cycle.

Typical driver behavior, traffic volume, and road conditions were considered in the development phase, but unsurprisingly, the CLTC puts an emphasis on the short trip analysis method. Otherwise said, the Chinese test cycle for passenger vehicles (CLTC-P) is split between a total of 11 short trips and 12 idle segments.

A rather curious methodology, indeed, but there is science behind it. The CLTC-P reflects the overly congested traffic in Chinese urban areas, which are defined by frequent acceleration, deceleration, prolonged idling periods, and lower average speeds. Performed over 30 minutes, the CLTC-P test cycle totals 14.48 kilometers (9.00 miles) at 28.96 kilometers per hour (18 miles per hour). Its maximum speed is 114 kph (71 mph).

A clear bias for urban driving environments, for sure, and the maximum speed of the test does not reflect the expressway limit of 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour). Adding insult to injury, the idle ratio is 22.11 percent of the CLTC-P test's 30 minutes. The CLTC-P is more favorable to battery-electric vehicles due to less aerodynamic drag and regenerative braking.

This explains why the CLTC for passenger vehicles yields higher estimate ranges than for the same vehicle under the WLTP and EPA protocols. Digging a little deeper, the CLTC-P test cycle is divided into three phases, of which the slow- and medium-speed phases are longer than the high-speed phase. How much longer? The answer is 674 and 693 seconds compared to 433 seconds.

The CLTC-P1 or slow-speed phase mimics heavy urban traffic, whereas the CLTC-P2 or medium-speed phase represents less congested urban driving with less frequent stops. Because its maximum speed is lower than the high-speed cycles found in the WLTP and EPA standards, the CLTC-P3 is the least realistic of the bunch. But similar to its Western counterparts, the cycles are run on a dynamometer in a controlled environment.

For electric vehicles, the CLTC-P is a charge-depleting test. Only relevant for Chinese motorists, the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle is excellent only for those who primarily drive in extremely congested urban areas. Due to its structure, the CLTC is often perceived by Westerners as having an optimism bias.

The China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle has also faced criticism for not fully accounting for heating, air conditioning, and other energy-draining equipment. As far as electric vehicles are concerned, every little bit counts, especially in extremely hot or cold weather. A fixed, non-driving load is included in CLTC-P testing, often simulated at 300 watts or thereabouts.

WLTP, EPA, and CLTC approximation formulas for EV range and ICE fuel economy ratings

Electric vehicles work differently from their internal combustion equivalents, which explains why the approximation formulas for EV range and ICE fuel economy ratings are different between the WLTP, EPA, and CLTC. At press time, the WLTP to EPA conversions for electric vehicle range are 10 to 15 percent (EPA = WLTP x 0.90 or 0.85). CLTC, meanwhile, offers 20 percent higher estimates (WLTP = CLTC x 0.80).

The CLTC to EPA conversion is the most dramatic, with estimates being around 30 percent lower than the Chinese Light-Duty Test Cycle numbers (EPA = CLTC x 0.70). Because the NEDC-replacing WLTP testing cycle is conducted under ideal conditions, either 0.90 or 0.80 factors are sometimes used to determine the real-world range (Real World = WLTP x 0.90 or 0.80).

Turning our attention to internal combustion vehicles, EPA testing includes a correction factor for air conditioning and aggressive driving. This means a vehicle consumes more fuel during the EPA test, which is why EPA consumption is about 10 to 20 percent higher than WLTP estimates (EPA = WLTP x 1.10 or 1.20).

CLTC fuel consumption figures are, generally speaking, 15 to 20 percent lower than WLTP numbers (CLTC = WLTP x 0.85 or 0.80). As for EPA to CLTC, make that an eye-watering 30 to 40 percent higher energy consumption (EPA = CLTC x 1.30 or 1.40).

To demonstrate these formulas, we'll pick an electric vehicle in the form of the Tesla Model Y with rear-wheel drive and the long-range battery. Said configuration of the world's most popular electric sport utility vehicle nets 357 miles (575 kilometers) in the United States, 386 miles (534 kilometers) in Europe, and 467 miles (751 kilometers) in China.

The WLTP rating is 8.2 percent higher than the EPA rating, and by extension, the CLTC rating is 30.6 percent higher than what you can squeeze out from the Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive Standard Range in the United States market. An internal combustion model sold in all three markets is the BMW 330i sedan, albeit the Chinese model does have a longer wheelbase.

Gifted with the B48 four-cylinder turbo and ZF's eight-speed automatic, the 330i drinks a combined 31 miles per gallon (7.6 liters per 100 kilometers) in the United States of America. The WLTP rating is 6.6 liters per 100 kilometers (35.6 miles per gallon), whereas the CLTC estimate is 6.1 l/100 km (38.6 mpg).

The WLTP rating is 13.2 percent better than the EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of the 2026 BMW 330i sedan. The 330Li for China is 19.7 percent more efficient, but only on paper because the CLTC is optimized for low-speed urban driving scenarios.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/wltp-vs-epa-vs-cltc-why-range-estimates-differ-and-which-is-the-most-realistic-261500_1.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 17:59:05.005856

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.","HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.

In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.

Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbondioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.

Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.

China's trucking fleet, the world's second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and ""in other countries, it might never take off,"" he said.

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle's lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

""When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,"" Doleman said.

Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.

Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

CATL, the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering about 93,000 miles out of China's about 114,000 miles of expressways.

The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.

Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

""The rise of China's electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,"" said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.

LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the covid-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground.

Shell's 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world's largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.

China's electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group.

But Doleman views LNG as a ""transitional step"" unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.

China is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer's fleet. This will make it ""almost impossible"" for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.

A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance.

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET

Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.

Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited.

China's hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted.

In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVs to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge.

China's Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others.

In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels.

Prices of zero-emission trucks in Europe must roughly halve to become affordable alternatives to diesel, according to another study in 2024 by McKinsey.

Volvo told The Associated Press that it didn't comment on competitors but welcomed ""competition on fair terms,"" while Scania did not respond.

A new system called K-flex allows the plant to build SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans on a single assembly line.

This flexible manufacturing line reduces the time and cost typically required to retool for new vehicle models.

Autonomous sleds ferry vehicle shells, sparks dart in every direction, and robotic arms as tall as basketball hoops install car windows.

Like an industrial symphony from another world, each process plays its part in the intricate choreography of Toyota’s largest manufacturing plant on Earth.

Located on a 1,300-acre plot of land 70 miles away from Louisville, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) represents the future of automotive production.

Toyota has 14 manufacturing plants all over the U.S. including in Indiana, Mississippi and Jackson, Tenn., where engine blocks and transmission cases and housings are produced. So far, TMMK is the only Toyota plant in the world to implement this new technology.

But as TMMK works to adapt its manufacturing capabilities, on Nov. 18 Toyota Motor announced it will invest more than $912 million to renovate its manufacturing sites across five states, including at TMMK and its Tennessee plant. A week before that announcement, Toyota said it's planning a $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina.

Meanwhile, at the plant responsible for more than 435,600 vehicles and 714,400 engines in 2024, the company is spending $1.8 billion to introduce a more flexible, technologically advanced manufacturing line poised to redefine efficiency and scale.

Historically, manufacturing assembly lines have strict size requirements limiting production, but at TMMK that's not the case. SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans can all be built on one line, by something called K-flex.

What is Toyota's new K-flex platform?

“A lot of people think that means Kentucky flexibility, but what it really means is actually K platform flexibility,” TMMK President Kerry Creech said.

A K platform, specific to Toyota, is a shared skeleton that includes the chassis, suspension and drivetrain for Toyota-produced vehicles like the Camry, RAV, Highlander, Sienna, Lexus RX and NX.

K-flex allows for the versatility of that shared skeleton across SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans all on one line.

While only one of its three manufacturing lines has full flexibility, Creech — who began his TMMK tenure in 1990 as a powertrain production team member — said as manufacturing demands evolve, flexibility is vital across the assembly line.

Roughly 35 years ago, “we could only build a sedan” on the line due to size restrictions, he said. At that time, the industry was producing about 80% sedans and 20% light trucks and SUVs. But “now that’s flipped,” Creech added.

To meet evolving consumer demand, Toyota is rolling out new vehicle models. But the conventional retooling process for electric and hybrid vehicles can be expensive and time-consuming, slowing production and straining output.

So the automaker had to rethink how it builds cars to stay competitive in a market shifting toward electrification and diverse vehicle types, Creech said.

“Whether it’s a plug-in hybrid or a total battery electric vehicle, we had to have that flexibility,"" Creech said.

Traditionally, as automakers gear up for the latest model, they invest heavily into modifying the manufacturing line to meet the dimensions of the next vehicle. With K-flex, that’s not the case.

“So we really reduce our production preparation lead time, as well as our capital expense, which kind of gives us an advantage at this facility compared to the traditional, because each time you introduce a new vehicle, then you may be changing some of the structure that’s in there,” Vice President of Manufacturing Chad Miller said, on the intricacies needed for different vehicles.

While K-flex allows for adjustability among many of its vehicles, it doesn't encompass everything. Some larger vehicles like SUVs and framed trucks are too big to be built on the flexible line.

In addition to K platform products, TMMK also produces 4-cylinder and V6 engines, hydrogen fuel cell kits, axles, steering components, machine blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts, rods and axle assemblies and dies.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/07/PNAS/86571792007-tmmk-025.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-23 16:01:22.754614

The Greens appear to be inching closer to a deal on updating the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, with the Coalition still refusing to back the changes.

Watt has offered concessions to both Greens and Coalition demands.","Years of debate about environmental law reform have come down to a tense standoff in the final sitting week of federal parliament for the year, with Labor claiming it can do a deal that will pass the Senate by Thursday.

The government is still pushing to pass its major changes, despite not yet having reached an agreement with either the Greens or the Coalition.

The Greens appear to be inching closer to a deal on updating the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, with the Coalition still refusing to back the changes. But the Minerals Council has joined other peak business groups in urging the Liberals and Nationals to back the changes, with the environment minister, Murray Watt, pledging to make a deal with whoever will come to the table first.

“We will pass these reforms this week with whichever of the Coalition and the Greens is willing to work with us to deliver that balanced package,” Watt said on Sunday.

Greens and Labor sources said they expected the two parties could come to an agreement later in the week, ahead of parliament rising on Thursday afternoon, but the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, wanted more limits on fossil fuel developments before signing up.

“We also want to make sure we’re not seeing coal and gas fossil fuel projects accelerated,” she told the ABC’s Insiders.

“I think it’s crazy in 2025, you’re talking about a new set of environment laws and it doesn’t even consider the climate pollution that a coal or gas mine makes.”

Despite the 1,500 pages of environmental law reform still being examined by a Senate committee, due to report in March 2026, the government says it wants to ram the bill through parliament by year’s end because it would improve approvals and build times for major parts of its agenda including housing construction, critical minerals sites and green energy projects.

But the Greens and Coalition say they are not convinced of the bill’s urgency. Despite not ruling out a deal later in the week, Greens sources said they didn’t see the need for rushing, noting the ongoing Senate inquiry, and their concerns that the bill could help fast-track approval of coal and gas projects.

Labor, in turn, is pressuring the Greens. Watt held a press conference on Sunday in the Brisbane electorate of Ryan, the last Greens-held seat in the country after the party lost three seats at the May election.

“We saw at the last federal election that the Greens party paid a very big political price for being seen by the Australian people to be blocking progress on important things like housing and environmental law reform,” Watt said.

“There’s a real opportunity for the Greens this week to demonstrate that they have heard the message from the Australian people, that they’re not going to keep blocking progress, that they’re not going to make the perfect the enemy of the good.”

The Liberal party’s finance spokesperson, James Paterson, said on Sunday: “Where it stands today, we certainly couldn’t support the proposed legislation.”

He claimed the laws were “deficient” and that the opposition would stick to its earlier demands, daring the government to “do a deal with the Greens and they will wear the consequences of that”.

Watt has offered concessions to both Greens and Coalition demands.

To the Coalition, Watt has conceded amendments to tighten rules around the National Environmental Protection Agency’s powers, while for the Greens, Labor has offered limits on the “national interest” test being used to approve fossil fuel projects.

On Sunday, Watt extended another olive branch to the Greens, offering to force native forestry projects to comply with national environmental standards within three years. But Hanson-Young wanted more for their support, saying a three-year phase-in was not fast enough.

“It’s 2025 and it’s time we ended native forest logging,” she said.

Corporate groups such as the Business Council of Australia have urged the Coalition to back the EPBC changes. The Minerals Council CEO, Tania Constable, added her voice on Sunday, calling for a “sensible compromise by both sides”.

“This will allow our industry to deliver investment, jobs and regional benefits faster,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f88623c859d21d5ea569701701c4300e9692a6/1296_0_6449_5163/master/6449.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd656022c27e66bf91d3d0ba5da80fef",N,,2025-11-23 16:01:01.785782

That would nearly double the current number of clean energy jobs — which stood at around 440,000 as of 2023 — and move the country closer to sustainable energy independence.

This objective aligned with the U.K.'s pledge to reach ""net zero,"" the point at which emissions are counterbalanced by those removed from the atmosphere, by 2050. The U.K.'s Clean Energy Jobs Plan outlined the country's plan to pursue ""homegrown renewables"" at an effectively low cost.

""Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition,"" Unite the Union said.

The government plans to establish five ""technical excellence colleges"" to train graduates for careers in plumbing, heating, ventilation, electricity, welding, and more in the clean energy sector.

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan also created initiatives to match underrepresented workers — including veterans, ex-offenders, school-leavers, and the unemployed — with opportunities in the clean energy industry.

By investing in broader clean energy infrastructure, the government can significantly lower consumer costs while reducing the air pollution that contributes to rising temperatures. For example, going solar can reduce household energy costs to near $0 while curbing pollution.

According to Ember Energy, clean energy will lower the average household's annual electric bills by £300 ($393) by 2030, saving the country £8.7 billion ($11.4 billion).

Store visited the Damlaagte and Ilikwa solar power plants in South Africa's Free State province on Friday. The plants were developed by Mainstream Renewable Power, in which Norway's Aker Horizons ASA is a major shareholder. According to the Norwegian government, the company has provided renewable energy to around 200,000 households, while the two plants Store visited together supply electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of roughly 120,000 households.

While progress in renewable energy deployment has been rapid, Store underscored the need for more investment and cooperation on solar power across the African continent.

""Some 600 million people on the African continent lack access to electricity. At the same time, Africa has an abundance of sunshine, which is a good source of renewable energy. I had the chance to see how Norwegian companies are helping to produce renewable energy. This solar energy plant is serving both to reduce emissions and create growth,"" Store said during the visit.

South Africa remains heavily dependent on coal, which accounts for about 85 percent of its power production. The Norwegian side sees solar projects such as Damlaagte and Ilikwa as examples of how foreign investment can both ease the country's energy crisis and contribute to its green transition.

""These solar power plants are an excellent example of how Norwegian investments are being used to advance the green transition across the world. Plants such as this also create new jobs,"" said the prime minister.

Instead, it wrapped up as a complex package—balancing new initiatives for implementation with the COP decision itself, and reflecting the mutirão spirit of compromise across diverse voices.

We came into COP30 knowing we are still falling short of our climate goals. Yet over these two weeks, we also saw real movement: beyond the formal outcome text, countries, communities, businesses, and civil society began pulling in the same direction.

The pavilions and dialogues revealed an axis of action—solutions we can deploy now and build on tomorrow. Global ambition still falls short, but the inspiration here was clear: the future depends on how quickly we turn ideas into implementation.

Ultimately, COP30 must be assessed in its entirety, not just through the lens of negotiations. For EDF, we measure success at COP30 through partnerships ignited, finance mobilized, and voices engaged.

From tropical forests to the food sector, air quality to adaptation, here are the bright spots that EDF is building on after Belém:

Financing for forests

In the Amazon, the link between forests, people and climate is immediate. That made progress on forest finance one of the most important signals from COP30.

The COP30 Presidency formally launched the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF) with an initial multibillion-dollar pledge from over 50 countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, Germany, and France. The goal is to provide long-term, reliable finance for countries that keep their tropical forests standing, with a dedicated share (20 percent) of funding for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.

EDF also helped launch the J-REDD+ Coalition, a new effort to help countries to bring high-integrity jurisdictional forest credits to market, and to ensure that the benefits reach the people who are keeping forests standing – from the Amazon to other critical forest regions around the world.

Finally, the COP30 Presidency announced that it plans to draft a roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation, to be presented this time next year. While this roadmap was not included in the formal COP decision, it nonetheless will have the potential to set out a pathway for timely and urgent actions.

Wildfire resilience

Belém also elevated one of the fastest-growing climate risks in forest regions: wildfire.

EDF and partners launched the Wildfire Action Accelerator Pledge, bringing together partners from 18 countries and regions have joined – such as Ecuador, Peru, Ghana, and Kenya – and more than 30 Indigenous and local community organizations. Its aim is to move from reacting to wildfires to preventing them, through community-centered approaches, stronger climate ambition and innovative finance for integrated fire management.

Brazil’s Call to Action on Integrated Fire Management and Wildfire Resilience, endorsed by 50 countries, reinforced that shift. Taken together, these efforts begin to build the global cooperation needed to keep forests – and the communities who depend on them – safer in a hotter, drier world.

Adaptation

Another clear signal from COP30 was the growing centrality of adaptation. Within the final COP30 negotiated outcome, Parties agreed to triple the support for developing countries to increase their resilience against climate change by 2035

But we need to scale adaptation solutions faster, as the impact of climate change are hitting communities and affecting economies today. Throughout the two weeks, EDF convened and joined events that framed adaptation not only as a moral imperative, but as an economic one – a way to reduce risk for municipalities, businesses and households while safeguarding lives and livelihoods. That framing ran through discussions, highlighting the need to move the market on adaptation and make resilience the common-sense economic choice.

Health and air quality

Short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane and black carbon, have outsized impacts on both warming and human health. New efforts including the Super Pollutant Country Action Accelerator and coordinated national plans to target black carbon demonstrate promising steps to reduce these pollutants, while also generating critical co-benefits like cleaner air and economic savings.

Renewed efforts to slash super-pollutants are critical to meet the Global Methane Pledge goal of a 30 percent methane reduction by 2030. Achieving this target could prevent 180,000 premature deaths annually.

EDF was proud to root our work on healthy air at COP30 in the Amazonian communities that hosted us. EDF’s new report, ‘Breathing Life into Amazonian Cities’ set out practical steps to cut air pollution in Brazil’s Amazon region and detailed the health and economic benefits of doing so. Partners used the report in Belém to show how cleaner air, public health and climate action reinforce one another.

The Belém Health Action Plan, backed by more than 80 countries, and the announcement of a Climate and Health Funders Coalition pledging hundreds of millions of dollars to climate-health initiatives, underlined the point: protecting people’s health is a powerful driver to cut pollution.

Global coordination on carbon markets

COP30 delivered an important step toward making climate policy more effective for fast action.

The Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets launched with an initial group of 18 countries. The coalition is designed as a platform for governments to learn from one another and build carbon markets that are more connected, more transparent and better aligned with real-world emissions cuts. Done well, the Coalition can pave the way for these compliance markets to align and collaborate unlocking innovation and investment to cut climate pollution around the world, while promoting cleaner and affordable development.

Sustainable agriculture

Agriculture is a leading driver of climate pollution – it accounts for 40 percent of annual global methane emissions from human-related activities.

In Belém, EDF and partners put forward a plan to scale up finance and increase practical solutions for methane mitigation in resilient agri-food systems. EDF also released a survey of insights from over 150 agricultural finance institutions, finding that most view climate risk as a financial risk that needs to be managed, and offer sustainability-related products and services to farmers.

From COP30 to 2030

COP30 in Belém wasn’t the breakthrough many hoped for, but it wasn’t a failure either. It revealed gaps in emissions, finance, and justice, even as communities worldwide already face the consequences of delayed action.

One key takeaway: mutirão—a Tupi-Guarani word for “community work”—must continue to guide us beyond COP30.

Receive each edition straight to your inbox by becoming a Critical Minerals Institute member—click here.","Apologies for the delay in this edition of the Critical Minerals Report (CMR); the past two weeks, from Saturday, November 8th through this morning — November 23rd, have been unusually intense with policy moves, strategic finance decisions, and market signals that all point in the same direction: critical minerals are now being treated as core national security infrastructure, not just commodities.

The most explicit statement of that came from Washington today. On November 23rd, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) signalled that it plans to deploy up to US$100 billion to secure U.S. and allied supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas. The bank’s chair described a pipeline of projects in Europe, Egypt and Pakistan and framed the move as a response to an “over-reliance” on suppliers whose terms are “no longer fair.” The important point for investors is not just the headline number, but the shift in EXIM’s role: from a transaction-support lender to a central instrument of mineral and energy security policy. It effectively adds a quasi-sovereign backstop to large-capex projects that might otherwise stall on funding or political-risk constraints.

That macro signal lands in the same week that a specific U.S.–Central Asia supply-chain play came into sharper focus. On November 10th, the U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan released a fact sheet describing an agreement under which U.S. firm Cove Capital LLC and the Government of Kazakhstan plan to build a tungsten mining and processing plant with roughly US$1.1 billion in U.S. financing. The project targets the Northern Katpar and Upper Kairakty deposits and is structured around a joint venture between Cove Capital LLC and Kazakhstan’s state mining company JSC Tau-Ken Samruk, with Cove holding a 70 % interest and Tau-Ken Samruk 30 %. Although the commercial joint-venture documentation dates from early November, the diplomatic framing over the past two weeks makes it clear this is being treated as a strategic tungsten reserve play aimed at diluting Chinese dominance in a metal that is central to armour-piercing munitions, drill bits, and high-temperature alloys.

Here are 2 interviews with Cove Capital’s Pini Althaus on the tungsten deal that Jack Lifton and I did on Wednesday:

November 21, 2025 – Jack Lifton with Cove Capital’s Pini Althaus on the Largest Tungsten Project in the World https://youtu.be/zs-zIcO6l6s

FYI: Market pricing is starting to reflect that renewed focus on tungsten. Chinese data show wolframite concentrate at about RMB 325,000 per tonne and ammonium paratungstate (APT) around RMB 482,000 per tonne as of November 19th, up sharply from levels seen earlier this year (Source).

Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom chose the same fortnight to formalise its own critical minerals strategy. This weekend (November 22-23rd), the government published a plan that targets 10% of domestic demand from U.K. production and 20% from recycling by 2035, and – more importantly – sets a hard ceiling so that no more than 60 % of any one critical mineral comes from a single foreign supplier (Source). The strategy is backed by up to £50 million in new funding and explicitly highlights lithium and tungsten assets in Cornwall, positioning them as European-scale resources for batteries and defence-grade alloys (Source). At present the U.K. sources only about 6% of its critical-mineral needs domestically, so the targets are ambitious and will require accelerated permitting, recycling build-out and midstream processing capacity, not just new mines.

In Brussels, the European Union spent the week of November 17-21 convening Raw Materials Week 2025, the annual gathering of policymakers, industry and financiers. This year’s programme, built around the theme “Choose Europe,” focused on implementation of the EU Critical Raw Materials Act and previewed a forthcoming “ResourceEU” platform, scheduled for announcement on December 3rd, which will act as a matchmaking and risk-sharing mechanism for raw-materials investments, storage and offtake (Source). One notable side-event on November 19th highlighted Canada–EU cooperation in raw materials, underscoring how Ottawa is positioning Canadian critical-mineral assets as part of a transatlantic security-of-supply architecture (Source). The direction of travel is clear: Europe is trying to solve its raw-materials exposure with institutional architecture – regulation, joint platforms and cross-border partnerships – rather than relying predominantly on national industrial strategies.

While policy makers were re-drawing the strategic map, capital markets were reminding participants that bottlenecks and policy risk can still dominate the narrative, even when they sit in relatively small corners of the periodic table. Recent volatility in niche rare earth products, including yttrium oxide, has been less about fundamentals and more about Chinese export licensing, U.S.–China tariff tensions, and the way thin markets amplify regulatory signals. The episode has been a useful stress test: it reinforced that supply-chain vulnerability is real, but also that not every price spike reflects a durable shift in underlying demand.

It is important, however, to separate signal from noise. Industry experts continue to push back on headlines that frame yttrium as an irreplaceable semiconductor input, noting that substitutes exist in many applications and that a large share of demand is outside the chip sector entirely. By contrast, more mainstream benchmarks such as neodymium and praseodymium-neodymium oxide have been comparatively stable in recent weeks, with modest firming rather than explosive moves. The capital markets takeaway is less about chasing spot moves and more about recognising where genuine structural tightness exists versus where liquidity and regulation are doing most of the work.

Lithium, in contrast, offered a clear reminder of how quickly regulatory action can whipsaw speculative positioning in a mainstream battery metal. On November 21st, the most-traded lithium carbonate contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange hit its daily limit down after a strong run-up, following exchange moves to raise transaction fees and tighten position limits for certain traders. At the same time, reports that Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) is preparing to restart the Jianxiawo lithium mine in Yichun, with meaningful incremental supply, added a fundamental reason for speculative length to come out of the market. The sequence underscored how exchange rules, not only supply-demand forecasts, can drive short-term price action in critical minerals futures.

Equity markets across the lithium value chain reflected that tension between long-term demand optimism and near-term volatility. On November 17th, Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) led the S&P 500 after commentary from a major competitor pointed to strong expected lithium demand growth in 2026, citing grid-scale storage and AI-driven data-centre loads as key drivers. The same session saw outsized percentage gains across several peers, including Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE: SQM; Santiago Stock Exchange: SQM-B, SQM-A), Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC | TSX: LAC), Lithium Argentina AG (NYSE: LAR | TSX: LAR), and Sigma Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ: SGML | TSXV: SGML). Since then, trading in these names has remained choppy: most have bounced off their lows, but they continue to trade at substantial discounts to 2022–2023 peaks, reflecting both uncertainty about the next leg of the price cycle and a more disciplined attitude toward growth assumptions.

Investor positioning is also responding to a growing perception that rare earths now offer more policy-backstopped upside than lithium. Reporting over the past week highlighted that Australian investor Gina Rinehart has been reducing positions in several lithium names, including Albemarle Corporation, Lithium Americas Corp., Lithium Argentina AG and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A., while significantly increasing her stake in MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP). MP Materials, a key U.S. producer of rare earth oxides that is developing downstream magnet capacity, has benefited from U.S. Department of Defense support and government-linked offtake frameworks. That rotation is a concrete example of capital following the perceived direction of government guarantees and long-term procurement, rather than simply tracking spot commodity moves.

Against this backdrop, broader commodity benchmarks have been relatively subdued but broadly supportive. As of November 21st, the S&P GSCI Copper Index was up roughly 24% year-to-date and the S&P GSCI North American Copper Index had gained about 25% year-to-date, while the headline S&P GSCI composite index was essentially flat over the prior month, with only marginal week-on-week movement. In other words, the sharper moves investors are observing in selected critical mineral equities are not part of a broad-based commodity super cycle, but are instead being driven by sector specific policy decisions, technology shifts and capital allocation themes (tracking government investments) rather than an across-the-board surge in critical mineral prices.

Taken together, the last two weeks show three converging trends. First, state-backed finance is scaling up: the EXIM commitment, the U.K.’s targeted funds and the EU’s forthcoming ResourceEU platform all point toward a more interventionist model in which public balance sheets are actively used to de-risk critical-mineral projects. Second, security-driven partnerships such as the Cove Capital LLC–Tau-Ken Samruk tungsten joint venture in Kazakhstan are becoming central tools of bilateral diplomacy, not just commercial ventures, with tungsten prices moving accordingly. Third, market microstructure – particularly in thinly traded or policy-sensitive materials like yttrium oxide and lithium futures – is increasingly where geopolitical risk is first reflected, often with price moves that far exceed underlying fundamental shifts.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-23 19:28:04+00:00,the Guardian,We delivered a clear message at Cop30: the delayers and defeatists are losing the climate fight,"Ed Miliband, www.theguardian.com, ed-miliband",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/23/cop30-ed-miliband-climate-change-brazil-conference-clean-energy,"We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life.
And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.
Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries.
The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt.
We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action.","Sweaty, maddening, sleepless. That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need to redouble our efforts to keep global warming to 1.5C.

We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just 1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.

We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.

It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitly pledged a roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.

Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressive coalition of 83 countries from the global north and global south, backed by more than 140 global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.

This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.

There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the US stepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.

Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goal is 1.5C for a reason – because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through the Belém Mission to 1.5 and Global Implementation Accelerator.

Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.

Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers an incredibly inspiring solution to global deforestation.

We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.

Thousands of British businesses were involved in these initiatives. Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.

The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope. For all its flaws, Cop has reaffirmed the belief of the vast majority of the world in this ideal. Those who would deny or prevent action are not winning the argument, they are losing.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69740a9d89bde0ff514cbcae015ec5c1aa1bf5e4/191_0_3450_2761/master/3450.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=07aa7d3f1e8a22499de2083f9e751a50",N,,2025-11-23 16:00:55.322849

In recent years, numerous countries have come together to sign the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050. This initiative has also gained the support of several financial institutions. Meanwhile, in the U.S., rising electricity demands are making nuclear energy a top priority.

Nuclear power is appealing because it's scalable, reliable, always-on, and zero-carbon. The nuclear buildout had stalled for several years, but things are turning around. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.S. is aiming to ""unleash American energy,"" and investing in nuclear energy is part of this plan.

This is where Oklo (OKLO +0.19%) seeks its opportunity. The nuclear power start-up has the backing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Not only that, but the current U.S. Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, is a former Oklo board member.

Oklo stock has surged, up 347% over the past year. But more recently, the stock has faced some selling pressure and is 52% below its all-time high from one month ago. With the stock well below $110 per share, is now a good time to buy? Let's dive into the business and its outlook to find out.

Oklo is developing advanced nuclear technology

Oklo develops advanced fission power plants known as Aurora powerhouses. It does not currently have a commercially operating business. Instead, it is working on research and development, obtaining Nuclear Regulatory Commission certifications, and securing more customers for its next-generation nuclear plant technology.

Its Aurora powerhouses utilize metal-fueled fast-reactor technology based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, which operated for 30 years at the Argonne National Laboratory until its shutdown in 1994.

Its powerhouses are initially designed to produce 15 MWe and 75 MWe, with plans to expand to 100 MWe and beyond. These reactors can run on recycled fuel, with the Aurora powerhouse designed to operate for over 10 years before refueling.

Oklo's long-term growth opportunity stems from surging power demand, particularly in AI, data infrastructure, electrification, and decarbonization, which it can meet with its modular, deployable nuclear plants. As Oklo scales, it hopes to capture a significant market share in the promising advanced reactor industry.

It is working closely with regulators to get the necessary approvals

Oklo was selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) for an advanced nuclear fuel line pilot program, which is designed to accelerate permitting, construction, and operations, creating a fast-track approach to licensing. Under the program, Oklo will build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities to ensure a domestic supply of advanced nuclear fuel.

These projects are intended to enable Oklo to build and operate facilities that directly support its powerhouse deployments and complement existing work at its Advanced Fuel Center and the Aurora INL fuel fabrication facility.

The goal of the Fuel Line Pilot Program is to create pathways for the faster deployment of advanced nuclear technology, streamline reviews, and leverage private investment alongside federal oversight. This initiative helps Oklo secure fuel for early powerhouses while strengthening U.S. manufacturing and fuel independence.

The U.S. NRC accepted Oklo's Principal Design Criteria (PDC) topical report for accelerated review. Once approved (expected for early 2026), this report can be referenced in future applications, reducing the need to re-review established material.

Watch its cash needs

It will take time for Oklo's Aurora powerhouse to come online. In September, it held a groundbreaking ceremony on the Aurora-Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site, marking the start of construction work for its first Aurora reactor. It expects its first commercial powerhouse to come online in 2028.

To fund its growth during this early, non-profitable stage, Oklo needs capital. Last month, it filed a $3.5 billion mixed securities shelf offering. A mixed shelf offering is a flexible SEC filing that lets a company issue different types of securities, such as common stock, preferred stock, debt, or warrants, up to a pre-approved total amount over time. This means Oklo isn't issuing shares right away, but it does give it the option to raise capital quickly when needed.

It will take significant capital to finance its capital-intensive own-and-operate model. If Oklo needs to continue tapping equity or debt markets, it could significantly dilute shareholders along the way.

Is Oklo stock a buy today?

Oklo has several hurdles ahead of it before its powerhouses become operational. It must still navigate regulatory requirements, build its first powerhouse, and secure firm customer agreements. If it can accomplish all of this and streamline the development of future powerhouses, Oklo could be a force in the nuclear power space.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F843799%2Fatomic-particle-for-nuclear-energy-getty.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-11-23 14:59:52.146522

Amazon has become the dominant force in the tech industry with investments that span the length and breadth of the world. Not only are they one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, but they also serve as a crucial investor in the US nuclear sector. Following the recent outage of Amazon’s substantial web services, it has become clear that the company needs to develop a more reliable service for the global tech sector.

Amazon has invested in a new plan for a 960 MW small modular nuclear facility in Washington state

The nuclear sector in the United States has big plans, as the nation aims to revive the sector to ensure safe and sustainable energy for a variety of sectors. Most importantly, the AI and tech boom in the United States has revealed the less-than-ideal energy market in the nation.

To boost clean energy production, Amazon has announced its plans to invest in the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility in Washington. The facility will be built by Energy Northwest with funding provided by Amazon and will consist of 12 modular reactors.

The small modular reactors will be supplied by X-energy, which was granted a substantial investment of $500 million from Amazon. The “modular nature” of the project means that it will require significantly less area than a traditional nuclear facility.

“X-energy’s advanced reactor design, the Xe-100, will be used in Amazon’s partnership with Energy Northwest to develop four SMRs in the first phase of Cascade, with an initial capacity of 320 MW and the option to expand to 12 units with a capacity of 960 MW.” – Statement from Amazon

The project is expected to begin construction by the end of the decade

Amazon has noted that the construction phase is set to begin by the end of 2030, with a targeted completion date of mid-2030s. Amazon has noted that the project will create over 1,000 jobs for locals during the construction phase and an additional 100 permanent positions once operational.

“X-energy and Amazon, along with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and Doosan Enerbility, also signed a strategic collaboration agreement in August to accelerate the deployment of new Xe-100 advanced nuclear reactors in the United States to meet increasing power demands by data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification.” – Press release by X-energy

As the US nuclear sector has seen a biblical revival that is unprecedented in modern society, Indiana has been selected for a new advanced small modular reactor energy park that will rival the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility in Washington, marking the triumphant return of nuclear power in the United States.

“This project isn’t just about new technology; it’s about creating a reliable source of carbon-free energy that will support our growing digital world. I’m excited about the potential of SMRs and the positive impact they will have on both the environment and local communities.” – Kara Hurst, Amazon’s chief sustainability officer

The eventual goal was to lower energy costs and create local job opportunities in the industry — meaning more affordable and accessible solar energy.
Other renewable energy funding eliminated or halted left numerous programs without funding.
Experts point out that the administration’s move against solar and renewable energy is contrary to market demands.","The state was to get $400 million for solar energy in disadvantaged communities. The Trump administration took it all back.

By Elena Bruess for Capital & Main

In early July, when most Americans were celebrating Independence Day, Bret Biggart was making plans to keep his Texas-based solar energy company from going dark. The Trump administration had just adopted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which fundamentally altered tax and spending policies in the United States, including phasing out federal tax credits for clean energy.

Biggart, who has worked in the solar industry for over two decades, was alarmed. Just a few years ago, the Biden administration had done the opposite by raising solar tax credits to 30% for homeowners and businesses — increasing interest, accessibility and market for solar energy. But now, Biggart prepared for that momentum to plunge in 2026.

“A lot of people are trying to install solar right now, because once you roll into January you won’t get the credit,” said Biggart, CEO of Freedom Solar Power, a residential solar installation company based in Austin. “I would say once that credit is gone, the solar market is going to go down by 30% to 40%.”

Solar energy has been on the rise in Texas for decades, but a dramatic shift in renewable federal policy and funding has left the industry unstable and industry actors like Biggart uncertain of the future. As a consequence, incentives that made solar energy installation and employment attractive, accessible and affordable have vaporized across the state — throwing a wrench in the growing market.

Before Donald Trump took office a second time, the Biden administration increased the renewable energy tax credit from 20% to 30%, and created Solar for All — a $7 billion federal fund designed to expand solar energy access to disadvantaged communities across the country through the administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

However, in an effort to halt the growth of renewable energy in favor of the oil and gas industry, the Trump administration is phasing out the tax credit by January 2026 and eliminating Solar for All — stripping recipients of any initially awarded funds. This includes nearly $250 million for California, $156 million for Pennsylvania and $400 million for Texas.

Experts, officials and businesses across the country have sounded alarm bells over the impact these funding and policy changes will have on the solar industry. In Texas, Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee sued the Trump administration and Environmental Protection Agency in October, arguing that the administration’s decision to claw back the money is unlawful. In the meantime, the funding remains frozen. As for the loss of tax credits, solar companies like Biggart’s are in a kind of purgatory, fighting to stay afloat for the foreseeable future.

“We have more projects than we can literally fill a schedule, and we’re hiring like crazy and trying to get these projects done,” Biggart said. “But there’s this cliff and how far is the cliff, and how gnarly it is, is sort of to be determined.”

Accessible Solar

Despite being home to one of the largest petrochemical industries in the world, Texas has a large and growing renewable energy market.

The state is third in solar jobs behind California and Florida, and employment in the solar industry has increased by nearly 30% between 2018 and 2023, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. And, recent reporting by the United States Energy Information Administration found that in Texas, utility-scale solar — which is solar energy sold directly to the state electrical grid — generated 50% more energy within the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024, and nearly four times more than in the same period in 2021.

However, the state is not as far along when it comes to nonutility-scale residential installation and community solar programs, according to Margaret Cook, vice president of water and community resilience at the Houston Advanced Research Center, a nonprofit focused on sustainable development and science.

“We have little problems in Texas getting those large [utility-scale] installations and the jobs associated with that,” Cook said. “Our single family, multifamily, our commercial and residential solar industries are not as robust and they are seeing a lot of turnover, downsizing of companies.”

Solar for All was meant to help close that gap by expanding energy access to low-income and disadvantaged communities across Texas through various partnerships and programs. The eventual goal was to lower energy costs and create local job opportunities in the industry — meaning more affordable and accessible solar energy.

With the federal program in place, solar companies prepared for a huge influx of work by hiring more people to get ready for the expected increase in business. Now, Cook said those are sunk costs since none of the companies will be receiving the grant money they were promised.

And it wasn’t just Solar for All. Other renewable energy funding eliminated or halted left numerous programs without funding.

The Black United Fund of Texas — a nonprofit housed in Houston’s historic Fifth Ward — had expected millions in funding from the federal government for a local solar installation training program through several EPA environmental justice and resiliency grants. The organization had already hired instructors and started its first class. But all the funds it initially received have been frozen or eliminated, and the organization had to search for new funding.

“Trust is a big thing in low-income communities because everyone comes in promising so many things, and usually they don’t see anything directly change or impact them,” said Velika Thomas, chief financial officer for the Black United Fund.

Some of the students were able to graduate from the first class, but weren’t able to continue to the next phases, said Thomas. Those students got jobs at a local solar installation company, but the organization is still searching for more funding for future students.

The same type of whiplash left companies like Biggart’s pivoting on the spot after the tax credit ended. Originally, Biggart could breathe a sigh of relief. The 30% credit the Biden administration adopted would last 10 years, until 2032. It meant he could plan how the market would look for the next several years. But after July, all that planning and relief went out the window.

Freedom Solar is now rebranding as Freedom Power, Biggart said. The company launched a heating, ventilation and air conditioning installation business and a generator business in addition to the solar installation and battery business. Two years ago, Freedom Solar had 1,000 employees. This year, it has 400.

“It’s sort of like riding a bull a little bit,” Biggart said. “There are a lot of ups and downs in the solar industry.”

Bringing Solar Back

Before the Trump administration cut funds, Harris County — a leader in Solar for All in Texas — was planning for 4,300 projects across Texas that would aid 30,000 low-income households through the initiative, according to the Office of County Attorney Menefee. He sued the Trump administration and the EPA in October.

Initially, when the Big Beautiful Bill passed in early July, the administration repealed only the unobligated funds — the funds that had not yet been distributed. This came to only $19 million out of the total $7 billion allocation and wasn’t deemed a massive concern, said Menefee.

“But then in August this year, the EPA administrator announced that Solar for All, all $7 billion, would be eliminated,” Menefee said. “So that’s when we started getting ready to take action, which is what led to the lawsuit.”

In an August statement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or to access the appropriated funds to “keep this boondoggle alive.”

Menefee disagrees. The Constitution and the laws of this country don’t allow a president to unilaterally eliminate a program that was appropriated by Congress and for which the funds have been fully obligated, he said. And Texas isn’t the only state taking action: nearly two dozen other states have also sued the Trump administration over Solar for All.

Experts point out that the administration’s move against solar and renewable energy is contrary to market demands. Solar is still on the rise in Texas, especially for the large utility-scale companies, said Cook, the vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center.

Energy prices across Texas are also increasing, widening the gap that already exists between those who can afford electricity and those who struggle to pay the bills. For years, renewable energy, like solar, has been a growing solution to this concern since solar has proven to be more cost effective than traditional energy in the long term — at least for those who can pay the upfront installation cost.

In this new economy, the administration isn’t limiting access for everyone in the same way, said Cook. Solar is moving forward, but it’s leaving people behind at the same time.

“Texas has a lot of sun, a lot of land. It makes a lot of sense to do a utility-scale project in [the state]. It’s just very economically advantageous,” Cook said. “But Solar for All is for people to access what they might never have had access to without this program.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1500530/story_image/AP25282669678087.jpg?1763664981,N,,2025-11-23 14:59:44.865239

It’s easy to think compliance is there to slow you down, to make business harder.
There’s no headline that says, “Shipment Arrives Safely.” No TV cameras waiting outside a warehouse because every battery was documented correctly.
The victories in compliance are invisible, and that’s why they’re so easy to undervalue.
They’re deliberate habits that turn compliance from a reactive task into a built-in strength.","If you handle, store or ship hazardous materials, you’re operating with almost no margin for error. That margin seems to vanish during peak season when volumes surge and shortcuts slip in. There’s already a fallout. Cargo fires tied to undeclared or mislabeled dangerous goods are climbing in maritime shipping, pushing carriers to turn to AI for detection. Aviation regulators keep logging lithium battery smoke and fire events. These aren't isolated incidents, but why do they keep happening?

On the surface, the reasons seem obvious: mislabeling, sloppy storage, and missing documentation. Nevertheless, this negligence leads to full-blown emergencies that significantly threaten public safety.

What compliance really means

Hazard compliance is often seen as dull or boring, nothing more than printing the right label. Just another round of hoops to jump through because some regulator said so. It’s easy to think compliance is there to slow you down, to make business harder. And the hardest part is this: you rarely see the disasters you prevent. There’s no headline that says, “Shipment Arrives Safely.” No TV cameras waiting outside a warehouse because every battery was documented correctly. The victories in compliance are invisible, and that’s why they’re so easy to undervalue. But invisible doesn’t mean unimportant. It means you only notice when it’s too late.

The truth is brutal. Every label, every form, every rule is there to protect people. The worker stacking pallets in your warehouse, the flight crew cruising at 30,000 feet, the crew hundreds of miles at sea with a ship full of containers. Compliance is what keeps your products from turning into poison in a customer’s hands.

Lithium batteries have become the clearest test. They look ordinary, but one mislabeled package can turn a routine shipment into an inferno. The difference between a safe shipment and a disaster can come down to whether your team knows one UN number from another. Standards groups like NFPA have already added new fire-prevention guidance, which is best viewed as a starting line. Not the finish line.

How companies keep getting it wrong

The most damaging mistakes are often the simplest. Everyday goods, toys, vapes, cosmetics, cleaners, etc., get shipped as if they’re harmless when they’re anything but. Safety data sheets disappear, leaving employees to guess. Packages are repacked or relabeled without the paperwork ever catching up. Training gets watered down or skipped altogether, especially when temporary workers are thrown into chaos during the holidays.

On paper, none of this sounds dramatic. Yet these are the sparks that light the fires, trigger the fines and destroy customer trust.

Building resilience into compliance

So, what does success look like? It’s not about heroics, it’s about discipline. Companies that get this right maintain live inventories that map every SKU to the correct classification. They refuse to move products without complete documentation. They embed compliance checks into their systems, so rules aren’t left to memory or luck. They make training continuous, role-specific, and designed for real-world pressure, not just for passing a test.

And they build strong relationships with local fire departments so that when the worst-case scenario happens, first responders already know what they’re walking into. These aren’t expensive programs. They’re deliberate habits that turn compliance from a reactive task into a built-in strength.

Why it matters now more than ever

The stakes are high on three levels.

1. There’re risk and cost. Fires destroy inventory and shut down operations, but the reputational fallout can be worse. No company wants to see its name tied to a community evacuation or environmental disaster.

2. There’s continuity. Carriers tighten capacity after headline-grabbing incidents. Shippers with a clean record and complete documentation keep moving while others get left behind.

3. There’s customer trust. Consumers expect speed, but never at the expense of safety. They won’t forgive brands that cut corners and put people at risk.

The bottom line

Hazard compliance isn’t about boxes, labels, or checklists. It’s about the people who trust you to get it right. The worker who goes home safe at the end of their shift. The pilot who doesn’t have to fight smoke at 30,000 feet. The family who doesn’t wake up to sirens and evacuation orders because someone thought a shortcut was good enough.

Every time you treat compliance like a nuisance, you’re playing roulette with lives. And when the wheel stops, it won’t just be your product in flames.

This industry doesn’t need more companies checking boxes. It needs leaders with the guts to say: safety isn’t optional, it’s who we are. Because in the end, you can rebuild a warehouse, you can repair a balance sheet, but you cannot undo the damage when a preventable fire steals someone’s life.

That’s what’s at stake. Not paperwork. Not process. People. Always people.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/nattawit-adobestock-1323129602.zqTBKs7yfw.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-23 16:01:05.867926

This includes a pledge made by President Von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, of over €10 billion, as well as significant additional bilateral contributions by European financial institutions, member states, and their Development Finance Institutions, and estimated private investment mobilised.

This follows a year-long campaign to mobilise investments in renewable energy in Africa, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The campaign, organised in collaboration with the international advocacy organization Global Citizen and with the policy support of the International Energy Agency, was aimed at driving public and private investment in supporting the clean energy transition in Africa, expanding access to electricity, and promoting Africa’s sustainable economic growth and decarbonised industrialisation.

Speaking on the fund, President von der Leyen said, “Today, the world has stepped up for Africa. With €15.5 billion, we are turbocharging Africa’s clean-energy transition. Millions more people could gain access to electricity, real, life-changing power for families, for businesses, for entire communities. This investment is a surge of opportunity: thriving markets, new jobs, and reliable, clean energy that meets the needs of partners across the globe. President Ramaphosa and I both look forward to a clean-energy future for the continent. A future led by Africa, with strong support from its friend and partner, Europe.”

The Team Europe package announced by President von der Leyen includes new Global Gateway projects co-financed with contributions from Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain, as well as the European Investment Bank (€2.1 billion) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (€740 million). In addition, Italy (€2.4 billion), Germany (over €2 billion), the Netherlands including FMO (€250 million), Portugal (€113 million), Denmark (€81 million), Sweden (€44 million), Austria (€5 million), Ireland (€5 million) made bilateral contributions, worth over €5 billion, while the EBRD announced a separate bilateral investment of over €600 million.

In the context of the campaign, the African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20% of the African Development Fund’s 17th replenishment to renewable energy. Norway pledged approximately €53 million through its contribution to the African Development Fund over 2026-2028.

The campaign also secured additional commitments that will generate 26.8 GW generated renewable energy and bring renewable electricity to 17.5 million households that currently live without reliable access.

From the €10 billion pledged by President von der Leyen on behalf of Team Europe, €3.1 billion were announced previously on the occasion of the EU-South Africa summit in March 2025, the Mattei Plan for Africa and Global Gateway event in June 2025, the Africa Climate Summit and the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025 and the Global Gateway Forum in October 2025, while €7 billion were announced by the President during the final pledging event in Johannesburg on 21 November.

A list of projects included in today’s announcement is available online.

In addition to the campaign pledges, a number of Team Europe actors have indicated their intention to increase investments in renewable energy by 2030. This amounts to another €4 billion.

The ‘Scaling up Renewables in Africa’ campaign was launched in November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. It aimed to drive new commitments on policy and finance from governments, financial institutions, the private sector, and philanthropists. The campaign also created momentum more broadly towards the ambitious targets of tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency worldwide, set at COP28.

Currently, 600 million people still lack access to electricity in Africa. With Africa’s population set to double by 2050, providing affordable, sustainable energy is crucial for both the continent’s development and global climate goals. Africa holds 60% of the world’s best solar resources, offering a significant opportunity for renewable energy.

Despite this, the continent attracts only 2% of global energy investment and faces challenges like high capital costs, limited investment, geographic barriers, and supply chain constraints.

Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, and in particular through the Africa-Europe Green Energy Initiative (AEGEI), the European Union is working with African partners to seize this opportunity.

Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term to reverse Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts.
This is the entire California coast, every inch of Alaska, even the eastern Gulf of Mexico,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman.","The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including Southern California and off the coast of Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.

Since taking office for a second time in January, Trump has systematically reversed former President Joe Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market. Trump, who recently called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.

The drilling proposal drew bipartisan pushback in Florida, where a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Trump administration should reconsider and Republican Sen. Rick Scott said the state’s coasts “must remain off the table for oil drilling.” California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent Trump critic, called the administration’s plan “idiotic.”

Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.

Plans to allow drilling off California, Alaska and Florida’s coast

The administration’s plan proposes six offshore lease sales between 2027 and 2030 in areas along the California coast.

It also calls for new drilling off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico at least 100 miles from shore. Drilling leases would be sold in the newly designated South-Central Gulf region, adjacent to the central Gulf’s thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.

The new designation distinguishes the targeted area from the Eastern Gulf where drilling is prohibited under a moratorium Trump signed in his first term. Industry representatives said the change was aimed at addressing concerns from Florida officials who oppose drilling near their tourism-friendly coasts.

The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing the sales that it would take years for the oil from new leases to get to market.

“By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come,” Burgum said in a statement.

The American Petroleum Institute called the new plan a “historic step” toward unleashing more offshore resources. Industry groups point to California’s history as an oil-producing state and say it already has infrastructure to support more production.

Opposition from California and Florida

Scott, a Trump ally, helped persuade officials in Trump’s first term to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when Scott was governor. Scott and Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody introduced legislation this month to maintain the drilling moratorium from Trump’s first term.

Newsom, who often touts the state’s status as a global climate leader, said in response to Thursday’s announcement that California would “use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.”

California has been a leader in restricting offshore drilling since an infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill helped spark the modern environmental movement. While no new federal leases have been offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.

Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.

A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production.

Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term to reverse Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden’s order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.

Environmental and economic concerns over oil spills

Lawmakers from California and Florida warned new offshore drilling would hurt coastal economies, jeopardize national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put the health and safety of millions of people at risk.

“This is not just a little bit offshore drilling. This is the entire California coast, every inch of Alaska, even the eastern Gulf of Mexico,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman. “Basically, everywhere Big Oil has been salivating to drill for decades.”

Rep. Jimmy Patronis of Florida led a group of Republican lawmakers who asked Trump in a Thursday letter to withdraw some parcels off the Florida coast from leasing. They warned that oil exploration could interfere with a training area for nearby military airbases. Allowing the parcels to go forward “would have a chilling effect on the military’s ability to test new munitions, including hypersonic and counter drone weaponry,” they wrote.

The state is also still recovering from the environmental and economic havoc caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, which fouled coasts across the Gulf, said Florida Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor.

A Santa Barbara group, the Environmental Defense Center, formed in response to the 1969 California spill, said the plan puts at risk the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California, an important feeding ground for endangered blue, humpback, and fin whales.

“There is no way to drill for oil without causing devastating impacts,” said Maggie Hall, deputy chief counsel at the advocacy group. “The risk is unacceptable.”

If you live in one of the more wintry states, ’tis the season to race and put on your winter tires before the next heavy snowfall drops. For electric vehicle (EV) drivers, tires aren’t the only thing that need sorting out before winter really hits.

As InsideEVs noted, battery-powered cars have an edge over internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles when it comes to tire traction. However, there are things specific to EVs that owners should be aware of, especially when colder temperatures take over.

Here are five things every EV driver needs to do with their ride before winter hits.

1. Get a Battery Check

EV battery performance and range are reduced in cold weather, so if you anticipate freezing temperatures, plan on losing range. According to Car and Driver, “It’s not a massive decline, but some owners report 10 to 20 percent lower range at temperatures below freezing, and generally the colder it gets the more your EV’s range will be reduced.”

If your car has diagnostics, get the condition of your battery examined. Make plans for a reduced winter range if you know your battery is deteriorating.

2. Practice Preconditioning

Using your car’s timer system or the manufacturer’s app, the preconditioning feature warms the battery and cabin while your EV is still connected to the charger.

Not only will preconditioning improve your car’s range and preserve your battery’s life by using grid power, but it’ll give you a more convenient and comfortable ride right from the start, according to SlashGear.

3. Buy Winter Tires

Like gas vehicles, EVs really benefit from specialized winter tires in snowy or icy weather because an EV’s quick torque can make their tires more prone to wheel spin on slick conditions and EVs are generally heavier than ICE cars, according to EV Magazine.

There are specific tires made for EVs that are designed for low rolling resistance, but any regular performance-oriented snow tires should suit any EV adequately.

4. Use Your EV’s Heated Features

Like regular cars, EVs behave worse in winter for several reasons. However, an EV’s performance and range are dependent on its battery’s health, and heating up the cabin before driving in winter eats energy quickly. Luckily, a couple of your vehicle’s heated features will serve you well in cold conditions.

According to Kelley Blue Book, you should “consider using the EV’s heated seats and heated steering wheel instead of heating the entire cabin. These features use significantly less energy than the car’s climate control, which can affect how quickly the battery drains.”

5. Plan Ahead

Winter is the cruelest season for drivers, and its extreme temperatures and weather affect your car more than you think. Vehicles need extra patience and kindness in winter, and EVs are no exception. Park inside if you can, allow extra time for charging and do it more frequently when it’s cold.

India continues to benefit from the discounted prices that Moscow is offering to counter the ongoing international sanctions on Russian energy products.
Meanwhile, last week, Trump threatened to introduce tariffs of up to 500 percent on countries that continue to buy Russian energy.
The move is expected to encourage President Trump to reduce U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to help restore trade relations.
However, this may depend on whether India is willing to cut energy trade ties with Russia.","India has agreed to deepen its energy trade with the United States in a bid to avoid the introduction of higher tariffs on exports by President Donald Trump. In recent months, Trump has threatened several countries with tariffs if they do not import larger quantities of U.S. gas, to varying success. India, like several other Asian countries, has decided that agreeing to increase imports is the best way to help avoid its economy being hit hard by restrictions on trade with the U.S.

This week, India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, announced that a deal had been made for the U.S. to supply almost 10 percent of India’s liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports. The agreement was made to decrease the trade surplus between India and the U.S. The two powers have agreed to a one-year deal to import roughly 2.2 million tonnes a year of LPG from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The LPG purchase price will be based on the Mount Belvieu benchmark.

On the X social media site, Puri said, “A historic first! One of the largest and the world’s fastest-growing LPG market opens up to the United States. In our endeavour to provide secure affordable supplies of LPG to the people of India, we have been diversifying our LPG sourcing.” This marks the “first structured contract of U.S. LPG for the Indian market”, according to Puri.

India’s LPG demand has increased by 74 percent over the last decade, supported by both higher incomes and Prime Minister Modi’s Ujjwala program, which provides subsidised cooking gas to low-income households.

India sources most of its LPG from the Middle East at present, primarily from Qatar (27 percent), the UAE (26 percent), and Saudi Arabia (19 percent). The deal suggests that the Southeast Asian country may now be looking to diversify its energy sources following disruptions in the Red Sea, as well as OPEC+ cuts. At present, India imports between 20 to 21 million tonnes of LPG a year. If the U.S. provides 10 percent of its LPG supply, this could equate to around $1 billion in imports. Meanwhile, India’s trade surplus with the U.S. stands at around $40 billion.

In August, the Trump administration announced it would be imposing a 50 percent tariff on Indian goods to address trade imbalances and encourage India to halt the import of Russian oil. While the tariffs have negatively affected the U.S.-Indian partnership, India has yet to reduce its imports of Russian crude. India continues to benefit from the discounted prices that Moscow is offering to counter the ongoing international sanctions on Russian energy products. In 2024, India bought $52.7 billion of Russian crude, contributing around 37 percent of its oil bill.

Meanwhile, last week, Trump threatened to introduce tariffs of up to 500 percent on countries that continue to buy Russian energy. “The Republicans are putting in legislation that is very tough, sanctioning, etcetera, on any country doing business with Russia,” Trump told reporters. As well as India, the tariffs could hit China hard as it continues to purchase significant quantities of Russian oil.

Following the agreement to purchase more U.S. LPG, Trump said he plans to remove the 25 percent tariffs imposed on India for importing Russian oil in November, while the 25 percent reciprocal tariffs will remain in place through 2026. The LPG deal is part of a larger bilateral trade agreement between the two countries. Trump recently stated that the two powers were “pretty close” to a “fair trade deal”.

In October, following the agreement, India’s exports to the U.S. increased for the first time in five months, rising by 14.5 percent from September. Chevron, Phillips 66, and TotalEnergies are expected to transport the LPG to India in 48 tankers starting in January. The state-run oil majors, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), will manage the supplies once on Indian soil.

In the long term, India hopes to diversify its energy sources in a bid to decarbonise and boost its energy security. At present, India is the third-largest carbon dioxide emitter worldwide, after China and the U.S.

India’s energy demand is set to double from current levels by 2045 as the economy continues to grow, yet the government has introduced a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2070. To achieve this, India will have to diversify its energy sources and significantly increase its renewable energy capacity, as outlined in the national roadmap for energy transition.

India’s new energy agreement will see it import more LPG from the United States over the next year, with the possibility of extension. The move is expected to encourage President Trump to reduce U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to help restore trade relations. However, this may depend on whether India is willing to cut energy trade ties with Russia.

Ohioans are seeing increased energy costs for two primary reasons: generation costs and transmission costs.
In Ohio, utilities like AEP Ohio are legally prohibited from building new generation sources.
If customers are struggling with their electric bills, AEP Ohio can help.
She makes like $50 more, too much to qualify for the assistance programs,” Orban said.","OHIO — The holidays are around the corner with Christmas songs on radio and movies decorated in red and green shiny colors, and while it’s a joyous time for many people, for others the holidays may be jarring.

Julia Orban is a community advocate who said, this holiday season, there’s a problem brewing.

“People are really struggling right now. I work with a lot of families that are having to choose between whether or not they pay their rent or their utilities or food for their kids,” Orban said. “There’s a woman who was on oxygen, she requires, to live and she had her power turned off.”

Orban said that woman couldn’t afford to pay her electric bill, and she’s not the only one.

“It’s been an unprecedented amount of people coming to me with disconnect notices really struggling,” Orban said. “And I’ve been trying to help them get connected to assistance, but a lot of the assistance programs that were out for different things are starting to go away.”

In the meantime, there’s another threat to higher bills lurking around the corner.

The American Electric Power or AEP has filed a request with the state to increase its distribution base rates.

The company told Spectrum News 1 they would not provide an interview but they sent a statement as a response to the story.

“AEP Ohio has requested the PUCO approve a 2.14% increase in distribution base rates,” according to AEP Ohio Media Relations. “Those rates cover the costs of equipment like power poles, lines and transformers, and pay the salaries of the line workers who restore power after storms and other outages and of those people who manage the electric grid to keep the lights on. AEP Ohio’s distribution rates have been essentially flat for the last 10 years — distribution rates like the one before the commission now are not the reason energy costs have been increasing for our customers. If this rate increase is approved, an average customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month would see their monthly bill increase by $3.95.”

Morgan Harper is the co-founder of grassroots organization Columbus Stand Up, and she said they’re fighting back.

They have a petition and are knocking on doors asking people to attend the public hearing to testify against the increase.

“So, we launched a campaign called lights out on AEP to prevent the public utilities commission of Ohio from allowing AEP to raise electricity prices,” Harper said. “Even for people who are making decent money, they’re noticing that their price, their bills are getting up to $600, $700 a month they’re like, ‘I don’t know that I can continue to take this.”

Harper said there's also another concern regarding the request for the increase.

“Look at the public utilities commission of Ohio staff report,” Harper said. “They’re also asking for more money to be able to improve the fitness center and the executive compensation retirement packages.”

AEP Media Relations explained how customers get billed within their statement:

“AEP Ohio customers’ bills are made up of three parts: generation, transmission and distribution. Ohioans are seeing increased energy costs for two primary reasons: generation costs and transmission costs. Generation costs are those that cover electricity generation to meet a person’s energy needs — the power plants, wind farms and other generation sources that provide electricity to the system. Transmission costs are the costs of building and maintaining high-voltage lines that move energy over large distances, from generation sources to communities. Simply put, there is not enough electricity being generated in Ohio to meet our state’s electricity needs, creating an imbalance in the supply of energy and the demand for it. That imbalance is now forcing Ohio to import electricity from other states through high-voltage transmission lines. As generation supply has decreased, both generation and transmission costs have increased. AEP Ohio shares our customers’ concerns about the imbalance between the supply of energy and demand for it, and we are frustrated, too. In Ohio, utilities like AEP Ohio are legally prohibited from building new generation sources. We sincerely hope the market will respond soon with additional generation sources in Ohio to help alleviate this burden for our customers.”

“We serve Ohioans in 61 counties, and we care about them and their communities — we live in these communities, too. If customers are struggling with their electric bills, AEP Ohio can help. We offer programs to spread out the costs of electricity over multiple months, which can help families budget, and we can connect customers with programs that cover parts of their electric bill, depending on their income. Our energy dashboard can help customers understand how much energy they are using, and find ways to use less energy, which can help them save money. Customers can learn more about those programs or log in to view their personalized dashboard at AEPOhio.com/Savings/Home, or they can call us at 800-672-2231 for more information.""

“Finally, we wanted to mention that we know energy bills can be complicated, and we hope to clarify those for our customers by providing more transparent and easier to understand information on bills. We have started sending weekly emails to customers to help them track their electricity usage, and we have filed a separate request with the PUCO to create a more transparent and easy-to-understand bill. We hope that request will be approved to help our customers better understand their bills.”

But Orban said the assistance programs that are meant to help are often really hard to get.

And while the holidays are supposed to be a time of hope, Orban said her hope is for the state to hear their testimonies at public hearings, starting on Dec. 3

“There was a woman that I was just working with a couple weeks ago, she’s a single mom, she has a five-year-old son, she’s fighting breast cancer and works full time at a school. She makes like $50 more, too much to qualify for the assistance programs,” Orban said. “I’m planning and just sharing just how hard it is for people right now.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/web_photo_harper,N,,2025-11-23 12:00:56.435353

Here are five things every EV driver needs to do with their ride before winter hits.

1. Get a Battery Check

EV battery performance and range are reduced in cold weather, so if you anticipate freezing temperatures, plan on losing range. According to Car and Driver, “It’s not a massive decline, but some owners report 10 to 20 percent lower range at temperatures below freezing, and generally the colder it gets the more your EV’s range will be reduced.”

If your car has diagnostics, get the condition of your battery examined. Make plans for a reduced winter range if you know your battery is deteriorating.

2. Practice Preconditioning

Using your car’s timer system or the manufacturer’s app, the preconditioning feature warms the battery and cabin while your EV is still connected to the charger.

Not only will preconditioning improve your car’s range and preserve your battery’s life by using grid power, but it’ll give you a more convenient and comfortable ride right from the start, according to SlashGear.

3. Buy Winter Tires

Like gas vehicles, EVs really benefit from specialized winter tires in snowy or icy weather because an EV’s quick torque can make their tires more prone to wheel spin on slick conditions and EVs are generally heavier than ICE cars, according to EV Magazine.

Additionally, Car and Driver suggested that you keep your EV a bit more charged in winter than you normally would during other times of the year. “Most miles covered by today’s EV drivers come from overnight home charging, meaning many EVs can start every day with a fully charged battery,” it said.

Today’s announcement marks the second approval of a PFAS pesticide since Trump took office, with the first approval coming just two weeks before.

Following pressure from the pesticide industry, the report shifted its focus from highlighting pesticide harms to directing the EPA to convince the public of its “robust review procedures” for pesticides.","November 23, 2025 - WASHINGTON— The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday approved the highly persistent pesticide isocycloseram for golf courses, lawns and food crops such as oranges, tomatoes, almonds, peas, and oats. The pesticide is a “forever chemical” — one of a group called PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

Today’s announcement marks the second approval of a PFAS pesticide since Trump took office, with the first approval coming just two weeks before. The administration plans to approve three more PFAS pesticides in the coming year.

“To approve more PFAS pesticides amid the growing awareness of the serious, long-term dangers from these forever chemicals is absurdly shortsighted,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The undeniable reality is that the Trump administration is knowingly putting the nation’s children at greater risk of developing serious reproductive and liver harms for generations to come.”

Isocycloseram is classified as moderately persistent to persistent and is known to transform into 40 smaller PFAS chemicals, some of which are much more highly persistent.

Among the most concerning harms from isocycloseram is reduced testicle size, lower sperm count, and liver toxicity. While the agency found that people would not be exposed to enough isocycloseram in their diet to cause these harms, it opted not to implement a child-safety buffer to account for the fact that children are more sensitive to chemical pollutants than adults. If that safety buffer were included, as it is with some other pesticides, young children would have been found to be at high risk of those effects from dietary exposure.

“For all of the rhetoric about caring about children’s health and well-being, this administration is quick to throw them under the bus whenever it suits their polluting benefactors,” said Donley. “Instead of erring on the side of safety, we get a quick, reckless approval of a new forever chemical without any real thought given to its serious harms.”

Isocycloseram is also highly toxic to bees and other pollinators, with the EPA finding that vital pollinators could be exposed to 1,500 times the lethal level of the pesticide just by collecting nectar and pollen near treated fields. One out of every 3 bites of food we eat — and nearly all nutrient-dense foods like fruits and vegetables — come from plants that need to be pollinated by bees and other pollinating animals.

In 2024 a report from researchers at the Center for Biological Diversity, Environmental Working Group, and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility found that forever chemicals are increasingly being added to U.S. pesticide products, contaminating waterways and posing potential threats to human health.

While some PFAS differ in their toxicities, potential to bioaccumulate, and potential to pollute water, all are highly persistent and have chemical bonds that essentially never break down. PFAS ingredients in pesticide products have been found to contaminate streams and rivers throughout the country.

As it pushed to approve PFAS pesticides, the EPA created a new webpage earlier this month to try to assure the public of its “robust, chemical-specific process” that it uses to approve any pesticide, even one that is a PFAS. This bold new push from the EPA comes directly from the recent Make America Healthy Again strategy report. Following pressure from the pesticide industry, the report shifted its focus from highlighting pesticide harms to directing the EPA to convince the public of its “robust review procedures” for pesticides.

Under the Trump administration, the pesticide office is controlled by two former lobbyists for the American Chemistry Council, Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva, and one former lobbyist for the pro-pesticide American Soybean Association, Kyle Kunkler.",http://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/animated_favicon1.gif,N,,2025-11-23 12:01:05.280943

“The first generation of plug-in hybrids was not used in electric mode very much,” said Colin McKerracher, who leads the Transport and Energy Storage Group at Bloomberg NEF.
“A lot of the early plug-in hybrids that were on the market were really compliance cars,” he told CBC News from Oslo.
In Canada, PHEVs helped manufacturers meet the Trudeau government’s roadmap to make all new car sales electric by 2035 — a mandate currently paused by the Carney government.
McKerracher expects around eight million PHEVs to be sold globally this year, compared to 14 million battery electric cars.","Pitched as a great compromise for the environmental ly conscious yet road-tripping driver, plug-in hybrids — or PHEVs — have a few problems.

For one, people aren’t plugging them in.

Study after study show these vehicles — which boast an electric motor for emission-free rides and a gas engine for longer range — are actually being used more in gas mode. This means they’re polluting a lot more than a customer might think.

Critics argue this discrepancy lets manufacturers get an attractive fuel consumption rating based on ideal conditions that aren’t being met by many drivers.

And as Canada considers the future of its electric vehicle regulations, there are questions about how plug-ins should count.

Lab vs. real world

PHEVs are about one per cent to three per cent of new Canadian car registrations in the last five years. Despite being the smallest chunk of electric car sales, that still amounts to hundreds of thousands of these vehicle s on Canadian roads.

The most recent criticism of PHEVs comes from an umbrella group of environmental NGOs, which used real-world fuel consumption data from hundreds of thousands of plug-in hybrids in Europe. The data is collected in the EU as part of regulation to prevent misrepresentation and fraud, taken wirelessly or during maintenance on any new cars after 2021.

The analysis found that electric mode was only used around 30 per cent of the time, despite official assumptions it would be used more than 80 per cent of the time. Carbon emissions were nearly five times higher than projected, and dr iver behaviour was part of the problem.

“The first generation of plug-in hybrids was not used in electric mode very much,” said Colin McKerracher, who leads the Transport and Energy Storage Group at Bloomberg NEF.

Typically, they had battery ranges of 50 to 80 kilometres and couldn’t fast charge, making it inconvenient for drivers to keep them topped up. In Europe, he says, a lot of these were company cars, further disincentivizing drivers who didn’t have to pay for gas anyway.

Compliance cars

For manufacturers, the incentive to make these cars was clear, experts say. As governments pushed to decarbonize transportation, PHEVs helped meet those new standards, McKerracher says.

“A lot of the early plug-in hybrids that were on the market were really compliance cars,” he told CBC News from Oslo. “They were either to satisfy [environmentally stricter] California regulations or European vehicle CO2 regulations to try and allow automakers to comply with tightening targets.”

At the same time, adding an electric motor could allow cost-savings through the same manufacturing process as non-electric models.

In Canada, PHEVs helped manufacturers meet the Trudeau government’s roadmap to make all new car sales electric by 2035 — a mandate currently paused by the Carney government.

Under that plan, both fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars count towards a manufacturer’s zero-emissions fl eet, while traditional hybrids would not. PHEVs could be as much as 45 per cent of a carmaker’s offerings until 2026, eventually decreasing to 20 per cent after a few years.

In a statement, Environment and Climate Change Canada said the pause on the EV mandate will “help reduce the economic pressure due to tariffs” and that its review “will consider the way PHEVs are treated under the regulations, among all other relevant considerations.”

David Adams, president and CEO of Global Automakers of Canada, a trade association, said that some flexibility is likely required when applying emissions credits to plug-in hybrids.

At the same time, he warns against treating PHEVs too equally, as automakers have invested heavily into full EV platforms.

“You don't necessarily want your commitment in that regard undermined by governments providing almost an equivalent credit for something that's not the same cost,” Adams explained.

The promise of compromise

For consumers, PHEVs can represent a stepping stone between traditional hybrid cars and fully battery-electric vehicles, addressing both range anxiety and a scarcity of charging stations.

As McKerracher puts it, “So that you can still go on that long road trip, but get some of the benefits of electric driving.”

That’s the reality for Marcia Scrimgeour, a retired senior living in Ottawa.

Scrimgeour's city driving is served well by her 2024 Kia Niro’s 55 kilometre electric range, which she charges at her condo. But when she travels to a cottage in the summer, ""there's no electrical facility — period,” she said.

Canada's electric charging infrastructure has improved over the years, but forecasts suggest a completely electric future requires hundreds of thousands more charging stations.

On a fixed income, Scrimgeour says her plug-in hybrid helps her save money and she only filled it with gas twice last winter. But Scrimgeour did confirm the other criticism of PHEVs and their greater-than-advertised fuel consumption: the sudden switchover from electric motor to engine.

“The only time it does it unexpectedly is if I accelerate unexpectedly. Like, from a stoplight, if I start up too quickly, despite the fact that I've still got lots of electrical charge available,” Scrimgeour said, adding that it switches back after braking.

Scrimgeour is the ideal use-case. But unlike in Europe, there is no widely available data about charging habits of Canadian plug-in drivers. Adam Thorn, director of the transportation program at the Pembina Institute, says it represents an “educational opportunity.”

“To really make sure that those who purchase those vehicles are aware of that opportunity to charge the vehicles overnight, for example,” Thorn explained, “[and] recognize that they're really not going to get the full fuel savings if they don't do so.”

In that recent European an alysis, the authors also found the real-world consumption meant paying about $800 more than expected at the pump.

After the speed bumps

Thorn sees a future for PHEVs in Canada, which doesn’t involve completely scrapping the mandate, as automakers have called for.

“We really do think it's a key policy to drive down emissions,” Thorn told CBC News from Oakville, Ont. Pembina’s position recommends letting PHEV models count towards 45 per cent of a manufacturer’s fleet until 2030.

Despite tariff uncertainty and the dismantling of EV supports in the U.S., there is still promise in this category.

McKerracher expects around eight million PHEVs to be sold globally this year, compared to 14 million battery electric cars. What’s more, even with the loss of consumer rebates earlier this year, PHEV sales seem to be holding year over year, especially compared to fully electric cars, which are down by 28,000 registrations compared to the same time last year.

“Right now, the mood seems to be that these represent actually potentially a growing segment of the zero emission vehicle portfolio,” Adams said.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/3ea67b93-f38d-439a-aefc-c994c2d9d996,1763743894648/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C308%2C5867%2C3300%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-23 11:03:23.645074

The funding comes from the Colorado Geothermal Energy Tax Credit Offering, which will go towards three installations and a feasibility study.

Geothermal energy is heat energy that comes from the earth, usually from reservoirs of hot water, according to the Department of Energy. The heat can be used to generate energy or for heating and cooling by using the earth for either heat storage to cool temperatures or a heat source for warmth.

There are a lot of benefits to geothermal technology, first and foremost being that it's renewable and sustainable. It's a clean energy source, so there's no planet-warming gases coming from geothermal energy plants, which also have a smaller footprint than a traditional fossil fuel power plant. That translates into better air quality.

According to the Clean Air Task Force, a study showed that the reduction in air pollution connected with geothermal development could result in health benefits worth between $6 and $23 billion.

In Vail, a thermal energy network will be installed between the Vail Public Library and Dobson Ice Arena. The Colorado Springs School District will create a thermal energy network between new and old buildings at a high school, while the Colorado Bathhouse in Denver will retrofit two buildings from 1948 with the tech. The feasibility study is being conducted in Steamboat Springs to assess a system for municipal buildings.

Colorado has become a leader in the United States in geothermal projects, having already invested a total of $23.2 million across 40 projects.

The draft rule was published in the Federal Register on Nov. 20.","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced a new proposed regulation that would revise the definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, a regulation that defines which water bodies and wetlands are federally protected under the Clean Water Act (CWA). As drafted, the rule would be much less restrictive than versions that were opposed by the Metals Service Center Institute (MSCI) and the broader manufacturing industry in the past.

Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the CWA is critical for manufacturers and metals companies that are developing new infrastructure projects. More specifically, clarifying which waters are covered could reduce delays for mining projects, including those involving rare earths and other critical minerals that manufacturers need.

The draft rule aims to bring WOTUS in line with a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court 2023 ruling that had reduced the scope of federal jurisdiction over waters and wetlands. Key proposed revisions include:

Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the CWA and Supreme Court precedent;

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear guidelines and recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems;

Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

The newly proposed rule is intended to be a “durable” definition that would end the more than-decade long cycle of successive administrations redefining the WOTUS standard, Administrator Zeldin said.

A new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA’s stance from a decade ago, it’s clear the world’s expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation.

In 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050.

Fast forward to today, and the IEA’s current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014’s best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040.

Today, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we’ll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It’s still far off from what’s needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it’s a significant shift in a short amount of time.

If the IEA’s earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today’s projections?

How you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines.

When forecasting the future, do you analyze today’s data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time? (An even nerdier way to look at it is, do you view the world through a lens of algebra or calculus?)

Put another way, will the world hit net zero in 2050? Today’s trend lines suggest we’ll miss that target by a wide margin. But if you look at how expectations have changed over the last decade, you might come up with a different answer. Instead, you might think the rate of change has increased, that we might be in the middle of an inflection point that starts to bend global emissions downward.

There are a few recent anecdotes to support the idea that we’re at an inflection point.

In Germany, sales of electric vehicles have set new records even after the government repealed incentives in 2023. In developing countries, renewables are reshaping the economies of developing countries, which were long thought to be among the last to adopt clean power. And China, which had previously refused to commit to reducing its carbon emissions, has now said its emissions will peak before 2030.

How the world views the future of carbon emissions has changed significantly over the past decade. A range of technologies have made that happen, including cheap solar and wind power paired with inexpensive batteries.

In the near future, geothermal energy and grid-optimizing software could propel the next leaps in optimism. For investors who agree, the upside could be dramatic.

For many climate tech investors, these days probably feel pretty gloomy. But amidst the gloom, there are still bright patches to be found.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1328659820.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-11-23 09:58:51.411567

Now it’s time to start doing some comparisons.

Well before the tax credits ended, in late February, I went and searched out some of the best deals I could find on Autotrader. There is no perfect comparison to the cars I found then, since there are at least small differences across every used car — as well as the fact that even cars that are the same model year are now 9 months older. Anyway, though, I tried to find models close to what I had found before. Let’s see how things changed. (I recommend opening the older article next to this one in order to be able to switch back and forth for more comparisons.)

Volkswagen ID.4

Starting with the Volkswagen ID.4, in February I found a 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S in my area with 27,844 miles on it for just $21,495. Looking today, here are some similar vehicles I found on Autotrader:

So, this first car has about 20,000 more miles on it, but it is the same trim (Pro S) and year (2021). The cost is $5,000 lower, though.

This one is more similar to the original, as it’s also a 2021 Pro S but it is 10,000 miles closer, actually having almost 10,000 fewer miles on it than the one I found in February. In this case, the price is still lower (despite lower mileage), but just about $1,500 lower.

This option has about 10,000 miles more than the original, but it’s a Pro rather than Pro S trim. (Big difference for buyers? I don’t know, but I doubt it.) The car is almost $5,000 cheaper than the one I found in February! And it also comes with the ID.4 Protection Package.

So, any broad conclusions? Well, you can get some used car options at the moment that have an upfront price that’s several thousand dollars lower than in February. That seems notable.

Hyundai IONIQ 5

Looking at another model, here’s what I wrote in February: “There are a several Hyundai IONIQ 5 options just above $25,000, but if you want that $4,000 tax credit, there’s just one Hyundai IONIQ 5 underneath that price. That would be a 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE w/ Cargo Package … with 42,363 miles on it. But, with a price of just $19,995 before the tax credit, that’s a wicked good deal.”

So, what’s available now? Here are three options I found:

This car is the same year as the one I found earlier in 2025, is an SEL instead of an SE, and has 37,000 miles instead of 42,000, among other small differences. But it costs ~$16,000 instead of ~$20,000. That’s basically a straight $4,000 cut!

If we go up a little bit in terms of model year, from 2022 to 2023 — but, admittedly, select a car with about 80 miles less range (but also more than 20,000 fewer miles on it) — we find an option with about the same price as the February find.

And here’s a 2023 model with more range and more miles on the clock but coming in at an even $20,000.

Kia EV6

Last but not least, let’s check out some Kia EV6 options. Here’s what I wrote in February: “I found a few models under $25,000, and several with more miles just above that marker, but here’s the one I’d highlight: 26,090 miles, 2022 Kia EV6 Wind, for just $21,998. Yes, please!”

This 2022 Kia EV6 Wind has a bit more mileage on it and is red, but is otherwise very similar to the original find in February. As it turns out, the price is almost the same as well, costing just about $600 more. That breaks the trend from above of costs coming down, though.

This 2022 EV6 Wind has more miles on it but does come in considerably cheaper, about $3,000 cheaper than the February low-price find.

And here’s another model with about twice as many models as my original find but costing about $2,000 less. Again, it’s also one model year younger, but otherwise very similar.

Last but not least, this car’s price is exactly the same as the one found in February! Differences include: it’s a Light rather than a Wind (meaning 80 fewer miles of range when new), it’s white instead of grey (yay!), and it has about 12,000 fewer miles on the odometer. Hmmm.

Looking at another model, here’s what I wrote in February: “There are a several Hyundai IONIQ 5 options just above $25,000, but if you want that $4,000 tax credit, there’s just one Hyundai IONIQ 5 underneath that price. That would be a 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE w/ Cargo Package … with 42,363 miles on it. But, with a price of just $19,995 before the tax credit, that’s a wicked good deal.”

So, what’s available now? Here are three options I found:

This car is the same year as the one I found earlier in 2025, is an SEL instead of an SE, and has 37,000 miles instead of 42,000, among other small differences. But it costs ~$16,000 instead of ~$20,000. That’s basically a straight $4,000 cut!

If we go up a little bit in terms of model year, from 2022 to 2023 — but, admittedly, select a car with about 80 miles less range (but also more than 20,000 fewer miles on it) — we find an option with about the same price as the February find.

And here’s a 2023 model with more range and more miles on the clock but coming in at an even $20,000.

Kia EV6

Last but not least, let’s check out some Kia EV6 options. Here’s what I wrote in February: “I found a few models under $25,000, and several with more miles just above that marker, but here’s the one I’d highlight: 26,090 miles, 2022 Kia EV6 Wind, for just $21,998. Yes, please!”

This 2022 Kia EV6 Wind has a bit more mileage on it and is red, but is otherwise very similar to the original find in February. As it turns out, the price is almost the same as well, costing just about $600 more. That breaks the trend from above of costs coming down, though.

This 2022 EV6 Wind has more miles on it but does come in considerably cheaper, about $3,000 cheaper than the February low-price find.

And here’s another model with about twice as many models as my original find but costing about $2,000 less. Again, it’s also one model year younger, but otherwise very similar.

Last but not least, this car’s price is exactly the same as the one found in February! Differences include: it’s a Light rather than a Wind (meaning 80 fewer miles of range when new), it’s white instead of grey (yay!), and it has about 12,000 fewer miles on the odometer. Hmmm.

What do you think of these used electric vehicle options compared to the February options? And what do you think is coming for this market?",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-Volkswagen-VW-ID4-Florida-watermark-scaled-e1759420269816.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 09:58:32.267952

The initiative, jointly led by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, seeks to expand clean-energy generation, improve electricity access for millions of households, and support sustainable economic growth across the continent.

A statement issued by the EU Delegation in Abuja on Sunday said, “The European Union led the pledging effort, with more than €15.1bn. This includes a pledge made by President von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, of over €10bn, as well as significant additional bilateral contributions by European financial institutions, member states and their development finance institutions, and estimated private investment mobilised.”

Von der Leyen said, “Today, the world has stepped up for Africa. With €15.5bn, we are turbocharging Africa’s clean-energy transition. Millions more people could gain access to electricity — real, life-changing power for families, businesses and entire communities.

“This investment is a surge of opportunity: thriving markets, new jobs, and reliable, clean energy that meets the needs of partners across the globe. President Ramaphosa and I both look forward to a clean-energy future for the continent — a future led by Africa, with strong support from its friend and partner, Europe.”

The Team Europe package includes new Global Gateway projects co-financed by Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as the European Investment Bank (€2.1bn) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (€740m).

Additionally, Italy (€2.4bn), Germany (over €2bn), the Netherlands including FMO (€250m), Portugal (€113m), Denmark (€81m), Sweden (€44m), Austria (€5m) and Ireland (€5m) made further bilateral commitments worth more than €5bn, while the EBRD announced a separate bilateral investment of over €600m.

Beyond European contributions, the African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20 per cent of the African Development Fund’s 17th replenishment to renewable energy. Norway also committed approximately €53m through its contribution to the same fund for 2026–2028.

According to campaign organisers, the pledges are expected to deliver 26.8 gigawatts of renewable-energy capacity and provide clean electricity to 17.5 million households currently without reliable power.

Of the €10bn pledged by von der Leyen for Team Europe, €3.1bn had been previously announced at major events, including the EU–South Africa Summit in March 2025, the Mattei Plan for Africa and Global Gateway event in June 2025, the Africa Climate Summit and UN General Assembly in September 2025, and the Global Gateway Forum in October 2025. The remaining €7bn was pledged at the final campaign event held in Johannesburg on 21 November.

The “Scaling up Renewables in Africa” campaign was launched in November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro to mobilise public and private financing for the continent’s energy transition. It aligns with global COP28 objectives to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy-efficiency improvements worldwide.

Africa remains one of the regions most affected by energy deficits, with 600 million people lacking electricity access. Despite possessing 60 per cent of the world’s best solar resources, the continent attracts just 2 per cent of global energy investment, hampered by high capital costs, geographic constraints and supply-chain barriers.

Redwood Materials Inc. raised $350 million in a Series E financing round that values the battery recycling company led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel at more than $6 billion.

The round was led by Eclipse, a venture capital firm focused on startups in real-world industries like manufacturing, and NVentures, the venture arm of Nvidia Corp., Redwood said in a statement Thursday.

The round values Redwood at more than $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private.

Redwood plans to use the fresh financing to speed energy-storage deployments, refining capacity and its engineering and operations teams, the company said.

Founded by Straubel in 2017, Redwood started out with a mission to onshore critical pieces of the EV battery supply chain by recycling batteries from aging electric vehicles and consumer electronics. With US EV sales failing to meet expectations and the Trump administration eliminating EV incentives, the company is now working to fulfill demand for clean, reliable energy to fuel data centers powering artificial intelligence.

“Many people think of us as a battery recycler only, but on top of that platform we’ve built a growing energy storage business that’s really quite exciting,” Straubel said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Thursday.

Redwood has said that adding batteries to power grids is key to fulfilling demand from energy-hungry data centers. The EV batteries it processes have reached the end of their useful life for transportation. But they’re still usable for grid-scale storage, which is the focus of the company’s Redwood Energy unit.

And while the Trump administration has ended government support for electric cars, its focus on securing critical minerals it deems essential to national security is a boon to Redwood and its business of extracting and processing battery metals, Straubel said.

“We’re a quite substantial source of cobalt, nickel and lithium and copper, all of which is domestically sourced,” he said. “From that point of view I’m perhaps even more excited about the core recycling business than I have been in the past.”

Critical minerals are integral to our modern way of life, from lithium in the smartphones we rely on to Rare Earth Elements (REEs) in the permanent magnets that drive the wind turbines and electric vehicles which will help power the green transition. These vital metals and minerals are used in communications, critical infrastructure, defence, renewable energy, transport and life sciences. Without them, our lives would grind to a halt. Industries would shut down overnight and communities would not be able to function.

In the UK alone, we anticipate that between now and 2035 yearly demand for copper will almost double, while demand for lithium will increase by 1,100%. As economies across the globe undertake the green transition, the demand for these minerals will only increase as their energy sources and transport systems become increasingly reliant on low-carbon technology.

In the global market, we have seen increasingly concentrated processing and mining supply chains in recent years. Such concentration means that the supply chain is particularly vulnerable to shocks such as natural disasters, war or geopolitical fallout. It is vital, therefore, that we have a plan to secure critical minerals for our industries and to diversify our supply chains.

This government recognises the huge opportunities on offer for both our critical minerals industry and the vital growth sectors it serves, which is why we are setting out our strategy to both take advantage of those opportunities and guard against the dangers of shortages or disruption.

Through this government’s Growth Mission, we are on the path to making the UK a world leader in technological innovation and a clean energy superpower. The Industrial Strategy launched in July 2025 underpins that Growth Mission, setting out a blueprint for 10 years of sustained economic growth through our most important growth sectors. This Critical Minerals Strategy – Vision 2035 – is key to making this a reality.

Our strategy sets out how we will grow our domestic production and use our international partnerships across the globe to support the resilience of the country’s Industrial Strategy growth sectors. In England, critical mineral strengths span areas such as the North East of England, including County Durham and Teesside, and the South West, including Devon and Cornwall. Scotland is embedding critical minerals’ resilience in its broader commitment to meeting net zero and creating a more circular economy. Wales has leveraged the geology and skills of the local workforce to retain nickel and titanium product manufacturing to this day. In Northern Ireland, research from the Queens University Belfast is contributing to new ways of recycling permanent magnets used in applications from wind turbines to vehicles.

By strengthening our own capabilities for mining, refining and recycling, we can create a more circular economy, support British industry, and reduce reliance on imports. This will be especially important in areas like the South West and the North East, which could see an industrial renaissance through the mining, processing and recycling of critical minerals.

Partnerships with resource-rich countries, alongside leveraging the UK’s capital markets, delivering our Trade Strategy and considering industry-led resilience measures in sensitive sectors like defence, will help secure the supply of critical minerals we need to meet future demand while supporting global diversification of critical minerals supply chains. We will promote supply chains that are responsible and transparent, upholding high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.

We will also strengthen the sector by utilising our world-leading credentials in academia, research and development (R&D), finance and trade – including the City of London and world leading institutions, like Camborne School of Mines. This will not only help expand our domestic production, but also enhance our ability to pursue our international growth partnerships, tap into global markets, and maintain reliable links with overseas supply chains during global shocks.

Vision 2035 directly links critical mineral demand to the UK’s growth sectors. We are not only identifying how short-term demand for critical minerals can be addressed, but also how the UK can create a thriving critical minerals industry which rejuvenates industrial communities and spurs growth in those sectors, including Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries, Digital and Technologies, Defence and Life Sciences.

Through this strategy we are taking bold steps to make the UK one of the most advanced, resilient and future-facing economies in the world.

Executive summary

Critical minerals are essential to the UK’s economy, national security, and clean energy transition. UK economic resilience is a core objective of the UK’s Industrial Strategy. As foundational inputs to sectors driving the Industrial Strategy, critical minerals are vital to achieving the government’s mission of stimulating long-term economic growth. However, the global geopolitical landscape and complex supply chains pose persistent challenges to securing these vital resources. In this global, dynamic context, a new approach to critical minerals is required.

This new, targeted Critical Minerals Strategy sets the UK’s long-term ambition for securing critical minerals and harnessing our competitive advantage in recycling and innovative midstream processing – the transformation of mined or recycled materials into refined or upgraded forms suitable for manufacturing. This approach is based on proactively addressing market challenges and anticipating future demand for key minerals to ensure a reliable, sustainable and future-proof supply of critical minerals.

Achieving our ambitions requires a whole-of-society effort – from the choices we make about recycling our old smartphones, through to the technologies we adopt to warm our homes, like heat pumps. Critical minerals are embedded throughout the UK economy, in the new technology consumers buy, the IT our businesses rely on, and in our critical national infrastructure.

The UK’s global positioning on critical minerals shares similarities with partners but also reflects distinct national characteristics. As a net importer of critical minerals, the UK faces strategic vulnerabilities, shared by partners such as the EU. Like the EU, we depend on geographically concentrated global supply chains for key sectors such as advanced manufacturing and defence. Unlike major producing countries, our domestic mining sector is smaller in scale, but it remains an important contributor to global markets.

In the context of increasing state intervention in critical mineral markets, the UK must prioritise how best to deploy its resources to achieve its aims. So, the UK must set out a path which reflects our unique set of strengths in securing critical minerals for the UK.

To reduce our vulnerability, the UK will make strategic use of its own available mineral resources and capabilities. At the same time, we will work with international partners, whether net importers similar to the UK, such as the EU, or major producers, like Canada or Australia, to build more resilient and diversified supply chains. By leveraging our strengths – such as world-class research and development, midstream processing and recycling capabilities, and vibrant capital markets – we will secure a resilient, sustainable supply of critical minerals for the Industrial Strategy’s 8 growth-driving sectors.

To focus efforts across government and support collaboration with industry, we have 2 key policy objectives:

optimise domestic production

build resilient UK and global supply networks

Optimising domestic production of critical minerals will help protect UK supply against global trade and supply chain disruptions. It is key that the UK makes the most of its mineral deposits while cultivating our midstream processing and recycling to help enable a circular economy and reduce the impact of external shocks.

We will do so by supporting UK businesses through our strong public finance offer, including the National Wealth Fund (NWF) and UK Export Finance (UKEF). We will provide support on energy prices for eligible businesses, including a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) and will launch a consultation on eligibility for the scheme shortly.

We will support permitting for innovative projects through the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service and understand and support the skills required in the UK, in collaboration with Skills England and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). And following the 2025 Spending Review, the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) will provide funding support of up to £50 million for critical mineral projects in the UK, as part of the wider innovation landscape.

We will work with industry to explore a demand aggregation platform to map their demand for critical minerals across the UK. This will support government and industry to have a much richer picture of UK industrial demand across many downstream sectors. In doing so, it will enable better decisions on where to target government engagement and support to help UK companies invest to secure a critical mineral supply internationally and de-risk their further business.

We will also consider options to implement targeted, industry-led resilience measures for the UK defence sector. Measures could include stockpiling, including through procurement mechanisms. This aligns with the Ministry of Defence’s commitments to build resilience in critical mineral supplies for UK defence and use its procurement levers to promote resilient defence supply chains set out in the Defence Industrial Strategy 2025 sector plan.

To ensure the UK has a secure, diverse supply of critical minerals and to limit our exposure to global shocks, we will support UK industry and identify investment opportunities in shared supply chains by building and leveraging international partnerships. Our international partners will benefit from the UK’s world class capital markets, financial services sector, public finance institutions, world leading academic research, technological innovation, and geological, mining and technical expertise, in developing these deeper partnerships.

We will support this more targeted international approach through engagement in multilateral forums such as the G7, G20, Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), International Energy Agency (IEA) and NATO, along with promoting responsible and transparent supply chains through initiatives such as the Global Clean Power Alliance (GCPA). These multilateral organisations and initiatives play an important role in coordinating investment and action on supply chains, setting common standards and promoting responsible and transparent supply chains.

Finally, to support our 2 key policy objectives, we are building on the existing list of critical minerals by also introducing the UK’s first growth minerals list. This will complement the Critical Mineral Intelligence Centre’s UK 2024 criticality assessment by anticipating future demand of minerals for the Industrial Strategy’s growth-driving sectors. As we plan for future criticality and growth assessments, we will evaluate which additional minerals and materials will need to be in scope to reflect the UK economy’s growing demands amidst evolving global supply chain dynamics.

To drive progress towards Vision 2035, we are setting out our ambition in tangible terms, ensuring progress can be measured and tracked. We recognise the fast-changing nature of the critical minerals landscape, so we will be agile and responsive to new, emerging challenges in our strategy implementation while ensuring we are delivering our long-term vision.

Vision 2035

The UK’s Industrial Strategy and the accompanying sector plans set out how the government’s mission of kick-starting economic growth will be achieved. Critical minerals are identified as a foundational industry to the majority of the Industrial Strategy’s growth-driving sectors and are vital to delivering the growth mission. However, the current geopolitical and trade environment reflect the complexity of critical minerals’ supply chains and persistent market challenges.

A proactive approach is needed to ensure the UK retains and future-proofs our supply of critical minerals. Working in close partnership with industry, including producers, traders and users of critical minerals, this new, targeted Critical Minerals Strategy sets a shared long-term ambition for addressing these complex market challenges and supporting the growth-driving sectors.

To anticipate future demand for growth-driving sectors and to help realise government’s missions over the next 10 years, our strategy sets out a clear vision for UK critical mineral supply chains to 2035:

The UK has the critical minerals it needs to drive economic growth and the clean energy transition, harnessing our competitive advantage in midstream processing and recycling of critical minerals.

Features of the ambition

To ensure clear industry and government progress towards delivering the Vision 2035 in partnership, we define success as:

at least 10% of annual UK demand for critical minerals (see Table 1) in the aggregate is met through domestic production (primary extraction, processing and refining of critical minerals) by 2035

as part of this, at least 50,000 tonnes of lithium (or lithium carbonate equivalent ) is produced domestically by 2035

20% of total annual UK demand for critical minerals is met through recycling of products to recover critical minerals by 2035

supply is diversified, so that no more than 60% of the UK’s annual demand for critical minerals in the aggregate is supplied by any one country by 2035

Success will require sustained effort, delivered by private investment and through the actions and choices of critical mineral producers, traders and users. the government will set the conditions for success by facilitating and assisting private sector activity through the measures in this strategy.

UK strengths

We will leverage the UK’s range of existing strengths in critical minerals to boost our domestic production while demonstrating what the UK brings to international growth partnerships. The UK’s strengths are outlined as follows.

Research and development (R&D) and innovation

The UK has an extensive network of universities and academic centres of research on critical minerals. Institutions such as the Camborne School of Mines, University of Birmingham, and Queens University Belfast are developing key technologies and knowledge to support UK industry and unlock innovation across disciplines – including chemistry, metallurgy, geology, midstream processing, recycling and mining engineering. The British Geological Survey, a world-leading geological survey and global geoscience organisation, supports innovation, through monitoring and innovative projects which address the changing scientific challenges of stakeholders. We also need to ensure we maintain and grow our human capital across such institutions to achieve our Vision 2035.

Midstream processing and recycling expertise

In April 2025, Frazer-Nash Consultancy, in partnership with the Critical Minerals Association (CMA) and the Materials Processing Institute (MPI), delivered a report assessing the potential to grow the UK’s midstream processing and recycling capability. The report highlights the UK’s well established and growing capabilities in refining and recycling specific critical minerals, such as lithium, REEs and PGMs, all to high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.

Expertise across the value chain and the UK’s mineral wealth

The UK offers outstanding capabilities across the full mining and minerals value chain (the stages of turning mined minerals into finished products) at home and overseas. Hosting both global mining major and junior miners, UK companies provide expertise across the mining lifecycle from extraction to midstream processing and recycling to supporting services such as finance, legal, and consultancy.

Furthermore, the UK has distinct pockets of mineral wealth with a deep mining history, such as:

tungsten and tin in Devon and Cornwall

lithium in Cornwall, Teesside and County Durham

exploration underway for copper and zinc in Anglesey

tellurium and antimony in Mid-Tyrone

nickel and cobalt in Aberdeenshire

Centre of mining finance and metals trading

London plays a key role in developing domestic projects and mobilising finance internationally, contributing to the development of resilient and sustainable supply chains. A range of mining companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and the City of London continues to operate as a centre for mining finance. The London Metal Exchange (LME) is a global hub for metals trading which supports critical minerals trading with physically settled exchange traded contracts in aluminium, cobalt, nickel, copper, tin and zinc, and a cash settled contract in lithium. It is planning to launch an expanded market for sustainably sourced metals which will support responsible transparent supply chains. The exchange is closely consulting with stakeholders on proposals for 4 key metals: aluminium, zinc, copper, and nickel.

In addition, ICE Futures Europe – the UK exchange that hosts trading in half the world’s crude and refined oil futures – has recently expanded into critical minerals with the introduction of 4 battery material contracts in lithium and cobalt. Through this, the UK can help facilitate solutions to the price transparency challenges and also provide certainty and stability to businesses.

Regional clusters

UK strengths are concentrated in clusters across the UK – including Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Cornwall, Devon, County Durham, Fort William, South Wales and Teesside – where the right expertise, geological and geographical assets make these places optimal for domestic production. Additionally, the UK’s investment zones and freeports, such as Teesside, offer a strong base on which to build and scale up critical mineral businesses. These will be strengthened through the Industrial Strategy Zones Action Plan.

International development and diplomacy

We have a strong diplomatic network with expertise across commercial and development issues to support investments, exports and local development. Our networks and UK mining services expertise means we can support countries’ delivery of critical minerals projects, helping to reduce negative impacts on local communities, environmental damage and risks around the initiation or exacerbation of conflict.

The UK has been a part of crucial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO). Our ISO membership through the British Standards Institution (BSI) ensures we can influence global standards to increase transparency while promoting responsible practices. In turn, this creates highly visible and resilient global supply.

Policy objectives

Optimise domestic production

The critical minerals sector contributes £1.79 billion to the UK economy and directly supports over 50,000 jobs. Currently there are over 50 critical mineral projects based in the UK. Spanning established production facilities, alongside mining, processing or recycling projects at various stages of development, these projects represent the UK’s domestic capabilities across the supply chain, particularly in the midstream.

Producing more critical minerals domestically to high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards will become increasingly vital to meet UK demand, in a world of shifting geopolitics and potential for supply chain disruptions. To do so, we will need to address the key challenges facing many of our domestic businesses, from high energy costs to planning and permitting to skills and access to finance.

We have 2 domestic sources of critical minerals: those in the ground and those in our homes and businesses. Building an innovative circular economy to not only recycle, but also reuse, repair and prolong the life of products containing critical minerals allows us to fully utilise the second source. In doing so, we use the resources already within the UK, reduce import reliance and reduce waste, pollution and carbon emissions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (Defra) upcoming Circular Economy Growth Plan will drive England’s transition away from a “take-make-waste” model by promoting resource efficiency, reducing waste and supporting green jobs and infrastructure.

To support optimisation of domestic capabilities while better securing our supply of critical minerals, greater visibility is needed of UK supply chains at each stage, from mining to downstream manufacturing, by both industry and government. Mapping UK supply chains will deepen our understanding of any gaps in UK supply chains and help us focus on international collaboration and investment opportunities.

UK-wide approach

White this is a UK government Critical Minerals Strategy, we work together with devolved administrations to ensure that the strategy is tailored to the needs of industry and leverages strengths across the whole of the UK.

The Scottish Government is advancing its approach to critical minerals as part of its broader commitment to resilient and sustainable supply chains that support the transition to net zero in Scotland. Core to the Scottish Government’s approach is creating a more circular economy, where critical materials are recovered and recycled as recognised within Scotland’s Draft Circular Economy Strategy. Its Scottish National Adaptation Plan 3 and Green Industrial Strategy also recognise the importance of strengthening the resilience of critical minerals supply chains against external shocks. The Scottish Government and its national economic development agency, Scottish Enterprise, are building a stronger evidence base on future vulnerabilities and opportunities for critical minerals in the Scottish economy.

During the 19th century, Wales was a world centre for metal smelting and processing, including steel, zinc, lead and copper. With this strong history in metal production, Wales has utilised the advantages of the local geology and the skills of the local workforce to retain nickel and titanium product manufacturing to this day. Building on legacies of past practices, Wales is global leader in the transition to a circular economy. The Welsh Government’s circular economy strategy, Beyond Recycling, highlights the need to capture and feed key materials back into the economy to build supply chain resilience.

Northern Ireland has a diverse mineral heritage, with historic mining focused on the productions of iron ore, salt and gold. Building on this, Northern Ireland recognises that security of supply is critical for high-value manufacturing and renewable energy technology, and that moving towards a circular economy is vital to reducing pressure on primary supply. Northern Ireland is pioneering innovation in the field of critical minerals recovery from end-of-life products, with research from the Queens University Belfast contributing to new ways of recycling permanent magnets used in applications from wind turbines to vehicles.

In England, critical mineral strengths span areas such as the North East of England, including County Durham and Teesside, and the South West, including Devon and Cornwall. For example, the Critical Minerals Challenge Centre, based at the University of Exeter with funding from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), was created in autumn 2024 in partnership with multiple businesses, Cornwall, Devon and Somerset Councils, Great South West and regional non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

Produce more and better

Domestic production is vital to develop our domestic supply of critical minerals in the UK. And it is only possible by addressing the key challenges facing many of our domestic businesses, in particular high energy costs, planning, permitting, skills and access to finance. Our aim is that production in the UK is focused on both mining and processing critical minerals to high ESG standards as well as recycling, repurposing and reusing critical minerals in a circular economy.

Energy costs and infrastructure

Our new Critical Minerals Strategy aligns with the Industrial Strategy’s commitment to tackle unreasonably high energy costs, continually cited as a key barrier across industry. The introduction of the new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) will bring Great Britain energy costs more in line with other major economies in Europe across the most electricity-intensive manufacturing industries of the Industrial Strategy’s 8 growth-driving sectors, and the foundational industries, including critical minerals. Eligibility of BICS will be informed by an upcoming consultation. From 2027, this new scheme will reduce electricity costs by up to £40 per megawatt hour, which could benefit over 7,000 businesses.

The British Industry Supercharger already supports many electricity-intensive industries, including some existing producers of critical minerals. We are planning to review eligibility for this scheme in 2026 to ensure that it targets those businesses most at risk of carbon leakage from high electricity costs. We will actively consult with stakeholders as part of the review and ensure that businesses in the critical minerals industry engage in this process. Furthermore, we have committed to increasing the level of relief offered through the Network Charging Compensation Scheme from 60% to 90% from 2026. This will further reduce electricity prices for the 500 most electricity-intensive businesses by £7 to £10 per megawatt hour, bringing the total discount offered by the British Industry Supercharger to around £78 per megawatt hour.

A number of critical mineral producers already benefit from energy support, but many critical mineral projects are not yet fully operational and producing commercially. With long project life cycles from mineral exploration to production, the early-stage projects of today are the producers for 2030 to 2035 and beyond. We will need to support these future projects to commercialisation through competitive energy costs and the associated grid infrastructure to access energy. The Industrial Strategy also sets out its commitment to build up electricity network supply chains to this end.

Environmental planning and permitting

To support growth sectors, the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service allows developers in England to work with a dedicated team for innovative projects requiring complex permitting solutions. The scope of this service has been extended to include the critical minerals industry. Coordinators will bring together the expertise and advice required to successfully navigate the requirements of the Environmental Permitting Regulations and ensure the process meets critical deadlines . These service improvements will result in quicker timeframes and more flexible decision-making in moving developers through the system.

The government recently consulted on reforms to modernise environmental permitting for industry and energy sectors – with the government response to the consultation planned for early 2026. The reforms aim to support industrial innovation through regulatory sandboxes, to streamline regulation of low-risk sectors and to ensure necessary standards are developed promptly for high-growth sectors to enable rapid permitting. The consultation included a section on mining and treatment of metals and minerals.

National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) consultation

The revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), published in December 2024, sets out the government’s planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied. This includes setting out policies in relation to facilitating the sustainable use of minerals. The government remains committed to delivering a streamlined, plan-led planning system that is pro-growth, accessible, and offers greater certainty. The government will consult on a clearer set of national policies to support decision-making this year.

Skills in the UK’s critical minerals and mining industry

Domestic production relies on people’s skills and capabilities in the UK that span the critical minerals value chain as well as across industry, academia, and research. Just as we anticipate demand for critical minerals to grow, so will the need for the commensurate workforce and talent to help meet this demand.

It is therefore imperative to explore the skills needed by the critical minerals and mining industry, working collaboratively with Skills England and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to ensure a joined-up understanding of current and future skills needs, while supporting people to pursue careers in the industry through Jobcentre Plus and the new Jobs and Careers Service in England. This collaboration will build on the skills development activity led by the Critical Minerals Association, funded by the Department for Business and Trade, which brings industry, academia and government together to consider the skills required to grow the UK critical minerals industry and identify barriers and solutions for retaining and attracting talent.

Access to finance for domestic companies

Lack of access to finance is a key barrier to the market’s ability to respond to the anticipated rise in demand for critical minerals. Price decreases and volatility hit new and emerging projects the hardest as investors look to invest in stable and diversified supply chains. For example, in 2024, lithium spot prices fell by 75%, and cobalt, nickel and graphite prices dropped by 30% to 45% . The long lead time for a mine to come online after mineral discovery, and the uncertainty associated with future commercial success, present additional risks to investment. Therefore, providing access to finance to help reduce risk for these projects is often essential.

The UK has a strong public finance offer available to support UK critical minerals companies, from the National Wealth Fund (NWF) to UK Export Finance (UKEF) and the British Business Bank (BBB), as detailed in this section. However, the mandates of our public finance institutions (PuFins) can constrain their ability to address emerging risks and market volatility associated specifically with critical minerals projects. This has resulted in some critical mineral companies and projects finding it difficult to access government-backed support.

To address this, we will work with UK PuFins to identify ways in which critical minerals projects with high potential and strategic value can be supported more effectively by government in a more coherent way. In doing so we will boost jobs, growth and the resilience of UK critical mineral supply chains.

As part of our review of the role of UK PuFins, we have agreed to expand the eligibility criteria for UKEF’s Critical Minerals Supply Finance. This will ensure the scheme remains responsive to current and future UK offtake demand, while also supporting the development of bilateral and multilateral supply chains. As a first step, UKEF has updated its eligibility to include the new growth minerals list.

While the UK has some financing and grant processes in place to support certain critical mineral projects at specific levels, there is an opportunity to provide more bespoke, targeted grant funding to help deliver our growth mission. Following Spending Review 2025, funding of up to £50 million will be made available by DBT to support critical mineral projects, which could include expanding research and innovation as well as supporting commercialisation. Further detail will be announced in 2026.

To date, the government has provided over £165 million of support to critical businesses right across the UK. Looking forward and taken together, the government fully supports the UK’s growing critical mineral sector through the new up to £50 million critical mineral fund, as well as DRIVE35 and the PuFins outlined in this section.

Attracting investment

A whole-of-government approach is being taken to attract and enable investment into the UK. DBT is working with over 50 critical minerals growth projects across the critical minerals value chain. We have worked closely with the Critical Minerals Association and industry to produce a new investment prospectus showcasing the UK’s capabilities and helping to attract investment.

DBT’s Office for Investment (OfI) and the UK’s extensive network of embassies and high commissions around the world will continue to support investors interested in these opportunities. The expanded OfI is responsible for driving a strategic cross-government approach to investment, streamlining the government’s approach to securing investment aligned to the Industrial Strategy priorities. OfI will bring together expertise from industry and business to provide a bespoke service to support investors, land investment and overcome barriers to growth.

Driving Research and Investment in Vehicle Electrification (DRIVE35)

As announced in the Advanced Manufacturing Sector Plan, Driving Research and Investment in Vehicle Electrification (DRIVE35) will support the latest R&D in strategic vehicle technologies, accelerate their commercial scale-up, and unlock capital investments in zero-emission vehicles, batteries and their supply chains. DRIVE35 builds on the Advanced Propulsion Centre R&D programmes and the Automotive Transformation Fund, which has funded a number of critical mineral projects that strengthen the UK’s electric vehicle (EV) supply chains from lithium refinery Green Lithium to battery recycler Altilium.

National Wealth Fund

The National Wealth Fund (NWF) is at the forefront of investing public money across the UK. It has £27.8 billion financial capacity to help deliver the government’s growth and clean energy missions, generate a return for the taxpayer, and crowd in significant private investment.

The NWF finances investment in capital-intensive projects across the UK and has the mandate to support projects in the critical minerals sector where they meet NWF’s investment criteria. NWF has a range of tools including loans, guarantees and equity investments which it can deploy. NWF prioritises investments across the clean energy, digital and technologies, advanced manufacturing and transport sectors, and can also play a role in supporting the delivery of the wider industrial strategy, including the defence sector. This includes investments to support supply chain resilience across these sectors to better support the UK’s resilience and economic security.

In the last 2 years, NWF has completed equity investments of £24 million into Cornish Lithium (2023) and £28.6 million into Cornish Metals (2025) to support UK critical mineral supply chain resilience. In 2025, the NWF announced a further £31 million commitment to invest in Cornish Lithium .

UK Export Finance

UK Export Finance (UKEF), the UK’s export credit agency, has a mission to ensure that no viable export fails for lack of finance or insurance, doing that sustainably and at no net cost to the taxpayer. UKEF has a suite of products comprising of guarantees, loans and insurance that can support domestic and international critical minerals projects. Through its flexible working capital support to UK exporters, UKEF can support domestic businesses and those that are seeking to invest in the UK (with plans to export in future), and can also come alongside other UK public finance institutions and government funding schemes.

UKEF recently expanded its domestic financial support to include both the domestic producers and suppliers of UK exporters who are involved in critical minerals supply chains. The Critical Goods Export Development Guarantee enables suppliers of critical minerals products to UK exporters, to access working capital, helping them to secure long-term import contracts or invest in domestic capability building. These suppliers play an important role in the value chain as producers and importers of critical minerals. To qualify for this support, 50% of the supplier’s critical minerals-related production needs to go to a UK exporter or exporters. This support aims to give these firms the finance they need to make investments that will protect them from geopolitical risks and bolster supply chain resilience.

British Business Bank

As announced in the Industrial Strategy, a new £4 billion initiative, British Business Bank (BBB) Industrial Strategy Growth Capital, will be invested through the BBB’s existing capabilities across the 8 growth-driving sectors. There is also BBB’s Nations and Regions Investment Funds, which supports innovation and creating local opportunity for new and growing businesses across the UK. Given critical minerals are a foundational industry to the growth sectors, and considering the regional clusters of critical minerals expertise, BBB will explore how their initiatives may ensure that critical minerals SMEs can access the appropriate finance options to start and scale in the UK.

Promote a circular economy

Given the significant increase in demand for critical minerals over the next 10 years, primary sources cannot meet this demand alone, as highlighted by our demand signals in Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex. That is why the UK will look to build on its strengths in recycling to maximise the amount of critical minerals which can be recovered, and R&D and innovation to reduce, substitute or prolong critical mineral usage. This presents not only an economic opportunity, but reduces waste, cuts carbon emissions, and increases the UK’s security of supply.

Currently, recycling of critical minerals is held back by a low availability of critical mineral-rich waste streams, low collection rates and the high cost and difficulty of recovering critical minerals from end-of-life products like electronic equipment, EV batteries and wind turbines.

Despite this, some critical minerals have a good recycling rate at end of life because of their value and high technical recyclability. For example, PGMs that enter secondary production directly from industrial processes, such as industrial catalysts, are recycled at a rate near the 95% maximum potential . This success rate is evidenced by the UK being home to the largest PGM secondary refiner in the world, Johnson Matthey.

Due to timescales at which clean energy technologies will reach end of life, recycled sources of critical minerals will ramp up from 2030 and become a significant source of critical minerals by 2040 . This timescale grants government and industry a window of opportunity to consider appropriate action and build on the available domestic opportunities.

Promoting a circular economy in the UK will also support the UK’s wider commitment to circularity in global supply chains, and efforts through the Global Clean Power Alliance, a multilateral initiative to speed up the clean energy transition.

Circular Economy Growth Plan

DBT is working closely with Defra and other government departments on the forthcoming Circular Economy (CE) Growth Plan for England. The plan will be England only in scope and will consider policy areas that are a reserved competence, such as waste exports. The government will actively look for opportunities to align with the work that devolved governments have underway.

The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act includes measures that aim to incentivise the recyclability of critical materials, which are compatible with the aims of our Critical Minerals Strategy. In April 2025, the government agreed to add the relevant provisions of the Act to the Windsor Framework, applying them in Northern Ireland, and to consider equivalent arrangements in Great Britain where necessary. This commitment has been taken into account in development of the CE Growth Plan for England.

The CE Growth Plan will outline regulatory reform to incentivise the recovery of critical minerals from end-of-life products alongside reducing demand. Boosting the UK’s domestic recycling skills and infrastructure is a prerequisite to delivering an effective resilient circular economy for critical minerals. Development of the CE Growth Plan has encompassed key insights from the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre alongside the new UK Technology Metals Observatory and Met4Tech’s circular economy roadmaps on battery materials and rare earth magnets.

Map and secure UK supply chains

Tracing the journey of critical minerals from mine to end product, across multiple geographies and numerous entities, is complex. Due to the opaque nature of supply chains, and depending on the sector in which critical minerals are used, there is often a lack of clear data on supply chains which fulfil UK demand.

Building on work to date, we will continue to work closely with CMIC and DBT’s Supply Chains Centre in collaboration with industry stakeholders to better understand both the reach, gaps and vulnerabilities in UK supply chains. The UK Technology Metals Observatory will work alongside CMIC to provide data on the stocks and flows of technology metals in the UK and globally.

We will work with industry to explore a demand aggregation platform to help unlock opportunities for the UK, both domestically and internationally. This platform will help to identify where the UK’s growing domestic capabilities can meet specific growth sector requirements, allowing us to focus investment and government support. It will also facilitate decisions on where joint action between industry and government can secure supply from international partners in a more coordinated way.

A key limiting factor in the data on critical mineral supply chains is the lack of visibility on critical minerals in embedded components. To date, and as demonstrated by Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex, we have focused on the UK’s need for primary and midstream resources needed for the growth sectors. Future data and analysis including by CMIC and the UK Technology Metals Observatory will help increase our understanding of the current and anticipated future flow of minerals in specific technologies and for industrial decarbonisation.

Supply chain resilience for UK defence sector

Recognising the increasing complexity of global supply chains and their implication for national security, the UK will support industry-led supply chain resilience in the UK defence sector. We will consider mechanisms for establishing and building resilience in critical mineral supply into the UK defence sector. This could, for example, take the form of industry-held stockpiles mandated through government procurement mechanisms, or ensuring defence equipment always source critical minerals from more than one country.

We will also explore opportunities to collaborate on increasing strategic resilience with other partners implementing similar approaches. This approach will help to reduce the economic security risks in key supply chains. In the long-term this can be used to help to build diverse sources of critical mineral supply more broadly.

As one of the UK’s established economic tools, the National Security and Investment (NSI) Act gives the government powers to intervene in investments and other acquisitions of control in the UK economy to protect national security.

The government is currently reviewing the Notifiable Acquisition Regulations (NARs), which define the areas of the economy subject to mandatory notification under the NSI Act. Proposals in the NARs consultation, which closed on 14 October 2025, include the creation of a standalone Critical Minerals area (currently covered within the Advanced Materials area). The government will report on changes to the regulations in due course.

As shown by both these case studies, UK critical mineral supply chains are part of broad and complex global networks. They span mining, intermediate processing and manufacturing, across multiple jurisdictions. The UK’s projected increase in demand of minerals vital to growth-driving sectors is set to rise (see Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex. Rise in global demand and reliance on finite sources is creating supply pressures and unstable markets. Initiatives to optimise domestic capabilities must work hand in hand with our international collaboration. Working with international partners is crucial to delivering Vision 2035.

Resilient global supply networks

We will continue to be reliant on imports of critical minerals, even as we ramp up our domestic capabilities, and improve our circular economy. Our future demand for critical minerals cannot be met by domestic production alone, and we will therefore need to diversify our supply of critical minerals through working with international partners. Currently, we are seeing increased global protectionism, unfair market practices, and increasingly concentrated processing and mining supply chains, threatening the UK’s economic security.

Meeting the future mineral needs of the UK’s industrial strategy sectors will require a step change in the way we build international partnerships. Those partnerships will drive direct relationships between industries, governments and other key stakeholders and will be essential to building global diversity and resilience, enabling the global energy transition, and promoting equitable international development.

Along with countries across the world, diversification of processing and mining internationally is a key goal of this strategy in order to safeguard access to these minerals for our business and to bring economic growth to the country. The 60% success feature supporting diversification set out in our Vision 2035 is ambitious.

China’s central position in global critical mineral production has created highly concentrated supply chains. For example, China dominates the rare earths supply chain, controlling 70% and 90% of rare earth mining and refining, respectively. We will continue to work closely with China while building wider international partnerships to diversify supply to ensure the UK has the sustainable long-term supply our businesses and people need.

To deliver greater diversification, we will form strong strategic relationships with partners to help mitigate supply disruptions and potential export restrictions risks. We will develop international growth partnerships, mobilise investment and leverage our country’s central role in mining finance – particularly the UK’s strengths in capital and commodity markets, and continue to promote responsible and transparent supply chains.

Developing international growth partnerships will set the UK and our industries in the right direction to meet our 60% success feature to diversify supply chains as we look to secure supplies of critical minerals from key trading partners, resource-rich countries and technology partners. Working with these partners, we will also look at ways to secure global supply where joint action will be most successful while identifying where we can support local value creation, economic diversification and sustainable jobs through our international development expertise and programming. Multilaterally, we will continue to work through international forums including the G7, G20, International Energy Agency, Minerals Security Partnership and NATO to promote high ESG standards which incorporate conflict sensitivity, ensure responsible business practices and share data.

International growth partnerships

We will deepen relationships with key trading partners and develop international growth partnerships with resource-rich countries and technology partners to help UK industry secure its critical mineral supply, complementing domestic initiatives and supporting broader international objectives shared by the UK and international partners.

Given the global nature of supply chains, shared approaches to developing supply chains are essential. Working with partners, we can also identify joint solutions for project development, financing, construction and offtake. The UK will export its expertise in standards, R&D capability, surveying, and finance, working with partners across a complex security and economic landscape.

We will draw upon the deep and varied expertise available in partner countries, pooling our knowledge, relationships and tools to achieve our collective aims and drawing upon the strengths of others. We will align policies in areas like standards and traceability where possible.

As well as the UK’s expertise, international growth partnerships will be underpinned by:

supply chain collaboration, including demand aggregation and industry offtake facilitation (supporting long-term supply agreements between UK buyers and international producers)

access to finance for international supply chains

using trade policy tools to promote and protect the UK’s security of supply for critical minerals

reinforcing multilateral action

Supply chain collaboration

As we develop international growth partnerships with other countries, we will gain an increased understanding of how collaboration can help meet the UK’s demand requirements and achieve broader goals and ambitions set in collaboration with like-minded partners internationally.

Through conducting supply chain analysis both across the UK and in conjunction with our international partners, we will be able to identify priority projects and scope the potential for both private investment and public finance for these projects. This will support the UK in diversifying its supply of critical minerals and focusing our international engagement on the highest value partnerships.

Priority partners include but are not limited to the United States, EU, Canada, Australia, Saudi Arabia, India and Japan. We will also continue to refine our partnership with countries with whom the UK has existing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs).

China is our fifth largest single country trading partner and an important player in critical minerals markets. We will be guided in our engagement by the principles set out in the UK’s Trade Strategy.

International offtake agreements

The UK will take a more active role in helping to facilitate offtake contracts, potentially through a demand aggregation platform that DBT will explore, taking account of the experience of partners developing or considering other similar initiatives. Such a platform could make it easier for UK buyers to collaborate on securing offtake from overseas critical minerals projects in partner countries by benefitting from economies of scale. This approach will be supported by UKEF’s Critical Minerals Supply Finance support described in the ‘Access to finance for international supply chains’ section.

This more proactive approach to securing offtake agreements by the UK will increase the likelihood of identifying new sources of supply in partner countries. This will have an additional mutual benefit to our relations with these countries. Further, by aggregating demand, the UK can promote sustainable credentials and sourcing of critical minerals for upstream suppliers.

A system for aggregating UK demand will broaden the UK’s scope for collaboration with international partners and support the development of targeted international growth partnerships.

Access to finance for international supply chains

Developing new, diverse supply chains to support UK industry requires investment. This can come from private investors and industry, or public sources like development finance institutions and export credit agencies, like UKEF.

UKEF can provide support to UK supply chains through its Critical Minerals Supply Finance. This support is available to overseas critical minerals projects or companies (including producers of goods containing critical minerals) that supply UK exporters with long-term offtake or import contracts.

UKEF can also work with other international export credit agencies and overseas governments’ public finance institutions, including development banks, to co-finance projects in third countries. This support helps to de-risk projects, crowd-in private finance and secure UK supply chains. UKEF’s standard international buyer finance support (where eligibility is based on the procurement of UK goods and services contracts) is also available to support critical minerals companies and projects.

UKEF also recently launched the Early Project Services Guarantee which can support critical minerals projects. This provides a guarantee to a bank making a loan to an overseas buyer to finance the purchase of design, engineering or technical services from a UK supplier for early-stage project work such as feasibility studies, conceptual designs, and surveys.

We will commit to working with UK public finance institutions to explore how they can further support critical minerals supply chains.

Alongside these targeted efforts, the UK will seek to encourage more investment into mining globally, working with multilateral development banks, and address barriers to investment.

Trade policy

We will continue to identify and address market access barriers in key export markets, which cause additional costs to companies in the UK’s critical minerals supply chains. We will help to ease regulatory burdens, unlock new overseas investment, and assess the impact of export controls on critical minerals. Where consistent with the Trade Strategy, we will consider the use of trade policy levers to ensure the supply of critical minerals into the UK, and support domestic extraction and recycling.

In line with the Trade Strategy, we will consider where we can deepen relationships with established trading partners. Using growth minerals and accompanying demand signals, we will develop agreements with new partners to support greater investment in new secure and transparent supply chains of critical minerals across borders, helping to diversify global supply chains. For future free trade agreements (FTAs) the UK will seek to pursue higher ambition outcomes regarding critical minerals, for example with the inclusion of specific chapters on critical minerals collaboration or supply chains. We will also seek to make use of bilateral critical mineral agreements with international partners to foster supply chain collaboration, and open and expand markets for UK industry and investors.

The Trade Strategy outlined our strengthened approach to trade defence, ensuring we can guard UK businesses – and the critical minerals sector – against an increasingly turbulent trading environment. This includes introducing new legislation to expand our powers to raise tariffs in response to unfair trading practices.

As announced in the Industrial Strategy, the new Supply Chain Centre, will help identify and mitigate supply chain risks for UK companies in the critical minerals sector. The Supply Chain Centre will undertake data-driven, business-informed reviews of critical supply chains to identify actions needed to ensure resilience. We will also introduce legislation to expand our powers to respond to unfair trade practices, and guard against global turbulence in critical sectors.

Reinforcing multilateral engagement

Our bilateral international growth partnerships will complement the UK’s existing and well established participation in multilateral initiatives. We will leverage similar finance, trade policy and partnership tools where possible to build global resilience in critical mineral supply chains.

The UK will continue working multilaterally through international forums, including the G20, G7, World Trade Organization (WTO), NATO and the IEA. We will work alongside the respective presidencies to ensure that action in the G20 and G7 focuses on delivering genuine changes that seek to improve global supply chain resilience, diversification and sustainability. The UK will leverage its international equities, expertise, UK capital markets, emerging market relationships and public-private partnerships to increase coherence in international critical mineral systems and build distributed growth partnerships to counterbalance dominant national interests.

We will promote projects and markets that meet internationally recognised responsible business practices and standards. This includes building the capacity in resource-rich countries to meet these standards in the long term.

The UK: a centre of mining finance, trading and services

The UK uniquely offers access to vibrant capital markets, world-class commodity exchanges, standards bodies, investment funds and a full suite of professional services. These will be instrumental in realising our domestic and international critical minerals ambitions.

Together, these UK strengths can play a crucial role in mobilising the capital needed to develop diverse and resilient critical minerals supply chains around the world that better serve UK industry and support our international partners’ mining sectors.

Around $580 billion (US dollars) in capital investments will be required globally by 2040 to develop new critical minerals mines under the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), according to the IEA Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2024. However, the international market for critical minerals features structural imbalances due to the concentration of existing supply chains in a small number of markets. The resultant price opacity undermines private capital’s appetite to invest in critical minerals projects around the world, including in the UK.

The UK, with its expertise in financial services, is well positioned to facilitate solutions to these challenges by mobilising investment where it is most needed. Domestically, we will work to ensure that UK projects have the financing they need to reach production and offtake positions and that viable late-stage projects receive the funding they need to reach production. Internationally, we will promote the UK as a market for raising capital for global projects, while working to leverage UK financial services strengths to tackle collective critical minerals market challenges.

To mobilise investment both domestically and internationally, we will focus on facilitating the following:

promoting the UK’s capital markets to attract investment into critical minerals supply chains

providing access to capital

strengthening the international market for sustainable critical minerals

Promoting the UK’s vibrant capital markets

The UK’s capital markets are some of the strongest and deepest globally, delivering capital to support high growth and innovative businesses around the world. This includes a wide range of companies involved in critical minerals production.

The LSE has a critical role in developing our domestic projects and mobilising financing for projects internationally, contributing to the development of resilient and sustainable supply chains. The UK’s 2 growth markets – Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and Aquis Growth Market – are particularly relevant for smaller companies operating across the critical minerals value chain and are seeking to raise investment to advance their projects to commercialisation. AIM is the largest growth market in Europe: over the past 5 years, more than 50% of all capital raised on European growth markets was raised on AIM.

We will take advantage of the opportunities offered by ongoing capital markets reforms delivered by HM Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to encourage companies with projects operating across the critical minerals supply chain to choose London as a venue to raise capital. This includes overhauling the UK Prospectus regime, as well as legislating for an innovative new type of stock exchange for trading private company shares. These will complement the new UK Listing Rules, providing more flexibility to firms and founders raising capital on UK markets.

Providing access to capital

There are many sources of capital in the UK, and these include the public equity market, institutional investors, capital funds, private equity, family offices, pension funds, government grants and more. Overlaying these sources are the variety of instruments that can be used to secure capital. Some midstream projects and many junior mineral companies are often small with leadership teams that are mining and technically focused, making navigating capital markets time consuming and inefficient.

The UK has world-leading service companies that can assist businesses to source funding, trade minerals, and operate. This includes legal services, banking, insurance, market analysis and commodity tracking, feasibility, engineering and design. We will promote these UK capabilities both domestically and overseas, alongside the benefits of new companies headquartering in the UK to access these services and other available support.

Strengthening the international market for sustainable critical minerals

The international critical minerals market is currently exposed to manipulation and non-market practices, undermining both our domestic and international ambitions. This is a global challenge, and we will work with like-minded partners to seek consensus on action to address imbalances, including in international forums like the G7 and G20.

The UK supports free market approaches. Market failures and volatility can deter investment in critical minerals supply chains. UK PuFins, including NWF and BBB are committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles. UKEF’s commitment to internationally recognised standards such as the OECD Common Approaches, International Finance Corporation and the Equator Principles, means that UKEF support helps to raise the ESG credentials of overseas projects and encourages adherence to responsibility and transparency in the projects it supports. We will promote UKEF support as a key tool to encourage investment across the critical minerals supply chain.

The UK also has world-class commodity markets, with the majority of all non-ferrous (non-iron containing) metal futures business being transacted on the LME’s platforms. Prices discovered on UK commodity markets are used as the global reference price around the world. We believe these UK strengths in commodity trading and standard setting offer critical components that will underpin solutions. We see opportunities to use these strengths to facilitate solutions to price transparency challenges and promoting price premia for sustainably sourced metals.

We will also consider wider approaches in coordination with our like-minded partners. Solutions like traceability mechanisms, long-term offtake agreements, and targeted stockpiling measures (both industry and government led) offer options to promote effective price discovery and support demand for sustainably sourced metals, but we will work to ensure that any policies deployed have a clear, tangible benefit to UK industry.

Responsible and transparent supply chains

The UK has a leading role in ensuring critical minerals are produced responsibly and transparently. Currently, some critical mineral supply chains are associated with significant ESG harms, including human rights abuses, biodiversity loss, deforestation and corruption. The government is committed to promoting improved governance, increased supply chain transparency, and greater adoption of responsible business practices that protect the local environment and surrounding communities. ESG risks also create added vulnerability to supply disruption: critical mineral supply chains are not secure unless they are also responsible and sustainable.

We also recognise that mining and processing operations take place in very different contexts across the globe, so maintaining standards is crucial. Transparent supply chains enable the UK to anticipate and mitigate external shocks. Responsible supply chains built on robust standards are resilient to sudden changes. Limited access to financial resources and technical expertise pose challenges to achieving this.

We are committed to the responsible and sustainable development of resources in the UK and encouraging due diligence in supply chains. In Cornwall, domestic critical mineral projects are exploring low-impact extraction methods, such as Direct Lithium Extraction, and innovative low-carbon processes, including using geothermal energy to power operations. We want the UK to contribute this expertise in responsible mining.

The government expects all UK companies to respect human rights, workers’ rights and the environment throughout their operations and supply chains in line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).

We will promote responsible and transparent supply chains through:

inclusive development and responsible business practices

international development finance

global initiatives and multilateral forums

Inclusive development and responsible business practices

Critical mineral production can support inclusive and sustainable economic development under the right conditions. The UK will focus on ensuring the extraction of critical minerals works for the benefit of resource-rich countries, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. We will identify where we can support local value creation, economic diversification and localise benefits through our growth partnerships. This encourages transparency in global supply networks, resulting in a secure supply of critical minerals for the UK.

Irresponsible mining practices can exacerbate geopolitical risks and social harm, including impacts on Indigenous peoples’ rights, and increase the risk of modern slavery. The UK is committed to eradicating all forms of modern slavery, forced labour and human trafficking in line with achieving Sustainable Development Goal 8.7. The UK will continue to provide international leadership on this agenda, working with multilateral partners to promote joint action to tackle modern slavery and enhance responsible business practices in critical mineral supply chains.

As announced in the Trade Strategy, the UK is reviewing its approach to responsible business conduct policy. The review will focus on the global supply chains of businesses operating in the UK, including businesses who extract, import or use critical minerals, where human rights abuses and environmental harms are more pertinent. This will cover all areas of the economy, including businesses linked to critical minerals.

In addition, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) is carrying out a National Baseline Assessment (NBA) on the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles. An NBA will contribute to the evidence base to inform the UK’s approach to tackling business related human rights abuses, including in global supply chains.

International development finance

The development of new, diverse critical mineral supply sources requires significant responsible investment. The UK’s development finance institution, British International Investment (BII), currently supports investments in the enabling infrastructure around critical mineral projects. For example, BII is invested in the Owendo Bulk Port in Gabon, which facilitates the export of locally mined manganese ore, and the import of aggregates and cement constituents. FCDO and BII continue to explore opportunities to invest more in infrastructure for critical minerals through BII’s next 5-year strategy.

Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) play a crucial role in the development and management of critical minerals, providing significant funding for projects related to the extraction and processing of critical minerals. The UK works with multilateral development banks such as the World Bank Group, supporting the delivery of the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-Chain Enhancement (RISE) Partnership to diversify and help create enabling investment environments in mineral-rich, low and middle-income countries.

Global initiatives and multilateral forums

We will promote responsible investment through the Global Clean Power Alliance (GCPA). The GCPA’s Supply Chain Mission will identify and deliver the most critical changes needed to diversify clean energy supply chains, drive investment, shorten lead times and hasten the clean energy transition at lower cost. We are developing a 2-year roadmap for the Supply Chain Mission alongside like-minded, ambitious partners, which could include support to responsible critical mineral supply chains and midstream opportunities to increase local value addition in emerging markets and developing economies.

As Chair of the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights initiative, the UK will seek to influence other governments and businesses to lower the risk of violence, conflict and human rights abuses in the extractives sector. As Chair, we will focus the impact of the Voluntary Principles at a grassroots level and aim to foster a more stable business environment while reducing the risk of human rights abuses.

The UK was the driving force behind the inception of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and continues to support their mission, working to ensure that countries benefit from a higher percentage of revenue from natural resource extraction, and encouraging robust governance systems which aid stable investment climates.

International standards can help to reduce risk in investment jurisdictions. Globally agreed technical standards, such as those developed through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), play an important role in enabling transparency and credibility of critical minerals markets. Enhancing such standards will in turn strengthen data on origins and enable consistency with ESG standards.

The UK will promote building capacity in resource-rich countries to meet these standards in the long term. We also support partners to consolidate the number of existing standards, with the ambition of raising the floor on the minimum acceptable standard of behaviour, rather than creating additional standards.

Growth minerals

To drive both government and industry efforts towards achieving Vision 2035, future demand of minerals vital to the UK economy’s growth sectors needs to be better understood. A demand forecast of key minerals required by the growth sectors provides a lens to inform proactive domestic and international initiatives across government and industry, and to support prioritisation of resources.

We are introducing a new growth minerals list to sit alongside the critical minerals identified in the 2024 Criticality Assessment, to provide an expanded focus on the current and future mineral needs in the growth sectors. The growth minerals list is accompanied by demand signals across key technologies in the growth sectors. Growth minerals and the demand forecast complement the existing critical minerals list by offering a forward-looking assessment linked to the Industrial Strategy’s growth sectors. This identifies minerals significant for the future of UK-based manufacturing across the relevant growth sectors, based on the end use of minerals in these key sectors.

The estimates will inform domestic production by identifying where secure supply of minerals is most important for the UK’s growth sectors. This approach also provides direction to our international growth partnerships, which can assess mineral-specific opportunities for collaboration. A long-term mineral forecast will signal government priorities to projects and businesses across the critical mineral industry and support the existing critical minerals list.

There is an overlap between the critical and growth minerals lists, reflecting the fact that the demand for a high number of critical minerals in the growth sectors is expecting to increase in future. Currently the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre (CMIC) assesses minerals against 2 dimensions to determine criticality:

global supply risk

UK economic vulnerability

Some growth sectors depend on minerals which are not currently assessed to be critical – this has resulted in the identification of beryllium (used in aerospace and defence), chromium (used in aerospace), copper (used across advanced manufacturing, particularly clean energy applications), uranium (used in defence and nuclear), and synthetic graphite (used in the automotive sector) as growth minerals.

The critical and growth mineral lists complement each other. Risk of global supply disruption and the UK’s vulnerability to disruption is captured by the critical minerals list on the basis of past data. Growth minerals identify the key future requirements for the UK economy’s growth sectors. Together both lists provide government with the ability to respond to global supply risk while adopting a forward-looking approach to securing critical minerals for the UK.

International partners have also been using multiple lists to help guide their approach to securing mineral supply in strategic sectors. For example, the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act of 2024 updated the EU list of critical raw materials and introduced strategic raw materials for strategic technologies such as green, digital, defence, and aerospace applications. However, we recognise the potential for lack of clarity with 2 lists and have accordingly set out the key similarities and distinctions.

What it means to be a UK growth mineral

Critical and growth minerals support

Support is available for the following critical and growth minerals:

aluminium

antimony

cobalt

gallium

germanium

graphite (natural)

We are exploring future support for these critical and growth minerals, including:

extending existing support from BBB, DRIVE35, NWF, UKEF and EA to both critical and growth minerals

up to £50 million in bespoke critical minerals support

Support for critical minerals only

Support is available for the following critical minerals:

bismuth

borates

indium

iron

magnesium

niobium

phosphorus

sodium compounds

tellurium

vanadium

zinc

Available support for these critical minerals includes:

eligibility for NWF finance for business in the critical mineral value chain

UKEF domestic critical minerals support linked to exports

UKEF critical minerals support from abroad for UK exports

eligibility for Environment Agency’s (EA) priority tracked service for early development projects

British Business Bank (BBB) support via DRIVE35 funding programme (for eligible projects)

Support for growth minerals only

Support is available for the following growth minerals:

beryllium

chromium

copper

uranium

graphite (natural and synthetic)

Available support for these growth minerals includes:

eligibility for NWF finance for business in the critical mineral value chain

eligibility for Environment Agency’s (EA) priority tracked service for early development projects

In terms of future support, we are exploring extending UKEF’s mandate to support overseas growth mineral projects for UK industry.

To secure future supply of minerals needed for the growth sectors and harness competitive advantage, we intend to align government public finance support to include these growth minerals. Alongside critical minerals projects, projects in England with growth minerals will also be able to use the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service for permitting pathway. Given the overlap between critical minerals and growth minerals, in practice this means extending eligibility across these support schemes to beryllium, chromium, copper, uranium and synthetic graphite. As a result, government efforts will be expanded to include minerals the UK anticipates needing most in future, for use within the growth sectors.

For growth minerals, we have compiled signals of expected demand up to 2035 in line with the timescale of the vision for this strategy. The signals are tailored to UK manufacturing using raw and intermediate critical minerals, to quantify the needs of the Industrial Strategy growth sectors. Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex highlights the expected rise in demand up to 2035 for selected growth minerals. These demand signals are a first step in understanding UK demand, upon which future developments can be made.

Use case for growth minerals

A deep dive into copper illustrates how the list will enable initiatives across government to secure supply of critical minerals for growth sectors.

Copper is identified as a growth mineral with the accompanying demand forecast, signalling a sharp rise in copper demand for growth sectors alongside concerns about potential copper shortfalls by 2035 . The National Wealth Fund is able to support existing and new growth mineral projects, including copper projects across the value chain. For copper projects that meet NWF’s investment criteria, NWF is able to help crowd further private investment into projects which ensure a secure supply of these minerals for the UK’s growth sectors.

Following the inclusion of copper in the growth minerals list, early-stage copper projects in England will also be able to leverage the Environment Agency’s (EA) priority tracked service for complex permitting solutions. This service will provide co-ordinated advice and support to copper projects to help avoid delays and navigate the permitting and licensing system.

UKEF will update its eligibility to include growth minerals as part of its critical minerals-focused international and domestic support to help strengthen copper supply chains for UK businesses and projects. This support will help to enable the UK to meet the expected rise in future demand and complements CMIC’s criticality assessment given copper was not deemed critical at the time of assessment based on historical data.

A summary of the methodological approach for creating demand signals on a mineral-by-mineral basis can be found in Annex 4 of the Critical Minerals technical annex. Demand estimates for Defence industry have been excluded.

Implementation

Having set out our new strategy and Vision 2035, our focus will pivot to ensuring government activities deliver on these objectives, while ensuring the strategy itself remains fit for purpose.

We will leverage the UK’s strengths and close collaboration with industry to deliver our vision of securing the UK’s critical mineral supplies for the growth-driving sectors, harnessing our competitive advantage in midstream processing and recycling. We outline a high-level implementation plan up until 2028, which we will further develop and deliver across government and with industry. Implementation of the Critical Minerals Strategy will be reviewed, typically on an annual basis, with appropriate input from industry and bodies such as the Critical Minerals Expert Committee (CMEC).

To co-ordinate effort, workstreams closely linked to the policy objectives of the strategy are identified through which to deliver progress:

international collaboration – delivering domestic security of critical minerals and contributing to global resilience through international partnerships and multilateral forums

building critical minerals security – initiatives designed to secure supply of critical minerals critical for the UK’s security, including supporting domestic production and recycling, developing a new critical mineral fund, and building resilience in defence supply chains, working with devolved governments

opening up access to finance – leveraging existing strengths and developing new and existing tools to enable critical mineral businesses and projects to access finance

critical minerals intelligence – enabling informed policymaking by continuing to develop the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre and seeking independent advice from the Critical Minerals Expert Committee

Updates on the progress made across the strategy will be provided as we undertake delivery.

Medium to longer term

Critical minerals is a rapidly evolving industry in a fast-moving geopolitical context. The government’s approach needs to remain agile to respond to market changes and state intervention across global networks. Therefore, we will consider and develop additional specific initiatives as necessary in the medium and long term to meet the objectives of the UK’s Critical Minerals Strategy, as we report on delivery progress.

We will also continue to work across government to make Vision 2035 a reality through delivery of the Industrial Strategy and its growth sector plans.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-23 12:00:43.332722

Figuring out what the next market trend is, what brands people like and don’t like, and the reasons why, involves a multitude of factors: anything from the latest marketing campaigns, to celebrity endorsements, to simply a brand’s reputation for good or poor quality. This is especially true in the automotive world, as a car is a major purchase; people are also more likely to be influenced by brand loyalty if they have consistently stuck with the same automaker over the course of years.

The world of electric vehicles, however, is a little different than the mainstream car market, although it is rapidly becoming a part of it. As the EV industry is fairly young, patterns are still emerging, and it’s difficult to predict where the market will go next. A recent study by the Global EV Alliance, the Global EV Driver Survey, has attempted to get a complete picture of what the electric vehicle world currently looks like.

One particular trend has emerged: prospecting buyers avoiding certain brands for political reasons. In this part of the survey, Tesla has emerged as the most frequently mentioned brand, with 41% of respondents saying they would avoid the brand due to politics. It’s not hard to make a connection to Tesla’ CEO, Elon Musk, who has become a highly controversial figure in recent years.

Let’s take a closer look at Tesla’s journey so far, the aftermath of its change in fortune, and some of the other findings revealed in the study.

From Hype To Cringe: How Did Tesla Ruin Its Reputation?

At the start of its journey as a brand, Tesla was synonymous with innovation and brought a great deal of excitement to the automotive world and beyond. Its cars, more like smartphones on wheels than actual vehicles, anticipated (or helped create) several of the trends that would later be seen across the car market as a whole. The seamless integration of tech and the concept of the car as a constantly connected item were futuristic, fascinating ideas: to many, Tesla represented the future of the automotive industry.

A sizable part of this image was built by Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk. In part thanks to his own personal branding as a Tony Stark-esque tech guru and entrepreneur, Musk shaped the public’s perception of the company in its early years, pushing Tesla to become a household name and a leader in the world of electric vehicles.

Over the past five years or so, however, things began to change. Musk’s activities expanded beyond the world of tech and entrepreneurship, as he began to get involved in politics. He also adopted a more confrontational, hostile, and downright bizarre online persona; after his takeover of the website now known as X, he infamously set up an auto-reply system that responded to questions from journalists with a single poop emoji.

As Musk’s personal identity and the identity of the Tesla brand were so deeply intertwined, it wasn’t long before his actions began to affect the brand’s commercial prospects. Sales began to drop, as did the company’s stock; many existing Tesla owners began to distance themselves (jokingly or seriously) from Musk as an individual.

Today, although Tesla still occupies a major role in the EV market (the Model Y is the world’s best-selling EV for 2025 so far, with the Model 3 following behind at a close second), its brand image has changed, and not for the better. This has resulted in dropping sales and stock, leading to global concerns about what the company’s future looks like.

Just Rumors Or Something More? The Possible Quest For A New CEO

Given the level of controversy now associated with the Tesla brand, you might be wondering if the company’s own management has thought about taking some sort of action to mitigate the negative impact on sales and stock. Although the idea of Tesla without Musk in the picture is unlikely to become a reality any time soon, a few months ago rumors implied that it may have been considered as a possible outcome.

In May this year, the company’s sales and profits were trending sharply downwards, as was its stock. Around this time, a report surfaced that suggested the company may be looking for new leadership. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla board members got in touch with executive search firms, with the goal of finding Tesla a new, hopefully less controversial, CEO.

Soon after the report was published, Tesla’s Chair Robyn Denholm quickly denied its contents through a public statement on X. According to her statement, the WSJ had already been informed that the contents of the report were false before its publication.

""This is absolutely false [...] The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead."" -Robyn Denholm, Tesla Chair

Musk himself denounced the contents of the report through his own statement, also on X:

""It is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the WSJ would publish a deliberately false article and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors!"" -Elon Musk, Tesla CEO

The WSJ, however, denied having been given any kind of information by Tesla regarding the report before it was published, saying that the company had been given an opportunity to provide a statement but failed to do so. It has now been six months since the publication of the report and the ensuing controversy, and although there have been no further major rumors about Musk being ousted, it might not be quite as remote a possibility as some might think.

How Existing Tesla Owners Are Distancing Themselves From Musk

Although prospective buyers and their willingness (or lack thereof) to buy a Tesla are a more pressing concern, there’s also the question of what existing Tesla owners are doing in response to the brand’s shifting image. Many Tesla drivers have taken action to publicly distance themselves from Elon Musk, with humorous bumper stickers (“I Bought This Before He Was Crazy” and the like) and even full rebadging jobs (although we’re not convinced a Toyota-branded Cybertruck is likely to fool anyone).

Some Tesla owners even sold their cars and went for a different brand instead. Singer Sheryl Crow donated the proceeds of her Tesla’s sale to charity, letting the public know about her action through social media (with the caption “My parents always said… you are who you hang out with”).

There have, unfortunately, also been some people out there (whether or not they’re Tesla owners is uncertain) who have taken things too far and into criminal territory, attacking other people’s Tesla vehicles and even burning down some of the brand’s dealerships. Though this has had no personal impact on Musk, it has affected the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people who had no personal connection to the man or his views and actions. The disturbing phenomenon shows how strong anti-Tesla sentiment can be and how, in some cases, it can end up hurting unrelated people as well.

The Global EV Driver Survey's Other Findings: What The EV Landscape Looks Like Today

The Tesla issue, and the wider phenomenon of customers avoiding brands for political reasons, was not the only aspect of the Global EV Driver Survey. The study also offers insight into several other aspects of the electric vehicle world today. Here are some of its most crucial findings.

Myths about EVs are influencing adoption rates: The study looked at the biggest barriers to EV adoption, and myths about EV emerged as the top culprit. Vehicle prices and availability of charging opportunities followed in second and third place.

Environmental concerns are a major factor: 74% of EV drivers responded “Agree” or “Strongly Agree” to the statement “I care about the environmental impact of the production of my car”. 89% did the same for the statement “Climate change is a big problem”. This suggests that concern for the environment is widespread among EV owners, and may be a major influencing factor in their choice of vehicle.

EV owners are unlikely to change their minds: the study showed most EV drivers are happy with their ownership experience and do not wish to switch to a gas-powered vehicle. 93% of respondents said if they had to replace their EV tomorrow, they would buy another EV. 98% of respondents described themselves as “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their experience of being an EV owner.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tesla-model-x-main-1.png?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-23 11:03:27.441279

The deal finalized at the COP30 conference pledges more money to help countries adapt to climate change, but lacks explicit plans to transition away from the fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas that heat the planet.

The conference didn't do as much as scientists thought the world needed. It wasn't as meaningful as activists and Indigenous people demanded. Few countries got everything they wanted. And the venue even caught fire.

But that disappointment is mixed with a few wins and the hope for countries to make more progress next year.

Here's what you need to know about the outcome.

Leaders tried to nail down specifics on fighting climate change

Leaders have been working on how to fight the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather and sea level rise, for a decade. To do that, every country had the homework of writing up their own national climate plans and then reconvened this month to see if it was enough.

Most didn't get a good grade and some haven't even turned it in.

Brazil, host of the climate conference known as COP30, was trying to get them to cooperate on the toughest issues like climate-related trade restrictions, funding for climate solutions, national climate-fighting plans and more transparency on measuring those plans' progress.

More than 80 countries tried to introduce a detailed guide to phase out fossil fuels over the next several decades. There were other to-do items on topics including deforestation, gender and farming.

Countries reached what critics called a weak compromise

Nations agreed to triple the amount of money promised to help the vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. But they will take five more years to do it. Some vulnerable island countries said they were happy about the financial support.

But the final document didn't include a road map away from fossil fuels, angering many.

After the agreement was reached, COP President André Corrêa do Lago said Brazil would take an extra step and write their own road map. Not all countries signed up to this, but those on board will meet next year to specifically talk about the fossil fuel phase out. It would not carry the same weight as something agreed to at the conference.

Also included in the package were smaller agreements on energy grids and biofuels.

Responses ranged from happy to angry

“Given what we expected, what we came out with, we were happy,” said Ilana Seid, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States.

But others felt discouraged. Heated exchanges took place during the conference’s final meeting as countries snipped at each other about the fossil fuel plan.

“I will be brutally honest: The COP and the U.N. system are not working for you. They have never really worked for you. And today, they are failing you at a historic scale,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a negotiator for Panama.

Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment and climate change minister said: “COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle.” He added: ""This is a floor, not a ceiling.”

The real outcome of this year’s climate talks will be judged on “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods,” he said.

Talks set against the Amazon rainforest

Participants experienced the Amazon’s extreme heat and humidity and heavy rains that flooded walkways. Organizers who chose Belem, on the edge of the rainforest, as the host city had intended for countries to experience firsthand what was at stake with climate change, and take bold action to stop it.

But afterward, critics said the deal shows how hard it is to find global cooperation on issues that affect everyone, most of all people in poverty, Indigenous people, women and children around the world.

“At the start of this COP, there was this high level of ambition. We started with a bang, but we ended with a whimper of disappointment,"" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Indigenous people, civil society and youth

One of the nicknames for the climate talks in Brazil was the “Indigenous peoples' COP.” Yet some in those groups said they had to fight to be heard.

Protesters from Indigenous groups twice disrupted the conference to demand a bigger seat at the table. While Indigenous people's rights weren't officially on the agenda, Taily Terena, an Indigenous woman from the Terena nation in Brazil, said so far she is happy with the text because for the first time it includes a paragraph mentioning Indigenous rights.

She supported countries speaking up on procedural issues because that’s how multilateralism works. “It’s kind of chaotic, but from our perspective, it’s kind of good that some countries have a reaction,” she said.

Tucson Electric Power’s business is built on the investments we must make to provide safe, reliable service — investments that increasingly include clean energy resources.

Between 2025 and 2027, we’re adding 340 megawatts (MW) of new solar generation and 400 MW of four-hour battery storage. The first half of that storage system came online this summer, thanks to a $350 million investment that represents the largest cost we’re seeking to recover in our pending request for new, higher rates in late 2026.

In light of all this, it’s hard to believe anyone would say TEP refuses to invest in renewable energy. Yet chronic op-ed critics keep making that claim along with an equally implausible motive: that we won’t invest in clean energy because it’s cheaper than other alternatives.

The truth is that while renewables provide great value as part of a diverse energy mix, they require more upfront investment. Wind and solar power systems cost significantly more per MW than a new natural gas power plant, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Moreover, they only provide energy part of the time, requiring utilities to build significantly more renewable capacity and pair them with storage or other resources to produce output that’s comparable to conventional generation.

A recent example: When TEP considered the best ways to replace two units at our coal-fired Springerville Generating Station, we determined that doing so with a new 750-MW natural gas-fired unit would cost about $1.5 billion. Providing comparable output with renewables would have required a 1,225 MW solar array plus 1,255 MW of four-hour battery storage at an eye-watering cost of $4.5 billion.

We ended up choosing a third option — converting the coal-fired units to run on natural gas — with much lower capital costs: about $200 million. In addition to promoting affordability, this option preserves local jobs and will help us maintain top-tier reliability.

Real-world energy needs typically aren’t considered in levelized cost comparisons that show renewables are cheaper than conventional alternatives. We don’t need to buy fuel for solar arrays and wind farms, helping to make their output affordable — but only when it’s available. That’s why TEP is working to integrate them with other, more reliable options that let us leverage their value.

The truth is that TEP needs a balanced energy mix to serve customers’ diverse energy needs. In more than 130 years of service, we’ve learned that clean and conventional energy resources work better together as part of an “all of the above” approach. It’s the best way to preserve reliable, affordable service as we work toward our environmental goals, including net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs acknowledged TEP’s clean energy leadership earlier this month at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for our new battery storage system, named Roadrunner Reserve. “Tucson Electric Power has been an outstanding partner in making sure that Arizonans have the power that they need,” the governor said, “and the Roadrunner Reserve system is a prime example of their leadership and commitment to our shared future.”

We know these facts don’t sit comfortably with some folks who think “corporate utility” sounds like an insult. Critics on this page prefer a cartoonish vision of utilities represented by Mr. Burns from “The Simpsons,” the boss of a nuclear power plant who once hatched a scheme to block the sun. In reality, though, TEP is working to make the most of Southern Arizona’s abundant solar resource as part of a balanced energy mix that provides affordability and reliability for our customers.

Nissan needs to keep going, but they also need to stop?

I am supposed to explain my “love” for Mitsubishi.

This week’s first question comes from a Nissan fan who has a few issues where the automaker’s design direction is headed.

Q: RE:Nathan! Nissan needs to cease and desist from over-styling their SUVs!

Do you remember when you did that Pathfinder video with your gold one, the R51? I loved it and I was grateful that Nissan began to bring the Pathfinder back to a more off road feel. Then I saw the 2026 model and I became very upset. They made it look like a Rogue. It is all squinted and weak. I can’t believe that when they desperately need to sell more models, Nissan makes their vehicles look worse and worse! I want them to succeeded and they keep letting me down.

It’s been 10 years since I bought my Frontier and it is still running strong. I even brought it all the out to California for the Overland Expo. You commented on it which I am grateful for. But even my brother’s Titan still runs strong and looks good. Nissan has lost their way and I am so worried that they will ruin the new X-Terra when it comes out.

I want them to do better, and I want them to STOP!

— Luca N

A: Yes, I am not sure where they are going with their new design ethos.

I’m not exactly sure where Nissan is heading. The front end styling seems to work with vehicles like the new Leaf. It’s slick and aero-friendly. I am a bit confused by the images of the new Pathfinder, but that may change in person. Yes, it does look a lot like the Rogue.

The R51 Pathfinder is a body-on-frame Nissan SUV produced from 2004 to 2012, built on the F-Alpha platform. It came with a choice of engines, including a 4.0L V6 – which was in mine. The Pathfinder once represented a serious, body-on-frame small truck-based SUV that competed on a high level. In time, it evolved into (what many consider to be) a front-wheel drive station wagon with a CVT and soft styling. A few years back, they remade the Pathfinder, bringing it closer to its roots, and it was a bit more aggressive in terms of styling. Recently, they released photos of its newest Pathfinder, and it has moved paste the beefier look, and have adopted a nose that fits their current design language.

Here’s what’s going on, and why the design language feels both familiar and a little confusing:

1. The “Aero-First” Front-End Direction

Nissan’s newer EVs, like the Leaf and the Ariya, are clearly leaning into a smoother, more sealed-off, aerodynamic nose. That look works on EVs because:

They don’t need a traditional grille.

The slippery shape helps boost range.

The minimalistic front end fits the EV vibe.

So on something like the new Leaf, it fits naturally.

2. The Pathfinder’s New Look… and Why It Feels “Rogue-ish”

The Pathfinder adopting this cleaner, more curved front-end design is what throws people off. Traditionally, Pathfinder leaned boxy, rugged, squared-off, especially after the last redesign. The new one in photos:

Has softer edges

Shares a lot of lighting and grille cues with the Rogue

Doesn’t immediately scream “three-row adventure SUV”

That creates a visual overlap in the lineup—suddenly the Rogue, Murano, and Pathfinder look like they came from the same stencil.

In person, proportions usually fix some of that confusion, so you might indeed see it differently when you stand next to one. Photos flatten out the nose and make the vehicles look more similar than they are.

3. Nissan’s Current Design Strategy (as it appears from the outside)

It looks like they’re trying to:

Unify the brand look (like Hyundai did with the pixel theme, or BMW with… whatever those grilles are)

Transition more models toward EV-like aero styling even if they’re not EVs

Simplify surfaces because clean design ages better

Reduce aggressive shaping, which seems to be falling out of favor

The result?

Some models look sleek and modern… and others start to blend together.

4. Where the Confusion Comes From

Nissan used to have very distinct visual personalities across models:

Frontier looked different from Pathfinder

Pathfinder looked different from Rogue

Altima looked different from Maxima

Now the faces, lighting signatures, and surfacing are getting closer together. Good for brand identity… But not great for enthusiasts who like each model to stand apart.

The last question comes from Facebook (@NathanAdlenJournalist), and it’s coming from a fan who is looking at two pricey electric pickup trucks.

Q: (Via: Nathan Adlen Journalist Facebook) RE: Why do you love Mitsubishi so much?

I heard from a few in your industry that you are a diehard Mitsubishi fanboy. Why?!

— JB788

A: It’s a bit of an exaggeration.

Or, I guess you could say it’s a bit of a misunderstanding. It is true that I do have a little bit of a Mitsubishi Montero fetish, but that’s strictly based on that particular SUV. You see I’ve owned one of each model, date all the way back from the mid 80s all the way to a third generation Mitsubishi Montero.

Rather than convince you that they are outstanding off-road machines, and just a lot of fun to drive, I would rather point out that they have a remarkably successful race in history for the Dakar rally. Additionally, I’m not the only one who thinks that the Mitsubishi Montero is something special. You would be surprised to find many Automotive journalist own one. Or have owned one and lament selling them.

Well, I own another one in the future? There is a good chance that I will, or something similar. I really do like the old off-road from the 80s and 90s that were offered from Japan. Some of them are remarkably flexible, fairly efficient and a lot of fun to modify. We’ll see what happens in the future, but I can assure you that the rumors of my undying love for the auto maker are slightly exaggerated.

Thanks for the question

The oil industry, free market folks they are, oppose such choice. Like the horse and buggy industry being outraged by the advent of the automobile, the oil industry remains adamant that there are actually 11 commandments, with the 11th being they should have sole control of what goes in our vehicles.

MORE: Aberdeen Insider letters to the editor, guest column policy

The American Fuel and Chemical Manufacturers has been consistent in its disdain for ethanol. It’s used hundreds of lobbyists and billions in profits to thwart ethanol at every turn, most recently getting 27 members of the U.S. House to write a letter to leadership citing concerns that ethanol could “disadvantage the U.S. refining sector.”

That comes on the heels of the American Petroleum Institute reneging its support for 15% ethanol blend and setting conditions to reconsider support. Those conditions, of course, are to continue to gut the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The oil industry continues to push the narrative that the RFS is only about energy security and how we produce so much oil that the standards are obsolete. The reality is that it is an environmental program with roots all the way back to the Clean Air Act when oxygenates like ethanol were required to get the cancer-causing, smog-forming, deadly compounds refiners use for octane out of gasoline.

Those requirements remain on the books. The single highest value of ethanol is as clean octane replacing toxic carcinogenic aromatics. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel to George Bush, was a key architect of the Clean Air Act and was often asked why he supported ethanol. His answer was direct.

“Because it saves lives.”

The natural question is why we haven’t addressed this, and the answer is simple. Our leaders in the ethanol industry have failed us. Our leaders in the agricultural industries have failed us. Our leaders in Congress have failed us.

We beg with hat in hand to be “allowed” to add more than 10% ethanol, while the oil industry poisons that same gasoline with 25% or more toxics, contributing to everything from respiratory diseases to neurological ailments.

Why aren’t the ethanol and corn industries suing the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to enact non-discretionary toxic controls? Are they afraid of the oil industry they sell to — the same oil industry that is slowly ensuring ethanol remains a bit player in the fuel mix?

Could it be a backroom deal was struck that the oil industry would give its blessing to E15 if the ethanol industry would not go after aromatics?

MORE: Rick Young: The myth of freedom in a rigged system

Spare us any talk that Donald Trump loves farmers and will support ethanol. Anyone who has ever spent five minutes in Washington understands if Trump really supported ethanol, E15 would have been in the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One phone call from him and it would be done.

We are on our own if we want to save our farmers and have any hope of growing the ethanol industry. While exports have been a welcome addition to the portfolio, enforcing toxic controls with an E30 program here at home would double corn demand and bring aromatics down to minuscule levels.

Ethanol producers and corn growers need to sue the EPA to enforce the law. The South Dakota Farmers Union represents family farmers, and, even with modest resources, has waged this battle for years. We have the data, but have never had the support of national organizations with multimillion dollar budgets who could easily take on the fight.

While American LNG vendors have enjoyed robust sales to Europe, recent trends suggest that this Euro-centric focus may not be sustainable in the long term. With European nations increasingly turning to renewable energy sources and reducing their dependency on fossil fuels, U.S. exporters face the dual challenge of finding new markets and competing with established players like Qatar and Australia. The coming years will test the adaptability and strategic foresight of the U.S. LNG industry as it navigates these changing dynamics.

Challenges of a Euro-Centric Strategy

Europe has been a cornerstone of the U.S. LNG export market, accounting for two-thirds of American shipments in 2025. This reliance on Europe began in earnest following the geopolitical upheaval of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which prompted European countries to seek alternatives to Russian gas. However, this heavy focus on Europe now poses risks. As the continent accelerates its transition to renewable energy and enhances energy efficiency, its LNG demand is predicted to decline. The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10% reduction in European Union gas demand by 2035.

U.S. exporters must therefore reassess their strategies to maintain growth. Current trends indicate that the European market will not provide the same level of demand in the future. The shift towards renewables is a logical step for Europe in its quest for energy independence and sustainability, but it leaves American LNG vendors at a crossroads. The question remains: can U.S. exporters find equally lucrative markets elsewhere?

Exploring New Markets Amidst Stiff Competition

As European demand wanes, U.S. LNG exporters are eyeing Asia, the world’s largest LNG importing region. However, penetrating this market is fraught with challenges. Qatar and Australia already dominate Asian LNG imports, bolstered by shorter shipping routes to key consumers like Japan, China, and India. In contrast, U.S. shipments must travel longer distances, incurring higher transit costs and longer delivery times. For example, a journey from Sabine Pass, Louisiana, to India takes more than 30 days, doubling the trip time compared to European destinations and increasing costs.

To compete, U.S. exporters must offer more attractive pricing, which could further erode profit margins. Currently, only 8% of U.S. LNG reaches the top five Asian importers, highlighting the uphill battle American vendors face. The necessity to lower prices while managing rising transit expenses poses a significant financial challenge, potentially impacting the creditworthiness of those in the industry.

Potential Trade Tensions and Geopolitical Implications

The U.S. push into Asian markets may also stir geopolitical tensions. Qatar, for instance, heavily relies on LNG exports for national revenue and has plans to expand its export volumes. Aggressive U.S. maneuvers to capture Asian market share could disrupt these plans and strain diplomatic relations. Moreover, Qatar’s commitment to invest in U.S. LNG facilities may be jeopardized if American expansion efforts threaten its market position.

Other countries like Canada, Russia, and Mozambique are also gearing up to increase their LNG exports, intensifying the competition the U.S. faces in securing new markets.

This crowded field means that U.S. exporters are not only competing with existing players but also with emerging ones that are eager to claim their slice of the pie. The strategic choices made by U.S. LNG companies in navigating these relationships will have far-reaching consequences for the global energy trade landscape.

Economic Considerations and Future Prospects

In light of these challenges, U.S. LNG exporters must carefully evaluate their economic strategies. The financial viability of expanding into new markets hinges on balancing competitive pricing with profitability. The increased cost of shipping to distant regions and the necessity to offer competitive prices are significant hurdles. Moreover, selling to markets with less robust credit profiles than Europe adds an element of financial risk.

Region U.S. Market Share (%) Comparison to Other Exporters Top 5 LNG Importers 8% Low compared to Qatar and Australia Next 5 Largest Importers 44% Higher market share

Despite these challenges, the potential rewards of successfully tapping into Asian markets are substantial. However, U.S. exporters must remain nimble and innovative in their approach, leveraging technological advancements and strategic partnerships to enhance competitiveness. The future of U.S. LNG dominance will depend on how effectively the industry can adapt to these shifting global dynamics. Will American LNG vendors rise to the occasion and secure their place in an increasingly competitive global market?

This move marks a strategic pivot and sharpens its focus on Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing operations.

Hut 8’s latest move to divest its Ontario power plants and sharpen its Bitcoin mining focus has put a spotlight on its recent share price swings. The company’s 32.5% one-year total shareholder return hints at improving long-term momentum, even as the past month’s 27.9% share price pullback follows a stellar 56.9% year-to-date run and strong 46.4% gain over the last quarter.

If you’re tracking the shake-ups in tech and crypto-exposed names, it’s a great moment to see the full list of innovation leaders with our .

But with Hut 8’s renewed focus and a share price still well below analyst targets, is this the moment to catch an undervalued disruptor, or is the market already factoring in all the future gains?

Most Popular Narrative: 38.7% Undervalued

Hut 8’s last close of $34.34 sits well below the narrative’s fair value, indicating major upside according to the most closely followed analysis. The narrative’s bullish stance is rooted in Hut 8’s evolving business model and future platform scale.

The Power First strategy, featuring sizable pipeline origination (10.8 GW under diligence; 3.1 GW under exclusivity) and dual-purpose sites for both Bitcoin mining and AI compute, provides scalability and flexibility to benefit from rising institutional adoption of digital assets and accelerating demand for clean energy-powered blockchain infrastructure. This is expected to bolster future revenue and earnings growth.

Hungry for the inside logic? This narrative’s valuation hinges on exceptionally bold projections for both top-line expansion and margin transformation. Analysts are banking on a business pivot and a massive operational leap driving revenue to new heights. Find out the hidden assumptions and aggressive forecasts behind the most optimistic price target Hut 8 has seen to date.

Result: Fair Value of $56 (UNDERVALUED)

However, Hut 8’s heavy dependence on Bitcoin pricing and significant exposure to regulatory shifts around natural gas remain major risks that could derail these optimistic forecasts.

Another View: A Look Through Market Ratios

Taking a step back from the narrative-driven valuation, market ratios paint a less optimistic picture. Hut 8 trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.2x, which is comfortably below the US Software sector’s 28.8x but above its own fair ratio of 11.7x. This gap suggests the market may be pricing in more future growth than fundamentals currently support, introducing valuation risk alongside opportunity. Do market multiples reveal a cautionary tale, or is it a springboard for further upside?

""Faster EV charging is around the corner,"" Singh wrote.","One of the country's leading electric vehicle charging station operators is partnering with a power management specialist to connect ports to direct current grids, making a 10-minute recharge a reality, according to USA Today.

It's ""a major innovation,"" ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said.

It's energizing news for America's EV sector from a company that already has a million places to charge in North America and Europe. ChargePoint's network has powered 17 billion electric miles, according to the California-based business.

Now, Ireland-based Eaton is helping ChargePoint add high-wattage and efficient stations that are directly connected to the grid, providing DC fast charging akin to Tesla's Supercharger network but even faster, according to the newspaper. Superchargers can provide 200 miles in about 15 minutes, for reference.

""The United States may even catch up to China's record EV charging time of five minutes for a partial recharge,"" USA Today's Charles Singh wrote.

Home charging remains the cheapest option, according to Qmerit. It's a trusted resource that can help you compare quotes for Level 2 chargers and installation.

Level 2 units can juice 25 miles an hour, which is great for overnight power-ups at home when motorists can reap lower-cost electricity rates during off-peak times, Qmerit reported.

The company added that home charging can save hundreds to thousands of dollars a year compared to gas fueling. Motorists can save money using faster public chargers, too, but the amount is less and can vanish, depending on utility rates and other factors. A standard wall outlet is the slowest method, providing about five miles an hour.

A robust network of fast options is crucial for long trips, and Wilmer said ChargePoint's upgrades will provide smaller, faster, money-saving chargers that are more efficient, according to USA Today.

Ionna is another effort by a partnership of eight automakers working to add thousands of stations across the country in coming years. Experts in India are developing a universal charger that can work with a variety of voltages, as another example of a charging innovation.

For their part, U.S. EV sales hit an all-time high of 438,000 in the third quarter as customers rushed to take advantage of $7,500 in tax breaks that expired in September, according to Cox Automotive. Cox added that sales will be more challenging without the perks, though certain states still offer lucrative incentives for buying and charging EVs.

EV owners also enjoy around $1,500 a year in fuel and maintenance savings with no more pesky oil changes. Home solar adds to the benefits by providing free sun energy to charge the rides. The Cool Down's trusted Solar Explorer has partners that can help you compare quotes, find an installer, and secure tax breaks that can save up to $10,000. Those tax credits expire Dec. 31.

That's in addition to preventing thousands of pounds of planet-warming air pollution when replacing a dirty fuel-burning ride, according to the Department of Energy. The fumes are linked by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to lung, heart, and other health risks.

As for fast public charging, USA Today reported that ChargePoint expects to start delivering the upgraded components next year.

This shift comes amid rising U.S. shale oil production costs and a seeming scarcity of profitable drilling locations. Key players in the industry are making strategic moves, including Calgary-based Baytex Energy Corp. and Denver-based Ovintiv Inc., indicating a potential pivot towards Canadian resources. This article delves into the implications of these developments and examines the factors driving U.S. interest in Canada’s oil and gas sector.

U.S. Companies Make Strategic Canadian Moves

In recent weeks, significant transactions in the Canadian oilpatch have caught the attention of U.S. energy producers. Baytex Energy Corp. announced its decision to sell its U.S. shale operations for $3.25 billion, signaling a strategic shift back to its Canadian roots. The move is part of a broader trend observed among energy companies rebalancing their portfolios to capitalize on Canadian resources. This shift is exemplified by Ovintiv Inc.’s $3.8 billion acquisition of NuVista Energy Ltd., marking its second major Montney purchase in two years.

According to industry experts, these acquisitions reflect a strategic realignment. Jeremy McCrea, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, suggests that companies like Ovintiv are finding more value and potential for growth in Canadian assets compared to their U.S. counterparts. The promise of higher returns and better deals north of the border is appealing to companies operating in both countries. As U.S. producers face increasing operational costs and limited drilling opportunities, Canada’s competitive advantages are becoming more attractive.

Canada’s Appeal: Inventory and Profitability

The resurgence of interest in Canadian energy assets is not without reason. Canada’s oil and gas sector offers significant advantages in terms of drilling inventory and well profitability. Regions like the Montney and the Duvernay have become focal points for U.S. producers seeking more sustainable and cost-effective operations. Unlike many U.S. shale regions, these Canadian plays feature wells with slower decline rates and reduced capital requirements for maintenance.

Scott Barron from TD Securities highlights the growing interest among U.S. producers in Canadian opportunities. Companies are actively signing confidentiality agreements and evaluating potential acquisitions. Canada’s deep drilling inventory and attractive asset pricing relative to the U.S. make it an appealing destination for expansion. However, complexities remain, particularly regarding pipeline infrastructure and regulatory challenges. U.S. companies are conducting thorough due diligence to navigate these issues effectively.

Impact of Regulatory and Export Developments

Recent regulatory and export developments in Canada have contributed to the renewed interest from U.S. and foreign investors. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s initiatives to fast-track major resource projects have instilled confidence in the market. Additionally, the startup of LNG Canada and expanded export capacity from projects like the Trans Mountain pipeline have alleviated some investor concerns.

These infrastructure improvements are crucial for addressing the bottlenecks and capacity challenges that have historically impacted Western Canada’s energy sector. With enhanced export potential, Canadian oil and gas assets are becoming more appealing to investors seeking long-term growth. However, the market is still awaiting a significant transaction that could signal a broader shift in investment patterns.

Private Equity’s Role in the Canadian Oilpatch

U.S. private equity firms are playing a pivotal role in the resurgence of interest in Canada’s energy sector. Firms like NGP Energy Capital Management LLC and Carlyle Group Inc. have provided substantial backing for recent transactions. Cygnet Energy’s all-cash offer for Kiwetinohk Energy Corp., largely funded by these U.S. private equity backers, underscores the growing confidence in Canada’s oil and gas potential.

These private equity investments indicate a belief in the improving regulatory environment and export prospects. While U.S. producers are showing interest, the market is still anticipating a major transaction that could solidify Canada’s position as a prime destination for energy investments. As regulatory conditions continue to evolve, the role of private equity in facilitating these deals is likely to grow.

The renewed interest in Canada’s oil and gas sector from U.S. producers and investors signifies a potential shift in investment dynamics. As companies navigate regulatory complexities and pipeline infrastructure challenges, the Canadian oilpatch offers substantial opportunities for growth and profitability. Will these developments lead to a lasting transformation in North American energy investment patterns, or are we witnessing a temporary trend driven by current market conditions?

“The technology to implement the Coke Oven Rule is not available,” Trump stated in the proclamation.
The administration said the exemption will prevent supply chain disruptions affecting military hardware, construction materials, transportation, and critical infrastructure.
Trump’s energy and industrial policy has consistently leaned toward regulatory rollback, citing job preservation and national security.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald J. Trump has temporarily rolled back key federal emissions requirements on coke oven facilities, issuing a two-year exemption that the administration says is necessary to safeguard America’s steelmaking capacity, national security, and industrial resilience.

In a proclamation signed Friday, the president suspended compliance deadlines in a 2024 Environmental Protection Agency rule that imposed new hazardous-air-pollution standards on coke ovens. Metallurgical coke — a specialized fuel essential to blast furnace steelmaking — supports roughly 70 percent of all domestic steel production.

The administration argues that the EPA rule requires emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form, placing operators in an “impossible position” of attempting to engineer unproven systems on accelerated timelines. The White House said the risk of shuttered coke facilities, stalled production, and long-term damage to the steel sector justified the temporary regulatory relief.

“The technology to implement the Coke Oven Rule is not available,” Trump stated in the proclamation. “It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this exemption.”

Under the proclamation, the stationary sources identified in an accompanying annex will follow pre-2024 emissions standards for the next two years. The administration said the exemption will prevent supply chain disruptions affecting military hardware, construction materials, transportation, and critical infrastructure.

A fact sheet released by the White House emphasized that the Biden-era rule relied on monitoring and testing methods the industry cannot yet implement safely or reliably. Without relief, officials warned, the United States could face diminished steel capacity and increased reliance on foreign producers for core industrial metals.

The administration framed the move as part of a broader strategy to balance environmental protections with economic security. Trump previously issued similar delays for emissions rules affecting copper smelting, coal plants, taconite iron ore processing, and chemical manufacturers tied to defense and semiconductor production.

Trump’s energy and industrial policy has consistently leaned toward regulatory rollback, citing job preservation and national security. The proclamation notes earlier actions, including the repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, a pause on wind energy expansion, and the use of Section 232 tariffs to curb foreign steel imports.

The two-year exemption takes effect immediately, delaying compliance deadlines for all requirements identified in the proclamation’s annex.",https://i0.wp.com/www.mychesco.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54921175516_9b77c7fc0e_k.jpg?fit=735%2C400&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-23 08:59:07.926656

Big plans

The Prime Minister visited the Damlaagte and Ilikwa solar power plants in the Free State province in South Africa. The facilities were developed by Mainstream Renewable Power, in which Norway’s Aker Horizons ASA is a major shareholder. Together, These two power plants will be able to supply electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of roughly 120 000 households.

South Africa is currently highly dependent on coal, which accounts for approximately 85 % of the country’s power production.

‘Norway is an energy nation, and our knowledge and expertise are making a difference far beyond our own borders. These solar power plants are an excellent example of how Norwegian investments are being used to advance the green transition across the world. Plants such as this also create new jobs,’ said the Prime Minister.

The Damlaagte project employed more than 1 700 workers during its construction and has a permanent staff of 19 to oversee operations. Mainstream Renewable Power has developed and built 850 MW of renewable energy generation assets in South Africa and is planning to establish a further 12 GW in the coming years. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of 2.8 million households.

Public and private

‘This project demonstrates how private companies and the public sector can work together to achieve common goals. Norad provided NOK 20 million in grants for feasibility studies. This made it possible to identify and lower potential risks to companies, which facilitated realisation of the project. Norway can help to accelerate the energy transition by making profitable investments, and sharing its technology, knowledge and experience. This is an approach that we are proud to support,’ said the Prime Minister.

Norway is investing widely in renewable energy development in South Africa. Norway is supporting South Africa’s long-term plan to phase out coal, and helping to mitigate the country’s energy crisis and implement the green transition. Norwegian companies such as Scatec, Aker ASA (through Mainstream Renewable Power), Magnora, and Valinor/Norsk Renewables have won numerous tenders for projects in South Africa since 2010, including projects involving large solar power plants, wind farms and hybrid systems combining solar power and battery storage systems.

Norfund (the Norwegian investment fund for developing countries) has invested approximately NOK 5 billion in South Africa, predominantly in renewable energy efforts. These investments have helped to boost capacity, create new jobs and reduce emissions.

The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.
""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""
""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.
""Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,"" the Conservative MP said.","The government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget.

The Electric Car Grant scheme started in July as part of the move to zero emission vehicles. The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.

However, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers.

There will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars.

It is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday's Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander the told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that subsidising EV sales would support economic growth.

""This is an investment in the country's future... and the good quality manufacturing jobs associated with that,"" she said, pointing to production of the Nissan Leaf in Sunderland.

""So making sure that we are enabling people to buy a new electric vehicle if that's what they want to do, whilst also investing in charging infrastructure, it is the right long-term decision.""

All new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.

The Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.

New AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK's transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent study that the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.

EVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.

""It isn't yet clear that it's prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn't have gone ahead and bought anyway,"" David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.

The Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.

Data from Zapmap shows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.

""The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of charge points and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking,"" the government said.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was ""expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge"".

However, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028 to mirror the fuel duty that drivers of petrol and diesel cars pay.

The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.

The transport secretary did not rule out a new tax on EV drivers' road use, saying support for the transition to EVs needed to be balanced with a ""fair vehicle taxation system for all motorists"".

""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""

""We've got ageing infrastructure, motorways that were built back in the sixties and seventies,"" Alexander said.

""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.

Reeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.

Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that ""handing out £1.5bn in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry"" was ""madness"".

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.","HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.

In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.

Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbondioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.

Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.

China's trucking fleet, the world's second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and ""in other countries, it might never take off,"" he said.

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle's lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

""When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,"" Doleman said.

Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.

Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

CATL, the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering about 93,000 miles out of China's about 114,000 miles of expressways.

The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.

Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

""The rise of China's electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,"" said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.

LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the covid-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground.

Shell's 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world's largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.

China's electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group.

But Doleman views LNG as a ""transitional step"" unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.

China is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer's fleet. This will make it ""almost impossible"" for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.

A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance.

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET

Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.

Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited.

China's hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted.

In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVs to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge.

China's Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others.

In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels.

Prices of zero-emission trucks in Europe must roughly halve to become affordable alternatives to diesel, according to another study in 2024 by McKinsey.

Volvo told The Associated Press that it didn't comment on competitors but welcomed ""competition on fair terms,"" while Scania did not respond.

It was welcomed by some as a decent outcome amid fraught negotiations -- and the absence of the United States -- but dismissed as falling short by others.

Here's a round-up of key reactions:

- Lula -

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- who had staked political capital in the success of what he dubbed ""the COP of truth"" -- applauded that ""science prevailed"" and ""multilateralism won"" during the talks.

""We mobilized civil society, academia, the private sector, indigenous peoples, and social movements, making COP30 the COP with the second-highest participation in history.""

- Europe -

""We're not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to have more, to have more ambition on everything,"" EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters, while saying the deal was still ""the right direction.""

French ecological transition minister Monique Barbut was more frank: ""I couldn't call this COP a success,"" she said.

But while ""this deal won't raise our overall level of ambition,"" she said ""it doesn't disrupt any of the previous momentum"" either.

British energy secretary Ed Miliband told AFP ""that's what this COP process is like. You look over the long sweep of history -- it had delivered change.""

""Every COP has frustrations.""

- Colombia -

The president of Colombia Gustavo Petro slammed the deal's lack of plan to phase out fossil fuels, saying Colombia ""does not accept"" that the declaration ""doesn't say with clarity, as science does, that the cause of the climate crisis is fossil fuels.""

- India, South Africa, Brazil, China -

But India praised the deal as ""meaningful.""

""We fully support the (COP30) presidency and recognize the outstanding efforts of the presidency team, including spending many sleepless nights working to ensure that we leave with something meaningful from Belem,"" said a representative from India, speaking on behalf of the BASIC coalition of Brazil, South Africa, India, and China.

China meanwhile was ""happy with the outcome.""

China's Vice Minister of Ecology and Environment, Li Gao, told AFP that COP 30 would go down as ""success in a very difficult situation.""

- Less-developed countries -

Evans Njewa, who represented a group of 44 less-developed countries, said ""we didn't win on all fronts, but we got tripling adaptation finance by 2035.""

""Thanks for siding with 1.6 billion vulnerable people,"" Njewa said of the inhabitants of the African, Asian and island countries he reps. ""This was our priority, and we made it a red line.""

And the Alliance of Small Island States called the deal ""imperfect"" but still a step towards ""progress.""

- Guterres -

The head of the United Nations commended the weeks of efforts but said he understood that ""many may feel disappointed"" with the results, including Indigenous people, youth, and those now feeling the worst impacts of climate change.

""I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed,"" read a statement from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said ""the gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.""

""I will continue pushing for higher ambition and greater solidarity.""

- NGOs -

The talks also were closely watched by non-governmental organizations working in the climate sector.

The head of the World Resources Institute, Ani Dasgupta, heralded COP30 for delivering ""breakthroughs to triple adaptation finance, protect the world's forests and elevate the voices of Indigenous people like never before.""

But the formal negotiations fell short in many respects, he said, notably on the lack of a fossil fuel phaseout plan, leading to a ""weakened"" deal.

Ilan Zugman, Latin American and Caribbean director for the organization 350.org, said that ""the lack of concrete commitments in the final text of COP30 shows us who is still benefiting from the delay: the fossil fuel industry and the ultrarich, not those living the climate crisis every day.""

We focus on multiple SDGs and they form the main pillars of our sustainability strategy across E,S&G.","Aramex centres its sustainability work on its supply chain and fleet as it links global markets.

The company adopts a light-asset model, which means it relies on partners for many transport assets rather than owning them and this lets it adjust its network with less waste and lower emissions. It places climate action, renewable energy and fleet transition inside its market plans so each country team owns delivery.

Group Chief Sustainability Officer Manosij Ganguli leads this work across strategy and daily operations. His aim is to embed sustainability in every link of the chain so it supports competitiveness and resilience for Aramex and for customers.

He applies experience from the Energy Transitions Commission and the Mission Possible Partnership, where he shapes net zero pathways for aviation, shipping and road transport, as well as his earlier roles at BP, Shell and in strategy consulting.

Manosij focuses on scale. He states that “connecting the world” and “net zero by 2050” are goals that reinforce each other, so fleet and logistics choices must match both.

Aramex sets out action on fuel use, route efficiency, asset choice, circularity and ESG reporting to build a cleaner network. In this Q&A for World Sustainable Transport Day, he sets out how this delivery model works.

How is Aramex building on sustainability in the Middle East?

Aramex was founded in the Middle East, so the region is not just a geography for us; it is our beginning. The Middle East is emerging as an important global logistics hub, with increasing trade flows and substantial infrastructure investments.

At the same time, it is already vulnerable to climate risks such as extreme heat and water scarcity. This combination means a logistics company in this region cannot ignore sustainability and still claim to be a long-term player.

Our response has been to develop a sustainability strategy that complements our commercial strategy, rather than being subordinate to it.

In practice, this means setting clear climate targets and focusing on three key areas in the region.

First, decarbonising operations: we are investing in solar power at facilities in markets such as the UAE, Jordan and Egypt and improving energy efficiency in our hubs and offices.

Second, transforming our fleet: our strategy is to convert vehicles to low-emission models, introduce EVs and use sustainable fuels where they are available and viable.

Third, we are embedding circularity by reducing material use, shifting to degradable pouches and tightening our waste management systems. I also examine the regional signalling effect, which means that when a Middle East-based logistics company can expand, uphold service excellence and reduce emissions simultaneously, it sends a powerful message to the market.

It proves that the region can be a leader in sustainable logistics innovation, rather than merely being a consumer of global ideas. This is the role we envision for Aramex.

What is Aramex doing to decarbonise its journey?

When you examine logistics through an honest lens, the most significant environmental issue is clear: carbon.

Emissions from vehicles, facilities and the broader transport value chain are where we have the largest impact.

For a light-asset company like Aramex, this includes not only what we own, but also what we contract with airlines, sea lines and road partners. So, decarbonisation is not a “nice to have”; it is our core environmental priority.

We have worked on and created our new sustainability strategy which is grounded in real world data, which has since been blessed by our board.

Our new sustainability strategy commits to a significant reduction in carbon emission by 2030 and sets out a Net Zero Emission target for 2050. We will be focusing on reducing direct and indirect emissions, including the electrification and use of HVO in our owned fleet as well as switching to renewable energy deployment and purchasing renewable energy from the grid.

Further gains can be expected through the development and delivery of new green products.

The new strategy both reaffirms our dedication to transparency and accountability, while seeking to create value for the business, customers and shareholders.

What does circularity and green innovation look like for/in the Middle East?

In this region, circularity is not an abstract concept. You feel it when you design a warehouse cooling system for a 45-degree summer, or when you think about water use in a desert environment.

For a logistics company like Aramex, the circular question is straightforward: how do we move more parcels with less energy, fewer materials and less waste?

We started by mapping where our material and resource use is most intense. To give you an example of real world change - Aramex has accelerated its sustainability initiatives across global operations, driving measurable environmental, social and operational impact.

From renewable energy and fleet electrification to smart logistics and water management, Aramex’s projects demonstrate innovation, efficiency and commitment to the ESG strategy, circular economy and decarbonisation roadmap.

We have already generated 12,610,363 kWh of renewable energy in 2024, equivalent to 19% of electricity consumed and avoided 5190 tonnes of CO₂e.

Innovation here is also digital. As someone who has worked on sector roadmaps, I know that “green” and “smart” often go hand in hand.

We are using better data and optimisation tools to cut empty kilometres, improve load factors and plan smarter routes. These changes reduce emissions and fuel use and they also improve service reliability.

Over time, I envision the Middle East serving as a test bed for circular logistics models under real-world constraints.

If we can make these models work in hot, fast-growing cities with complex supply chains, they will be robust enough to scale. That is where Aramex can add value to the sector, not just to our own operations.

How is Aramex aligning with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals?

The UN Sustainable Development Goals help frame a simple question: are we solving problems in a narrow way, or are we contributing to broader economic and social resilience as well?

At Aramex, we use the SDGs as a reference point to balance climate, people, communities and governance. We focus on multiple SDGs and they form the main pillars of our sustainability strategy across E,S&G.

From a climate perspective, Climate Action (SDG 13) and Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) underpin our net zero 2050 ambition, our 2030 emissions reduction targets and our drive for renewables and energy efficiency.

For me, a credible logistics business in this region must demonstrate not only that it is creating jobs but also doing so in a way that protects and develops its people.

Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) guides our work on packaging, circularity and resource use. We also place strong emphasis on Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17).

From a sectoral view, logistics decarbonisation and circularity cannot be delivered by a single company alone.

We engage with the UN Global Compact, regional business councils, green building councils and other platforms to share our experiences and push for clear, transparent standards. Our reporting backs the SDGs.

Aramex has a long-standing track record of sustainability and integrated reporting and we are aligning with emerging standards, including IFRS.

For me, this is about discipline. If we claim to contribute to the SDGs, we must be prepared to share our numbers, identify our gaps and outline our plans.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/66cd8d3d501f8ca9b2c9980f71ddcc3c:c5e3ea60cb1b711a7d29caeb8493dd5a/mg-image-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 08:58:56.317857

His company, X-energy, is making progress on possibly becoming the first to energize a small modular nuclear reactor in the U.S. The four planned reactors are set to power a Dow Chemical facility on the Texas coast.

Sell's company has a lot to boast about. At the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Thursday, he ticked off what he sees as groundwork for his company to become a leader in the nuclear power industry, which has seen a surge of interest in recent years as political and regulatory forces have aligned behind nuclear power.

X-energy has raised $2 billion in capital. Amazon bought a 20% stake in the company in hopes of using it to power data centers, and the company is working through the federal regulatory process -- sped up thanks to a Trump administration -- to obtain approval to build reactors at the Dow Chemical site in Seadrift.

""We have a lot of really important players that bought into our story that believe in us,"" Sell said during the panel.

In Texas, enthusiasm about nuclear energy has exploded in the past three years. It enjoys bipartisan support at the Capitol and has a major cheerleader in Gov. Greg Abbott, who helped promote what became a $350 million grant program for nuclear power research and development.

X-energy has been at the forefront of the shift in attitudes toward nuclear power, playing a role in getting Abbott's attention in 2023 on an industry that has atrophied in recent decades, said Reed Clay, a former Abbott staffer and head of the advocacy group Texas Nuclear Alliance. Now, the state is working to build a supply chain for nuclear power.

For instance, the Texas A&M University System has created a nuclear proving ground at a campus in Bryan. Abilene Christian University is designing a research reactor on its campus with some funding from the state. Both are focused on small modular reactors.

The selling point behind smaller reactors is the promise of creating an industry that relies on an assembly line that builds reactors quickly and avoids the cost overruns and delays of large, legacy nuclear power plants.

Sell lives in Dallas but leads a company with major operations in Maryland and Tennessee. He said it is a foregone conclusion that a lot of nuclear power will be built in the U.S. Many energy experts view it as a national security imperative as the U.S. competes with foreign adversaries over dominance in developing power-hungry artificial intelligence.

BUT CAN TEXAS LEAD?

""How does Texas rise to the top? Same way it always does: an incredibly business-friendly environment, an incredibly rich and well-resourced talent base, people that want to live here, an educational system that produces great talent,"" Sell said in an interview. ""It's the story that has been written about Texas for the last 25 years.""

Sell added that Texas is on track to be the leader in nuclear energy.

The worry, he said, is that competitors might trip up the momentum. Support for nuclear power has increased in recent years, but the industry is susceptible to sudden shifts in public opinion when something goes wrong.

""The failure of my competitors affects me worse than their success,"" Sell said.

""There are serious players and there are less-serious players,"" he added. ""There are folks playing it for the long haul, and there are folks playing it for the near-term game.""

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc.","Policy Momentum: Federal and state policy alignment is accelerating nationwide SAF adoption

Market Opportunity: U.S. SAF market projected at $7 billion by 2030, with a $25 billion global opportunity

Strategic Investment: $350 million invested in the New Rise Reno facility, advancing America’s push to decarbonize aviation

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today commented on the expanding policy momentum supporting SAF adoption across the United States.

Momentum is building fast. Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 – scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic demand. Today, production remains below 1% of U.S. jet fuel use, underscoring both the urgency and the scale of the opportunity.

The U.S. SAF market is expected to grow more than seven-fold – from approximately $860 million in 2024 to nearly $7 billion by 2030 – representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~47%. Globally, the SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons over the same period.

At the state level, momentum is accelerating in parallel. California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted low-carbon fuel standards that include SAF, and five additional states are advancing similar frameworks. Collectively, these states represent nearly 40% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, creating a rapidly expanding incentive landscape for SAF deployment.

“Policy momentum is transforming aspiration into execution,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. “The U.S. is making it clear that sustainable aviation fuel is essential to the future of aviation. With supportive federal and state frameworks, airlines and energy companies can move beyond pilot programs and commit to long-term, scalable decarbonization strategies. At XCF, we’re building one of America’s leading SAF platforms – designed to scale production, strengthen domestic supply chains, and meet the growing demand for home-grown, low-carbon fuels.”

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF’s flagship New Rise Reno facility. The company is advancing a project pipeline of three additional sites. The second facility, New Rise Reno 2, located adjacent to the existing site, will share utilities and logistics infrastructure to maximize efficiencies. XCF expects construction to begin in 2026 and operations from 2028, following an additional $300 million investment that is expected to double production capacity to ~80 million gallons per year.

As global demand accelerates, the U.S. has an opportunity to not only meet its own decarbonization goals but also to become a leading exporter of low-carbon fuels. Expanding domestic SAF production supports the Make More in America Initiative, creates high-tech, clean-energy jobs, and strengthens the nation’s competitiveness in the global energy transition.

“America’s aviation industry has always thrived on innovation,” Cooper continued. “With clear policy alignment and accelerating demand, the U.S. has a generational opportunity to lead the world in sustainable aviation. XCF is committed to turning that opportunity into action – transforming today’s policy commitments into tomorrow’s progress.”

As the Trump administration methodically throws up roadblocks to slow, if not stop, carbon-free renewable solar and wind power, carbon-free nuclear appears to be the go-to idea for large amounts of power that are presumed to be needed in the future for data centers, AI and more.

Nevermind that before two new nuclear plants opened in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 — seven years late and double their original budget — there had been no new nuclear power plants in the U.S. in more than 30 years.

Now the chatter is around so-called small modular and micro-reactors — touted as easier, cheaper, and faster, leading to a public perception they are ready to be pulled off the shelf and plugged in.

But here’s the problem with that. They don’t exist yet.

Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chair Allison Macfarlane, now director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, is among those who are frustrated with the public and governmental belief about small modular reactors, also known as SMRs.

“They do think that,” she said of the public perception that small nuclear reactors are an immediate option to help meet energy needs. “A lot of the media writes about these things as if they do exist. ‘We know that they’re cheap, we know that they’re safe.’ But we don’t know anything, because they don’t exist.”

But they are in development. As of last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency dashboard listed 127 different small modular reactor designs in existence globally, with about 60% of them in active stages of research and development.

There are three reactors operating around the world that are reported to be small reactors: A floating one in Russia powering a remote Arctic region and two in China, but details about those projects have not been shared.

The SMRs are often bundled under the category of advanced nuclear energy. That advanced designation generally refers to the supposedly newer ways they are cooled, and changes to pressurization and uranium formulation common to the water-cooled light-water reactors that comprise most of the world-wide nuclear reactor fleet today.

“Advanced is rather a misnomer of a term,” Macfarlane said, echoing the views of others. “It should really be non-light-water, because ‘advanced’ suggests there’s something new here, and there isn’t anything new. Most of these technologies have been tried for 50 to 70 years.”

She said eight countries have tried to build more than 25 different versions of one of the technologies — sodium-cooled fast reactors. “No one has been able to get them to produce electricity economically, viably and reliably.”

What do we know and what don’t we know about updated nuclear power options? And how realistic are any of them — including in Connecticut?

The short answer — even the owner of the one nuclear station in Connecticut sees the challenges of building new nuclear in the state. And if those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.

The basics of nuclear power haven’t changed much in decades. It’s carbon-free. The classic units — like the 94 stations operating in the U.S. — can generate a lot of power. The two units at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station total about 2,100 megawatts. Plants can provide that power 24/7 with planned interruptions for re-fueling and maintenance. Despite a plant’s large footprint compared to similarly sized fossil fuel power, it takes up far less space than renewables such as wind and solar fields.

It’s more efficient than other forms of power, including renewables, which means nuclear doesn’t lose as high a percentage of its power as other power sources do. Some nuclear systems require a lot of water for cooling — but so do conventional power plants — leaving both vulnerable to droughts, floods and warming water, some of which are due to climate change.

But nuclear power is not renewable and its radioactive waste is not really recyclable, as some claim. Plants take a long time to build and they cost a lot of money.

Enter the notion of small nuclear power plants broadly, and SMRs specifically.

Smaller nuclear units

“I find the name SMR a little bit misleading because it should be called smaller modular reactor, because they’re still 300 megawatts,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. “This is a substantial facility, requires a lot of civil work, site excavation. So it’s not a factory-produced reactor by any stretch of the imagination.”

Buongiorno said the first one likely to be built in North America is from BWRX — a longstanding nuclear company — at the Darlington nuclear site in Canada. It’s slated for 300 megawatts.

An early-stage project in Wyoming by TerraPower, a private company founded by Bill Gates, will be 345 megawatts. In October the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, approved its environmental impact statement, the first such designation for new technology nuclear.

The federal government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, is also building what it calls an advanced nuclear SMR that uses molten-salt cooling. The unit by Kairos, a startup, is not expected to go online before 2030.

Prior to these efforts, the Biden administration had approved one new project by another startup — NuScale — for a unit in Idaho. But that plan dissolved when costs increased. A larger NuScale design was approved in May by the Trump administration.

Also in May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to speed up several aspects of nuclear development. They include adding 300 gigawatts — that’s 300,000 megawatts — of nuclear power by 2050. And they order the NRC to speed up licensing, which some see as dangerous rubber stamping. Earlier this month, Trump nominated a former executive at Westinghouse, a longtime player in the nuclear space, to the NRC.

But Buongiorno and others said, as an alternative to the SMR, there is a proven modernized reactor already available in the U.S. — the AP1000 — Westinghouse’s full-size reactor.

“It’s a great design. It’s an American design. And my personal opinion is that our best bet if we want to grow nuclear is to build more of those AP1000s,” he said. “The downside of the AP1000 and any other large reactor is it takes time to build these units, and it costs a lot of money.”

That is also the reactor used in the two new units added to Georgia’s existing Vogtle plant. But Buongiorno said it would be a mistake to judge the economics of a new big reactor like the AP1000 by the Vogtle experience. It was the first of its kind so likely to be more expensive and slower, though he admitted overall the U.S. nuclear industry does not have the greatest construction track record.

Westinghouse also hadn’t built a nuclear plant in a generation, which brings up another category of problems. The kind of skilled workforce and expertise needed to build and maintain a nuclear facility has all but vanished in the U.S., as has the supply chain that once supported nuclear construction. While the fuel supply is the same for old and new nuclear plants, there’s not enough of it and some of what is needed comes from Russia.

Then there is the question of whether SMRs and micro-reactors will be cheaper and easier to build. The answer depends on the definition of cheaper and easier, especially considering the cost per unit of power.

Ask Buongiorno if it’s cheaper: “The answer is absolutely no. We expect, actually, small, modular reactors to produce energy that will be more expensive than large reactors. This is a mathematical certainty.”

Ask Macfarlane: “It’s quite realistic — at least the light water reactor designs are realistic. The advanced designs less so.” In fact, Macfarlane has just co-written a paper on the cost question. “We conclude that economies of scale still will hold. It’s just simply cheaper to build a single, large light water reactor than 10 small ones,” she said.

Ask Jeff Semancik, the Radiation Division director at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP): “There’s a trade-off that you’re looking at between what are the upfront capital costs versus the long term cost of electricity.”

On the other hand, Buongiorno points out that investors will perceive the upfront risk as smaller.

“If the check that you need to write at the beginning of the project to build the plant is $3 billion instead of $10 billion, the risk associated with the project is significantly smaller. And that’s really the value proposition for the smaller reactors, the overall project risk, financial as well as execution. There is less to build.”

It’s generally thought the footprint for an SMR won’t be that much smaller, especially if the plan is to install several at once. Siting might be a little easier because of new safety systems that require a smaller perimeter, though factors like access to transmission lines or availability of transmission capacity could impact siting and cost.

The lower the power, the less potential radioactivity if a problem arises. There’s also less radioactive waste, though there’s still no U.S. repository to store it.

As the scale continues to shrink, Buongiorno believes his point about the cost per kilowatt hour continues to hold true. Power from microreactors would be even more expensive per unit, but they are a different animal. They are envisioned to be 10-15 megawatts, but could be as small as one megawatt. The concept is also more as a standalone system that’s not necessarily tied to the grid, so the need for transmission and distribution and its costs may be avoided even though the power itself costs more.

Their use, experts say, would be more for out-of-the-way or hard-to-access locations where connecting to a grid would be extremely expensive or even impossible and where the alternative might be diesel generators. Think remote mining camps or extreme rural Alaska without connecting highways. Or for use by the military, which the Trump executive orders specifically target. The military has a history of small reactor use in things like submarines and aircraft carriers going back decades, though the technologies are not the same as land units.

“The business model is very different. These are not grid-connected electric generators. These are co-located with their end users” Buongiorno said. “So the devil is in the detail of these things, which means it’s all going to be site- and customer-dependent.”

Microreactors are expected to be easily transportable with other needed components, but they are even less developed than SMRs. An initial testing pilot project in the U.S. is expected next summer, which may be aggressive timing, even though some of the well-known and experienced nuclear companies are looking at them. So true deployment, even if everything goes well, is still years away.

What it means for Connecticut

New nuclear is on the table here.

In the last few legislative sessions, lawmakers cleared a slight path. They lifted the state’s nuclear moratorium for the Dominion site in Waterford, which houses Millstone, thereby allowing for nuclear expansion at that location. They also established a process for municipalities to begin consideration of hosting new nuclear facilities and authorized $5 million in bond funds for DEEP to give grants for technical assistance for early site permitting.

To that end, in October DEEP announced informational sessions beginning in December to help municipalities better understand what nuclear power and its new iterations entail.

DEEP is aware of the realities of potential new nuclear power, as evidenced in this 2024 report that noted advanced nuclear technology, SMRs and more are in early stages and that “cost competitiveness has not yet been demonstrated and is unlikely to be realized unless or until such technologies move beyond ‘first of a kind’ projects and are deployed at scale.”

In other words, there’s a long way to go.

“It’s a significant amount of time that’s required to get these large projects off the ground,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, noting that a project like Revolution Wind, under construction now, first solicited proposals in 2017. “Many of the resources that we’re talking about now and planning and engaging on, we’re contemplating deployment and commercial operation timelines that are in the late 2030s. That’s not unique to nuclear.”

But Connecticut does have some unique circumstances with nuclear — some helpful, some less so.

Dykes thinks the national lack of a nuclear workforce is less of an issue here with existing training at Three Rivers Community College in partnership with Dominion, as well as the skill sets associated with the state’s large defense industry — especially submarines and their nuclear components. And she said DEEP already is responsible for nuclear safety.

On the other hand, she and others point out that a deregulated utility market like Connecticut’s could face challenges with nuclear’s expense.

“How do we create the right balance in terms of the investment approach here to making our market an attractive place to invest while not burdening ratepayers with all of the risks of cost increases?” she asked.

In the meantime, in late October, Connecticut signed on as the 12th observer state to an effort known as Advanced Nuclear First Movers, which also has 11 full state members. Its inception was several years ago through the National Association of State Energy Officials, NASEO, as an education mechanism around advanced and other new nuclear.

Now more formalized, the group is working through the variables and unknowns as states consider the various technologies in the face of state climate policies, electricity needs and costs.

Nuclear, while promising, is not a panacea, said David Terry, NASEO’s president. “It’s kind of flashy in the news right now for good reason, because people are interested. But it’s not a panacea,” he said.

And with trying to figure out what kind of power to use 30 years from now and a lead time that could be a decade, the message, he said, is to weigh the pros and cons carefully. “And, oh, by the way, if you choose the wrong thing and you choose too many of the wrong thing, you’re going to pay dearly.”

CT history

Connecticut’s nuclear history dates to the 1968 opening of the Connecticut Yankee in Haddam, which stopped producing electricity in 1996. Millstone Unit 1 began operation in 1971 and it stopped producing electricity in 1995. Units 2 and 3 — which are still running — opened in 1975 and 1986 respectively, with Unit 2 just celebrating its 50th year. Each has had its license extended, to 2035 and 2045 respectively.

The Millstone units constitute about one-third of the power generated in Connecticut and along with the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, the only other nuclear plant operating in New England, supply one-quarter to one-third of the region’s power.

The Millstone units have older technology systems that use Long Island Sound, which is literally outside their doors, for intake and discharge water. In the summer of 2012 after a very warm winter and summer, Unit 2 shut down for 12 days due to intake water temperatures that exceeded what was allowable. The NRC subsequently approved an increase in allowable water temperature and Dominion spokesperson Susan Adams said via email there have been no issues since.

That incident followed a situation in August of 2011 when water from the Sound overtopped the seawall around the plant during Tropical Storm Irene. Adams did not respond directly to the question of whether this has happened since.

The company has clear procedures in place to respond immediately to prevent any impact to operations, she said in an email. “If a storm is coming, we have in our procedures to build a 2-foot-high wall with sandbags around the doors of specific locations.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists has tracked nuclear power safety for years. The director of that effort, Ed Lyman, said climate issues such as rising water temperatures, drought that causes reduced water, flooding and more intense storms are not necessarily safety issues. “But they could be a real operational issues if it has to shut down for some period of time.” He also said plants in Europe, in particular, have had to lower power output during heat waves in recent years.

After the flooding of the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011, the U.S. looked at the flood standards for its plants. “It turns out that nearly every plant in the country, when they did these assessments, they found out that they were probably vulnerable to more severe flooding than they were designed to withstand,” Lyman said.

With the moratorium now removed for additional building on the Millstone site, there has been some chatter that, despite its proximity to the water, it might be a good location for SMRs given that transmission and interconnections are already available.

Semancik at DEEP said the effects of climate change are considered when sites are selected. “You’re required to do a meteorological, hydrological study of all the sites, including what the potential exists going forward,” he said.

While Dominion has expressed interest in SMR development, Adams noted in a lengthy written response that their focus on SMRs at the moment is at a location in Virginia.

“While we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone Power Station, Connecticut might not have the regulatory environment for one. The upfront costs for an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project,” Adams said, echoing Dykes’ concern. “However, we still plan to work with Connecticut’s policymakers on potential paths to taking advantage of SMR’s next-generation nuclear technology.”

Now what?

Buongiorno offers three thoughts on why nuclear can still be considered worthwhile.

One is that in the face of Trump administration policies that don’t advocate decarbonization, if that is a still a state goal, nuclear is the lowest carbon energy source available and it’s scalable. Another is its reliability. It can run 24/7, which means it is stable and therefore keeps the grid stable. And third is its local economic benefits. It provides high-paying permanent jobs in addition to the initial construction jobs. And a facility will pay local taxes.

But he said: “If we need more power between now and the end of 2030, then nuclear can play a fairly limited role.”

And, of course, you have to be willing to pay. “But I got news for you — you got to be willing to pay for any of the energy technology that you choose,” Buongiorno said. “There is no free lunch.”

That’s something Dykes knows all too well.

“How do you do that? What will it cost? How can you de-risk it?” the DEEP commissioner asked. “How can we make sure the costs are shared equally among those who benefit from the investment?”

Former NRC Chair Macfarlane offers a stark answer when asked whether it’s realistic to move ahead with the new reactor designs.

“I don’t think so,” she said. “It depends on what you want to do. And if you either want to A, address climate change or B, address the energy needs from AI, … it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday, and none of these technologies are available.”

She said it may be something to continue to develop and see if will work. But she said it will probably take a couple of decades to commercialize.

“To put all our treasure into nuclear right now is not very smart.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCK_4724-scaled-e1763585120220.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 11:03:09.598922
