Despite their heavy reliance on fossil fuels, all three are investing substantially in clean energy.

Texas is by far the top oil-and-gas producing and energy-consuming state in the United States. Its political leadership closely aligns with the Donald Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuel hostility to renewables. And yet, the Lone Star state produces more renewable energy and battery capacity than any other state—nearly 80% more.

Texas this year has set numerous records for renewable electrical power—in the spring, for wind generation and in June, for electricity from all renewable resources.

July saw a new high for battery storage and solar generation. Through June, wind and solar have produced 40.2% of the electricity generated for ERCOT, the grid operator serving 90% of the demand in Texas, according to the nonpartisan Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Wind power provided the largest percentage of ERCOT’s renewable generation, in ERCOT, and almost 27% of ERCOT’s total power generation in the first six months of this year, second only to gas.

‘Watch What We Do, Not What We Say‘

Texas is so bullish on renewable energy for business, not ideological reasons, that three anti-renewables bills recently failed in the infamously pro-oil, anti-progressive Texas legislature. The proposed laws would have created new obstacles for new and existing renewable power plants.

“A broad coalition of Texas stakeholders”—including oil and gas producers, power operators and some large-load customers—said the bills “could have dramatically reduced investment in the state’s rapidly growing power system,” Utility Dive reported. Instead of aligning with the Trump Administration—its favourite term for enforcing compliance with MAGA policies—Texas lawmakers instead voted “yes” for renewables—for now. That’s money talking.

The World’s Second Biggest Oil Producer Goes Solar

Saudi Arabia, the world’s second biggest oil producer, has inked plans to more than triple solar capacity from 2023 levels, commissioning five enormous solar plants in 2024 and awarding contracts for five more plants, to meet its goal of sourcing half its power from clean energy by 2030. Its target of 130 gigawatts of new renewables capacity is part of the country’s long-term economic modernization plan for new tourism, factories, and AI data centers, with far-reaching implications for global geopolitics and energy markets.

“Today, solar is the cheapest, the fastest, the simplest, and the most secure source of energy that you can install,” said Marco Arcelli, chief executive of ACWA Power, the company managing the revision of Saudi Arabia’s power grid. Developing renewable energy also frees up oil that can be sold in international markets.

The 90% drop in solar and battery costs, and 70% drop in wind costs, over the past decade continue driving these shifts, in spite of the Trump Administration’s resistance. Since the start of this year, prices for Chinese polysilicon, the building block of solar panels, are down 50% and for panels, down 40%. A recent price rise of 5%, prompted by the government’s worry about a glut, still leaves pricing for solar components—wafers, cells, and panels—well below that of the boilers, turbines, and generators required for fossil fuel power plants, let alone expensive nuclear and hydrogen. When you include the engineering expertise required to build and operate fossil fuel facilities, the bottom-line favors renewables, even in an oil giant such as Saudi Arabia.

Ethiopia Chooses Hydropower

Then there’s Ethiopia. The strategically located but impoverished country has banned imports of combustion engine cars in a drive to electrify transportation for both economic and environmental reasons. Importing fossil fuels costs Ethiopia $4.5 billion annually, and the price of gas has doubled in the past three years, while clean hydropower provides 96% of the country’s electricity.

How will this work in a country where today, one-half of its 126 million population has no access to electricity, and where power outages are frequent? One answer is the recently opened Ethiopian Grand Renaissance Dam, which will double current electricity output.

“We have massive potential in renewables,” Bareo Hassen, state minister for transport told The Guardian. He says the decision to ban imports of diesel and petrol vehicles is part of Ethiopia’s push to promote a green economy and reduce the pollution that chokes the capital during rush hour. The transport ministry wants to more than quadruple the number of EVs. That number is targeted to increase to 500,000 by 2030.

Global Renewables Investment Accelerates

These developments are taking place in an ongoing, world-wide movement to invest in clean energy. Since January, $470 billion in clean energy finance has been announced, Zero Carbon Analytics reports. Finance for onshore and offshore wind increased about 25% in the first half of 2025, topping $168 billion. “The sector still has momentum and underlying strength,” analyst Joanne Bentley-McKune said.

Even the U.S., where renewables are being punished by the Trump Administration, is seeing new records for renewables. The first half of 2025 saw 63 clean energy deals in the US worth $34 billion, versus 57 deals worth about $7 billion in the second half of 2024, KPMG reported. US developers say half of new electric capacity this year will come from solar. Over 25% of U.S. power generation in June was green, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s an increase from 18% in the same time period last year.

The Time to Act Is Now

“Rapid data center growth, a rebounding American industrial sector and residential electrification are all increasing demand for electricity at a rate not seen for decades,” the World Resources Institute reports. Heatwaves, the building of power-hungry AI data centers, and growing numbers of EVs are driving demand for more capacity in power generation. The national five-year forecast for electricity load was 5 times higher in 2024 than 2022 predictions.

“If left unaddressed, this new demand spike could increase greenhouse gas emissions, inflate consumers’ bills and make the U.S. grid less reliable,” WRI said. “Acting quickly is imperative,”—as fossil fuel-rich Texas, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia are demonstrating.

That's a quote from none other than Nissan-Renault megaboss Carlos Ghosn back in the 2010s, before his highly-publicized fall from grace and when the pioneering Nissan Leaf was still in its first generation. The Leaf seldom gets credit for what it was trying to be: an affordable, mass-market electric vehicle, priced at the same level as a comparable gas car.

That is no easy task when EV battery costs remain high, and very few carmakers are even able to pull it off today. Making a great $30,000 car is never as easy as making a great $100,000 one; add in battery power, and you're looking at a lot of red ink.

(Full Disclosure: Nissan loaned me a Leaf for a week of testing.)

I'm the third InsideEVs staffer to test the new-for-2026 Nissan Leaf. Deputy Editor Mack Hogan called it ""the perfect electric reset for a brand desperately in need of a win."" Staff Writer Suvrat Kothari called it surprisingly great, plus or minus a few annoying quirks. I'd agree with both assessments. I was genuinely shocked at how much I liked the Leaf—more than its humble specs might imply.

Those specs include a new 75 kilowatt-hour battery, 214 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque, an Android Automotive OS suite with Google Built-In, a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard plug, and up to 303 miles of range.

Then again: are those specs even really ""humble""? That actually sounds like a pretty solid modern EV setup, if I do say so myself. And especially at the Leaf's $29,990 starting price. In today's over-inflated new car market, it can be tough to find anything worth driving at $30,000 or less, let alone something electric. And yet, here's the new Leaf, doing all that and more. It also does all this with some fun colors, like my Seabreeze Blue Pearl tester.

The biggest surprise to me was just how well the thing drives. Sure, it's front-wheel-drive, a setup I don't love for EVs because all that instant electric power can lead to some prodigious torque steer. But the Leaf handles it well. It's not going to tear your face off the way a Tesla can, but it errs almost on the side of being a hot hatchback. I never once held anyone up on the highway in it.

And then there's the size. America's EV market can feel like a depressing sea of big SUVs, hefty crossovers and oversized trucks. But the Leaf remains small. It's taller overall, but not really any bigger than my gas-powered Mazda 3 hatchback, and that's a size I love because it's easy to park and live with day-to-day.

The Leaf has been somewhat derided for its odd choice of charging ports: on one side of the vehicle, a Tesla NACS plug for fast-charging only, and on the other side, a standard J1772 plug for slower, Level 2 charging only. Sure, it's a bit goofy. But it all works just fine. You charge on one side at home, most of the time, and fast-charge on the other side. I had no complaints about this setup.

As for charging, it's nothing mind-blowing with a 150-kilowatt max speed. But this is kind of a medium-sized battery, so it'll go from 10% to 80% in an estimated 35 minutes. The old Leaf would do this in 45 minutes with a smaller, 60 kWh battery. This is progress.

Want blazing-fast charging speeds? Get a more expensive car. The Leaf is in line with the new Chevy Bolt EV, and both beat the also-affordable and supposedly still-forthcoming Kia EV3 and EV4.

It also looks and feels better inside than you'd think. Sure, there are some hard plastics and clear examples of cost-cutting, like those unsightly buttons for selecting a gear. But at least in my tester's Platinum+ trim, it's not bad at all. The two-tone upholstery is nice and the dashboard accents add a premium-ish touch.

Above all, I give credit to Nissan for going with Google Built-In, which is becoming probably the best all-around EV software system you can find these days. Native Google Maps for navigation will have you not wanting to go back to anything else, that's for sure.

And Nissan deserves props for the extensive EV-related options, like its menus for charging management and scheduling. Things like showing the time to charge to 80%, or your total max charging speeds at any given battery level, or the time to achieve the optimal battery temperature for fast-charging.

This feels like an EV made by people who have done this before—because they have. That's a rare thing. I am just now starting to get that from the Volkswagen Group or General Motors. I have yet to from Toyota, at all. Honda? It's too busy copying GM's homework to even know. The Leaf makes me wonder what would've been possible if Nissan hadn't dropped the ball on EV development, until recently, anyway.

There are some caveats here, of course. That $29,990 entry price does get you a lot of range for cheap. It also means cloth seats, no Google Built-In, and no option for a battery heater, for potentially slower DC charging.

Realistically, the trim level you want is the mid-range SV+ at $34,320. My top Platinum+ tester, loaded with all the options, came in at $41,930. I have a hard time recommending it at that price, but in the mid-$30,000 range, the Leaf is kind of a steal.

I walked away from my time in the Leaf with very few complaints and a strong desire to drive one again, and soon. And if I ever wanted to pull the trigger on one someday, it won't break the bank. That's a remarkable achievement for Nissan, and great progress toward the goal of more affordable EVs for all.

Whether it will be a hit remains to be seen, of course. There's the challenge of tariffs now, since the Leaf is made in Japan. And it goes on sale in America without the aid of tax credits that would've sweetened ˆts value proposition. Even Nissan is kind of warning that its rollout could be limited to the more EV-friendly states, making it less likely to be some high-volume Tesla Model Y challenger, potentially.

But the new Nissan Leaf deserves to be a hit. And I hope the rest of the car industry follows its example. It may be hard to make a great $30,000 EV, but this certainly proves that it can be done.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal government agency that is the nation’s largest power company, in September announced it would buy electricity from 6 GW of small modular reactors (SMRs) built by NuScale, with the press release emphasizing that TVA will not take any construction risk. Southern Company said the same thing when they started building Plant Vogtle and Westinghouse went bankrupt as a result. ( Do the parties taking the risk have the resources to bear it?) We should note that the few SMRs built to date have come in wildly over budget, including NuScale’s previous effort. In short, we doubt that the SMRs will produce power at a cost less than conventional or renewable resources, but the deal does provide a test ground for a new type of reactor which might provide needed power if electricity demand rises as expected. And the builders get a form of government support that does not require explicit approval of Congress.

4. The price of oil in October dropped to $62 (Brent) and $58 (WTI). Trump’s energy policy is emphasizing the supply side: open up to leasing, drill baby, drill, but more supply without more demand means lower prices, and prices have dropped to a level that may preclude profitable drilling, in part due to weak demand and in part because our friends in the Middle East have kept up their production in order to protect market share. The administration cannot boost demand for oil or gas any more than it can boost demand for steam coal but could it exercise some muscle to persuade our friends in the Middle East to let up (“Listen MBS you want our fighter planes, then stop selling cheap oil”) but that would raise gasoline prices and push up inflation, so forget that idea.

Peter Drucker, the legendary management consultant, advised firms to direct their resources to their winning lines of business rather than to shoring up the losers. The energy business, we would argue, is in the midst of a wave of creative destruction, as new energy technologies supplant old ones. Trump’s energy policy seems to be a combination of determined opposition to new ideas and ineffective support for the old.

People respond to hope and a vision of a better future, and this is the economic opportunity of the 21st century.
“There's nothing more inspiring for me than seeing young apprentices embracing the clean energy revolution, or what's happening on Teesside with net zero.

21/10/2025

Speaking at the Institute of Sustainability and Environmental Professionals (ISEP) and Broadway Initiative’s annual reception in London, Miliband stressed that the green transition must be “fair for families today, and fair for families in the future.”

He received a rousing applause after congratulating the organisers, before hailing the “incredible diversity” of the climate movement as he addressed over 100 representatives from government, business, finance, and civil society; adding: “We are in the better-lives-today business, not just the disaster-avoidance-tomorrow business.”

""Some of our opponents want to cast us back, and say it's too expensive to act – we have to take on this story of despair,"" he continued. ""Martin Luther King Jr didn’t say ‘I have a nightmare’, he said ‘I have a dream’. People respond to hope and a vision of a better future, and this is the economic opportunity of the 21st century.

“We are the generation that has this unique responsibility and unique opportunity, and I believe in this extraordinary coalition, which is far, far wider than we might think.”

Speaking directly to business leaders, he added: “What you are doing is a brilliant antidote to that story of despair, creating jobs and showing the opportunity of the clean energy economy, because people can see what is actually happening in their local town or city.

“There's nothing more inspiring for me than seeing young apprentices embracing the clean energy revolution, or what's happening on Teesside with net zero. Bringing these tangible benefits to people is absolutely crucial.""

The event marked the publication of Sector Transition Plan guidance from the Net Zero Council, which provides a blueprint for each major sector to co-create a shared vision and pathway to net zero, supported by finance and policy frameworks.

Miliband said: “We welcome this guidance which will help businesses and investors identify what needs to be done, where investment is needed, and how we can work together to make the British people better off through homegrown, clean power.""

ISEP CEO Sarah Mukherjee MBE explained how the plans will ensure the UK is taking a “coordinated, whole-economy approach to the challenge of achieving net zero”.

She continued: “We need to focus on capacity building throughout the workforce in every sector, so we have the skills to drive the net-zero transition across the whole economy.

“Our ambition should be to weave green competences throughout the workforce and make ‘all jobs greener’ – much in the way digital skills spread across entire organisations in previous decades.

“Moreover, workers from existing sectors such as oil and gas can bring huge value in terms of their transferable skills, to ensure a just and efficient net-zero transition.”

Climate Change Committee CEO Emma Pinchbeck and Confederation of British Industry CEO Rain Newton-Smith also spoke at the event, with the latter stressing that green energy is the “greatest job creation opportunity in a generation”.

On communicating climate action with the general public, Pinchbeck told Transform: “What we're seeing in politics is people reflecting that they're worried about the cost of living; they're worried about energy prices.

“We've got to make the case to people about why we're doing this in the long run, and tie it up to things people care about. But we should do it in the least-cost, most-efficient, fairest way possible, and that's one of the reasons we say cheap electricity should be the number one target for government.""",https://www.isepglobal.org/images/favicon/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-10-21 01:17:31.359810

These funds strengthen our ability to prepare highly skilled professionals who will make a lasting difference in their communities and across Massachusetts.” Framingham State University is among the recipients of this round of Skills Capital Grants.","FRAMINGHAM — The Healey-Driscoll Administration today at Framingham State University awarded over $13,500,000 to 66 high schools, colleges, and educational or workforce organizations to expand access to hands-on learning opportunities and state-of-the-art technology in schools and colleges across Massachusetts. These grants will fund the purchase and installation of modern equipment that supports career technical education and training aligned with high-demand industries, such as advanced manufacturing, clean energy, health care, and biotechnology.

“Massachusetts leads the nation because we invest in ideas—through our schools, our colleges, and our people,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Our success in innovation and education is no accident—it’s the result of strategic investments. To stay competitive, we need to keep building the best environments for learning and research, and that’s exactly what Skills Capital Grants are doing. They’re how we prepare our students to lead and how we keep Massachusetts leading the world. Our BRIGHT Act dedicates $100 million to Skills Capital Grants to ensure that every community has access to the tools and training that drive opportunity and innovation.”

“As a proud graduate of Salem State University, I know how transformative public higher education can be when students have access to modern, engaging spaces,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “From classrooms to labs, these are the places where curiosity turns into confidence and careers. STEM Week celebrates that journey—showing students across Massachusetts that innovation starts with them. Through Skills Capital Grants, we’re continuing to invest in the environments that make that possible and ensure every student can see themselves in our state’s innovation story.”

With this new round of Skills Capital Grants, the Healey Driscoll administration has made over 90 grant awards, investing nearly $45 million in the Skills Capital Grant Program to modernize classrooms, labs, and training centers in high schools, colleges, and educational or workforce organizations statewide since 2023. The program is administered by the Workforce Skills Cabinet, which brings together Executive Office of Education, the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development, the Executive Office of Economic Development, and the Executive Office of Health and Human Services.

“STEM starts now—in every classroom, lab, and after-school program where students are encouraged to ask questions, explore, and create,” said Education Secretary Dr. Patrick Tutwiler. “The McAuliffe Center at Framingham State University is a perfect example of what Skills Capital Grants make possible—modern, engaging spaces that inspire curiosity and discovery. These grants help provide the updated spaces and tools our students deserve, ensuring that every learner in Massachusetts has the opportunity to prepare for and succeed in our innovation-driven economy.”

“The Skills Capital Grants help to ensure students and adult learners access modernized infrastructure, equipment, and technologies—critical to fueling our future talent throughout the Commonwealth’s innovation economy,” said Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Lauren Jones. “Building a strong, skilled workforce includes expanding hands-on learning opportunities and leveraging investments through these grants to empower future workers and, in turn, drive the state’s economic competitiveness.”

Today’s announcement took place at Framingham State University’s McAuliffe Center which was updated through Skills Capital Grants, where the administration officially launched STEM Week 2025 under the theme “STEM Starts Now.” The kickoff event reinforced the message that STEM learning can start at any age and plays a crucial role in shaping the Commonwealth’s innovation economy. The weeklong celebration highlights how programs like the Skills Capital Grant initiative are giving students—from early education through higher education—the tools, experiences, and confidence to pursue rewarding careers that fuel the state’s economic growth and competitiveness.

“We want students to graduate with the skills and experience needed launch their careers, and equipment is essential to that preparation,” said Commissioner of Higher Education Noe Ortega. “These investments strengthen the high-quality education that our public higher education students receive, while fueling a skilled workforce for the Commonwealth.”

“In order for students to succeed in in-demand fields, they need access to modern and engaging learning facilities,” said Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez. “These funds help make that possible and show the state’s investment in students.”

“STEM learning sparks curiosity and confidence as students discover how their skills can shape the world around them,” said Commissioner of Early Education and Care Amy Kershaw. “The Skills Capital Grants open doors to hands-on learning and provides the tools to explore, create, and imagine what’s possible.”

The Healey-Driscoll administration has been expanding access to career-connected education in a variety of ways through their Reimagining High School initiative. Governor Healey’s BRIGHT Act includes $100 million for Skills Capital grants. Over the past two and a half years, the administration has approved 49 new Career Technical Education (CTE) programs and recently opened applications for $60 million in CTE program capital grants to add over 2,000 new CTE seats. These efforts build on expansions the administration has made to Early College programs, Innovation Career Pathways, work-based learning opportunities and My Career and Academic Plan (MyCAP). Together, these efforts reflect a shared commitment to creating learning environments that strengthen Massachusetts’ talent pipeline and sustain the state’s position as a national leader in innovation and workforce readiness.

“Massachusetts didn’t become a STEM hub by accident,” said Senate President Karen E. Spilka (D-Ashland). “We got here by emphasizing education early on, investing in outstanding institutions like Framingham State University, and welcoming major industry leaders to our communities. These investments pay off with good-paying jobs for our students, a robust economy, and advances in healthcare. I’m glad the Healey-Driscoll Administration is prioritizing STEM, and proud to see these investments being made right here in MetroWest.”

“The Legislature is committed to supporting vocational and technical education for students across Massachusetts,” said Senator Jason Lewis, Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Education. “These grants will help schools and other organizations obtain the equipment they need to give students the skills and training necessary to work in high-demand industries and help prepare them for their careers.”

“We are deeply grateful to Governor Healey, Lieutenant Governor Driscoll, and the entire administration for their continued investment in public higher education,” said Framingham State University President Nancy S. Niemi. “This Skills Capital Grant will allow us to expand hands-on learning opportunities for our Nursing students through advanced simulation technology—ensuring that they graduate ready to meet the Commonwealth’s critical healthcare needs. These funds strengthen our ability to prepare highly skilled professionals who will make a lasting difference in their communities and across Massachusetts.”

Framingham State University is among the recipients of this round of Skills Capital Grants. The university’s Nursing program was awarded $155,000 to purchase advanced patient simulator equipment that will expand applied learning opportunities and strengthen clinical preparation for students. FSU’s Nursing program maintains strong partnerships with leading health care providers across the region, including Newton-Wellesley Hospital, the Mass General Brigham and UMass systems, MetroWest Medical Center, Milford Regional Medical Center, Emerson Hospital, and Boston Children’s Hospital—ensuring that students gain hands-on experience in diverse, high-quality care settings.

Tesla Investment Narrative Recap

To own Tesla shares today, you need to believe not just in the company’s vision for autonomous driving and AI-enabled mobility, but also in its ability to execute amid fierce competition and volatility in demand. This week’s record vehicle deliveries, largely fueled by customers acting before the expiry of the US$7,500 EV tax credit, provided short-term momentum but don’t materially change the biggest near-term catalyst: Tesla’s ongoing rollout of autonomous robotaxi services. The overriding risk remains whether Tesla can sustain U.S. demand as consumer incentives end and profit margins tighten.

The most relevant recent announcement is the launch of more affordable “Standard Range” Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. While this move broadens Tesla’s accessible product lineup ahead of an uncertain post-incentive market, investor reaction was muted over concerns the lower prices could pressure gross margins and signal waning pricing power, factors closely tied to Tesla’s ability to fund its AI and autonomous ambitions.

But beneath the strong sales headlines, investors should also be watching for growing debate around CEO governance and how it might impact...

Tesla's outlook anticipates $148.1 billion in revenue and $15.4 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection assumes a 16.9% annual revenue growth rate and a $9.5 billion increase in earnings from the current $5.9 billion.

The project, first envisioned for ICL’s campus in the Carondolet area in south St. Louis, was relocated to an industrial area in the north Riverfront.
So we’ll be meeting with them, we’ll be meeting with the department of energy and we’ll see where this goes,” Wagner said.
“Jobs, especially anywhere in the St. Louis city area are really important right now, so we’re going to do what we can to try to figure out if there’s another path,” Kehoe said.
The grant was announced in August 2023 by the Biden administration, funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure law.","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.—The Trump administration’s decision to pull roughly $200 million in federal grant funding for a proposed battery materials manufacturing project in North St. Louis may not be the final word on the facility.

ICL Group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing earlier this month that the Department of Energy’s decision “was made as part of a comprehensive review that led to the discontinuation of the funding eligibility for a number of projects that were previously approved for grants in the renewable energy sector and other sectors, with the objective of aligning such grants with the Congressional budget framework and, among other considerations, in response to the anticipated increase in the Project’s costs.”

The company said in the filing that it was reviewing the decision and whether to go forward with the project. It also warned investors of a possible write-off of $40 million in its financial statements. The project, first envisioned for ICL’s campus in the Carondolet area in south St. Louis, was relocated to an industrial area in the north Riverfront. It would bring 150 jobs, not including construction positions necessary to build it.

On Monday, both Congresswoman Ann Wagner and Gov. Mike Kehoe said they hoped this wasn’t the end for the project.

“We’ve just begun our discussions with the company. The company couldn’t even discuss anything with us until early this week. So we’ll be meeting with them, we’ll be meeting with the department of energy and we’ll see where this goes,” Wagner said.

“Jobs, especially anywhere in the St. Louis city area are really important right now, so we’re going to do what we can to try to figure out if there’s another path,” Kehoe said.

Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents the district where the project would be located, called the decision to pull the grant a ""slap in the face to St. Louis workers and families who were counting on good-paying jobs and new investment in our city.""

""Even if this project finds a way to move forward, the Trump administration’s message is clear: they’d rather score cheap political points by attacking clean energy than support real jobs and growth in communities like ours,” he said.

The grant was announced in August 2023 by the Biden administration, funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure law. In May, with the Trump administration in office, Energy Secretary Chris Wright brought a new policy that asked awardees to give more information about their projects and be reviewed on a case by case basis.

“Using this review process, DOE evaluated each of these awards and determined that they did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment,” a DOE statement said earlier this month, announcing the withdrawal of 321 awards totaling roughly $7.5 billion.

These actions are creating good-paying jobs for Americans, enhancing American economic power and energy security, and reducing reliance on foreign powers that don’t share our interests.
Unlike the Desert Southwest Pipeline, this project would transport refined products rather than natural gas.
If we rise to meet the energy challenges of our moment, this future is not far off.
Yet, despite the regulatory and infrastructure challenges we currently face, projects like Desert Southwest offer a blueprint for how the U.S. can achieve our energy potential.","America stands at the threshold of a new economic era, one that promises greater prosperity, security, and connectivity. Yet for communities across the Sunbelt and the nation, the energy required to power a 21st-century economy is outpacing supply, threatening a daily reality of frequent blackouts and sky-high energy prices.

At the same time, the very forces driving this strain – technology, population growth, and infrastructure – also hold the keys to America’s future. Harnessed effectively, they can create jobs, fuel economic growth, and strengthen national security. If policymakers and private-sector leaders embrace this moment with an ambitious, pro-infrastructure, all-of-the-above energy strategy, the nation can turn today’s challenges into lasting energy security and independence.

Arizona offers a window into the country’s broader energy struggles. Arizona is now home to 162 AI data centers, which place enormous demands on the state’s electric grid, far beyond what traditional infrastructure was designed to handle. The state has also seen a population boom in the last 25 years, increasing by 2.5 million people since 2000. Combined with the extreme heat of desert summers, population growth has led to increased energy demand for homes, transportation, and businesses. As if these challenges weren’t enough, electricity generators plan to retire 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in 2025. While this represents a large portion of the nation’s existing grid, replacement plans remain inadequate.

The good news is that solutions are within reach, and while new technologies may be part of the problem, they also offer exciting opportunities to unlock our nation’s energy potential. Since January, the Trump Administration has been leading the charge, easing access for American companies to produce oil and natural gas and reducing red tape to support the construction of critical energy infrastructure. President Trump also announced Stargate LLC, a $500 billion public-private partnership with leading technology companies to build the physical and digital infrastructure necessary to power next-generation artificial intelligence. These actions are creating good-paying jobs for Americans, enhancing American economic power and energy security, and reducing reliance on foreign powers that don’t share our interests.

The private sector is also stepping up. Two recently announced projects in the Sun Belt show what’s possible when companies are empowered to act. Energy Transfer’s planned expansion of the Desert Southwest Pipeline will carry natural gas from the Permian Basin to markets in the Southwest, adding 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for communities in Arizona and New Mexico with growing demand. Arizona’s two largest utility companies have already signed agreements to secure capacity from the pipeline, which will support new gas-fired power plants and reduce strain on the state’s energy grid. Though completion is not expected until 2029, construction alone will create 5,000 jobs, with Energy Transfer pledging to prioritize local and union workers.

ONEOK’s proposed Sun Belt Connector Pipeline offers another example of infrastructure investment tailored to real-world energy needs. Unlike the Desert Southwest Pipeline, this project would transport refined products rather than natural gas. When operational in 2029, it will extend from El Paso to the Phoenix area, supplying refined fuels, including jet fuel, to one of the nation’s fastest-growing transportation hubs.

Projects like Desert Southwest and the Sun Belt Connector Pipeline should not be exceptions but instead serve as models of what America can achieve with the right policies in place: creating jobs, strengthening infrastructure, and meeting the demands of a growing economy.

Far from the grim possibilities of rolling blackouts and sky-high energy prices, these energy projects help us to imagine a future where families enjoy lower energy bills, where workers find job opportunities building the infrastructure of tomorrow, and where America leads the world in both innovation and security. If we rise to meet the energy challenges of our moment, this future is not far off.

Achieving this future will take an aggressive, all-of-the-above strategy combining natural gas, oil, nuclear, renewables, and emerging technologies. Policymakers from the federal and state levels must also work together with private sector partners instead of trying to score cheap political points. Yet, despite the regulatory and infrastructure challenges we currently face, projects like Desert Southwest offer a blueprint for how the U.S. can achieve our energy potential.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_center_square_articles_912/9642bc202bc384232889e472635600be,N,,2025-10-20 22:00:18.983762

This is the view of U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar. He praised the North American Development for making the two rehabilitation projects - Colector Ribereño and the Colector Donato Guerra - happen.

NADBank is providing $8 million dollars in grants from the Bank's Border Environment Infrastructure Fund (BEIF), which is funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The money will rehabilitate the Colector Ribereño and the Colector Donato Guerra.

“This project is vital for border communities and for the downstream communities that rely on the Rio Grande. When we invest in cross-border infrastructure, we protect American families who depend on the river for drinking water,” Cuellar said.

Cuellar said he is a “strong supporter” of NADBank and the critical projects that it helps develop.

“That is why I helped increase its capital reauthorization through the USMCA and have worked, through my role on the Appropriations Committee, to secure critical federal funding for infrastructure projects along the border,” Cuellar said.

USMCA stands for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

“As a senior appropriator, I will continue to secure critical funding for projects that support our local communities,” Cuellar added.

Recently, NADBank held a groundbreaking ceremony for the rehabilitation of the Colector Ribereño and the Colector Donato Guerra wastewater sewer mains. The bank is working alongside the Municipality of Nuevo Laredo, the State of Tamaulipas, Mexico’s National Water Commission (CONAGUA), and the local water utility Comision de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Nuevo Laredo (COMAPA) on the projects.

According to COMAPA, approximately 98% of homes in its service area are connected to the wastewater collection system and consist of approximately 407 km (253 miles) of wastewater lines that mainly operate by gravity. The city also has 12 lift stations and 9.5 km (5.9 miles) of force mains to convey the sanitary sewer to the Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP).

The total project cost amounts to approximately US$81.2 million, financed through a successful combination of BEIF funds, a commercial loan of up to US$6 million and Mexican federal, state, and local funds of $52.2 million representing 64.7% of the total project cost. The International Boundary Water Commission also participated with part of the financing.

Salvador López Córdova, NADBank's chief environmental officer, said the two projects are part of a Comprehensive Wastewater Collection and Treatment Project that will benefit more than 400,000 residents.

“NADBank is proud to be part of this vital undertaking for the citywide rehabilitation of Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater system,” López said.“NADBank played a key role in structuring the infrastructure financing plan and coordinating with the different agencies that are collaborating to bring this project to reality. Over the next three years, the project will significantly reduce transboundary wastewater flows into the Rio Grande, which is essential for the long-term regional well-being & embody the very purpose for which NADBank was established.”

López said the Comprehensive Wastewater Collection and Treatment project will rehabilitate and expand the wastewater collection system for more than 120, 000 residential connections and double the treatment capacity of two of the three existing WWTPs, which will decrease system failure and prevent discharge of approximately 12.6 million gallons per day of untreated wastewater into groundwater and surface water, including the Rio Grande. The downstream communities on both sides of the border that rely on the river for their drinking water supply will also benefit.

For several years, NADBank has worked closely with the City and COMAPA in structuring the investment and financing plan for the project, López explained, providing more than US$650,000 in technical assistance, with resources from both the Bank and EPA, to support studies, assessments and preliminary designs underpinning this transformation.

Work to rehabilitate the wastewater collection system began in 2019 with investments from the municipal government and federal funding through Conagua.

In addition to López, the event included participation from Nuevo Laredo Mayor Carmen Lilia Canturosas Villareal, Tamaulipas Secretary of Water Resources for Social Development Raul Quiroga Alvarez, and CONAGUA’s Regional Director of the Río Grande watershed, Luis Carlos Alatorre, along with representatives from COMAPA.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20251020-202345-279-251020-NADBank_4.jpeg,N,,2025-10-20 22:00:09.673143

Echoing that cautious approach is the recent news that Tokyo Gas will divest its U.S. shale stake, rebalancing its focus toward its other midstream assets. The US energy market is a volatile and unpredictable environment for companies to operate in, mostly due to the fact that the current administration in the United States is as unpredictable as a toddler on a sugar rush. Tokyo Gas has selected one of its compatriots as the buyer for its U.S. shale stake.

Tokyo Gas will sell off all of its holdings in the US shale stake as the sector faces uncertainty due to Donald Trump

Since coming into office for the second time, Donald Trump has treated the American economy with about as much care as a rollercoaster maintenance technician. The market has seen significant ups and downs in recent months. But as ever, the US economy will bounce back as the largest economy in the world.

Due to the uncertain nature of the economy, many nations have opted out of the US market, citing the volatile tariffs and increasing inflation as a major contributor to the exodus.

That exodus has reached the Japanese companies operating an interest in the US energy sector. Tokyo Gas has announced, following extensive consultation with a law firm, that it is bending the knee to activist shareholder Elliott Investment Management, which has called for the company to streamline its portfolio.

Tokyo Gas will sell all of its subsidiaries’ holdings in the Eagle Ford shale gas project in Texas. The company stated that it will sell its stake to compatriot and fellow energy company, Shizuoka Gas Co., for $130 million. Tokyo Gas, which is Japan’s largest utility, has been under Elliott’s scrutiny since last year, when the company stated it held a 5% stake in Tokyo Gas.

Elliot then proceeded to insist that Tokyo Gas sell off the stake in the Eagle Ford shale gas project, instead opting to focus on assets it acquired through the purchase of Rockcliff Energy in 2023 in East Texas and North Louisiana.

Tokyo Gas consulted with a huge law firm before opting to sell its stake in the US shale industry

The company has noted that it consulted with Akin, a leading international law firm with more than 900 lawyers across the US, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Akin advised the company to sell its stake in the Eagle Ford shale gas project in South Texas.

The Akin team was led by several extensively experienced lawyers who advised the company to align with Elliott Investment Management’s mandate to sell the stake in the project. While the US energy market remains unpredictable, the UAE has invested in the midstream and downstream sectors.

Akin noted that by pulling out of the sector, Tokyo Gas can instead focus on its other assets in the US energy sector. As the company is Japan’s largest gas company, its assets are spread across a wide range of projects.

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes through a process called ""compression.""
Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire.
""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""
McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself.","Monday marks the start of early voting in Texas' Nov. 4 general election. The only statewide contests this year are ballot propositions to amend the state constitution — 17 of them, to be exact.

More than half of the constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall deal with taxation, while others pertain to bail practices, dementia research and the state’s water supply.

Arguably, the most significant measures would raise homestead exemptions. They determine how much of a home's property value can be taxed to pay for public schools.

Proposition 13 would lift the homestead exemption for all Texas homeowners from $100,000 to $140,000.

""Now that will save all those 5.7 million homeowners $484 per year,"" said Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt of Houston, author of the measure. ""Once the voters approve of a homestead exemption for schools, it follows you, no matter where you go. That $140,000 exemption means it’s whatever your primary homestead is, and it doesn’t matter if it’s year one or year 50, that’s going to be there. So that’s a substantial lifetime benefit.""

Bettencourt is also the author of Proposition 11, which would lift the additional homestead exemption for homeowners who are over age 65 or disabled from $10,000 to $60,000. In other words, if both Propositions 11 and 13 pass, those homeowners would have a homestead exemption of $200,000.

""Now you may ask, ‘Why do more for over-65 and disabled homeowners?'"" Bettencourt said. ""They’re generally on fixed income, and they need the most help staying in their home. And in the case of seniors, you [can] argue that they already paid a lifetime of taxes and probably don’t have any current students in the public education system.""

The combined benefits, and burdens, of tax breaks

Taken together with amendments to reduce property taxes passed in earlier elections, maintaining these reductions will cost the state roughly $51 billion.

“A lot of those have been funded out of surplus money, and surplus money is one-time revenue,"" said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""It’s not recurring revenue. So, when the surplus ends, you have to find another way to finance these reductions.""

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes through a process called ""compression."" But unlike the homestead exemptions, the compressions would not be written into the constitution.

""There’s a big difference between the homestead exemptions, which are constitutionally passed and so guaranteed forever, but the compressions can be taken away just like that,"" Diamond said, snapping his fingers. ""Those are not protected.""

And that could lead to deep cuts in public education funding in lean budget years, much as Texas saw 20 years ago.

Some of the other tax measures are highly targeted. Proposition 7 would provide a full or partial homestead exemption to the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a disease or medical condition related to their service. Proposition 17 would provide property tax relief for homeowners whose property has been affected by the installation or construction of border security infrastructure along the Mexican border.

Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire. That's another of Bettencourt's measures.

""And so we decided, fine, we’ll give them the same coverage that we do for tornadoes and hurricanes,"" Bettencourt said. “Because if your home’s burned down, you shouldn’t have to pay for all the whole full value.""

University of Houston economist Steven Craig said all those exemptions add up.

""Our heart can go out to all kinds of people, and then the question is, ‘Is this the way to help them, or is there a better way to help them?'"" Craig said. ""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""

Then there are a series of measures that would ban the state from collecting certain kinds of taxes altogether. Proposition 2 would ban capital gains taxes. Proposition 6 would ban taxes on securities transactions. That's ahead of Texas establishing its own stock exchange. And Proposition 8 would ban inheritance taxes.

Texas doesn't collect any of these at present, but Diamond said ruling them out limits the state's options when revenues from other sources fall.

""Sales taxes, I could definitely see those flattening out as the consumers' resilience finally fades,"" Diamond said, ""and then federal transfers almost certainly are going to fall and could fall significantly. That is a huge chunk of the Texas budget.""

Felony bail changes

At least three ballot measures that don't relate to taxation have potentially widespread ramifications for the state. Take Proposition 3, which would amend the constitution to allow judges to deny bail to people charged with certain felonies. Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman of Houston has been trying to get this passed since 2019.

""A judge would have to determine that either the person was going to be a threat in some way to the safety of the community or to law enforcement and/or a likelihood that the person would not return to court,"" Huffman said.

The amendment would apply only to the most serious offenses — capital murder, murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and continuous human trafficking.

""This doesn’t take away any of the other rights that they would have for a trial, for the state to have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Huffman said. ""It’s just reserved for those that would be held pending trial. And I will say that many states have this exact same type of system, and the federal system operates this way for violent offenders.""

Prop 3 would affect a relatively small number of cases in the Texas justice system, about 40,000 out of more than 800,000 arrests made in Texas every year. That's according to Nick Hudson, senior manager of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of Texas. But Hudson said he has serious concerns that the measure would worsen overcrowding in Texas jails.

""I think this is very likely to pass. Our focus has been on trying to mitigate the harm it will cause,"" Hudson said. “We, along with many other people and many House and Senate negotiators, worked to ensure that there was access to lawyers baked into this proposal to blunt some of the potential negative impacts. We are happy to see that provision in, but we are really concerned that this will accelerate pretrial detention.""

Hudson argued that the measure could wind up violating one of the most basic rights of the accused.

""They have not been convicted,"" Hudson said. ""They are presumed innocent [until proven guilty], waiting for trial behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of about $1.2 billion a year.""

Investments in water infrastructure and dementia prevention

One ballot measure with a similar price tag, but less controversial, is Proposition 4. This amendment would dedicate up to $1 billion per year from existing state sales tax revenue to the Texas Water Fund for the next 20 years. The money would be used to fix some of the state's most pressing water infrastructure needs.

Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation, estimated the state's total needs for new water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as to replace aging infrastructure, at $150 billion, far above the maximum of $20 billion that Prop 4 would provide.

""Is it enough? No, it’s not enough to meet everything,"" Schlessinger said. ""Is it a significant move towards funding water infrastructure in Texas? Yes, significantly so.""

Schlessinger said the total amount of money the amendment would commit is less significant than the fact that the amendment provides for a dedicated and ongoing source of funds — allowing the state to better plan for long-term needs, like combatting droughts worsening in the face of climate change.

Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at the public policy think tank Texas 2036, said Houston and other major cities have a lot riding on the passage of Prop 4.

""First, they need to expand and diversify their water supply portfolio for a dynamic, growing region,"" Mazur said. ""And second, there’s also this issue of aging, deteriorating, leaking water systems within the Houston metropolitan area that really need to be resolved sometime soon. These are systems that annoy everyday families and businesses through inadequate or leaking service, causing boil water notices or even service interruptions.""

Then there's Proposition 14, which would create a state institute for fighting dementia, formally the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT), similar to one Texas has already established to target cancer (CPRIT). The amendment would provide an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue to a fund dedicated to finding medical breakthroughs, cures and prevention.

""It would be a breakthrough,"" said Ashley McPhail, chief external affairs and administration officer at the Texas Medical Center. ""It really would make a huge difference in sort of the path and trajectory that we are on for dementia and other related diseases within this space. If you look across funding, this would be sort of the second-largest funding for something like this, for brain health outside of the [National Institutes of Health] in the United States.""

McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself. It could lure hundreds of researchers to the state and spark the creation of dozens of companies dedicated to fighting Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, much as CPRIT has done already with cancer research. And that doesn't even touch the savings in residents' medical bills.

""Currently, over 400,000 Texans are living with Alzheimer’s, which costs families over $20 billion per year,"" McPhail said. ""Texas ranks third in the nation for the number of Alzheimer’s cases and second in the number of Alzheimer’s deaths. So, the need here in Texas is also very acute and specific from that side, and I would say it’s a $3.9 billion cost for Alzheimer’s to the Texas Medicaid program every year.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a18451b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3427+0+925/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fc3%2F3a38110545b19739a953b1d4c7b2%2Felection-day-7-52486517839-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 22:00:22.623739

Any fossil fuel infrastructure built today will keep running for decades – at a time when fossil fuel use needs to taper off sharply to hold climate change under 2°C.","The price of partnership with the United States has changed. Washington is now using assurances of defence and trade access to pressure allies in Europe and Asia to buy more of its fossil fuels under decades-long contracts.

The scale is immense. The European Union intends to import up to A$1.15 trillion of US energy – mostly liquefied natural gas (LNG) – by 2028. That would be more than four times its current imports, though analysts are sceptical it will eventuate.

Indonesia has signed up for $24 billion in US energy imports and Japan is exploring a similar option.

These deals aren’t based on free trade. They represent the Trump administration’s geopolitical play using trade and security carrots and sticks to lock in long-term fossil fuel profitability and dominance. The goal: prop up energy sources facing cost pressures from clean technology, strengthen US control of the energy flows, and shut out China, the world’s top manufacturer of clean tech.

As Prime Minister Anthony Albanese meets US President Donald Trump this week, he will face pressure to boost US fortunes – complicated by the fact that Australia is itself a major LNG exporter.

(Buy) America First

For decades, the US has relied on energy imports as its own oil production slowed. But the fracking boom changed everything. By 2019, the US had gone from importer to net exporter. In 2023, it became the top LNG exporter, passing Qatar and Australia.

The Trump administration’s efforts to force its allies to buy more and more fossil fuels draws on a straightforward “America First” logic. Here are three reasons for the push:

1. Preserving business

The US now produces 22% of the world’s oil and 25% of its gas – well ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. But fossil fuels are projected to begin declining by 2030. The Trump administration wants to convert a risky commodity market facing long-term decline into a stable, decades-long “subscription model”. New gas plants or import terminals will only be viable if intended for long-term use.

2. Maintaining dominance

US dominance has long rested on control of global energy flows, both by protecting shipping lanes and by providing the currency to settle oil trades. Decentralised renewables and clean technologies such as batteries and electric vehicles weakens that grip. By tying allies to US gas, Washington wants to keep its ability to use energy as leverage.

3. Kneecapping China

China controls more than 70% of the world’s global solar, wind and battery manufacturing, positioning itself as the emerging energy superpower. Under Trump, the US has switched from competing on clean tech to defending fossil fuels, rejecting the transition and cancelling major domestic renewable projects. By forcing allies to buy gas, Washington seeks to delay the green shift and block China from gaining influence over energy. A related strategy is to vilify China over human rights abuses in its green supply chain.

Gas lock-in will cost US allies dearly

The consequences will be profound.

These unfair deals will make US allies less competitive. The main use for LNG is to burn it to produce electricity. But for almost a decade, solar and and wind have been the cheapest way to produce power, consistently outcompeting all fossil fuels.

As the cost of grid-scale batteries plummets, renewables are becoming even more competitive as daytime solar can be stored for the evening peak. Gas-dependent economies will face higher and more volatile energy costs, undermining competitiveness.

Worse, these deals threaten national security. That’s because relying on external suppliers for fuels reduces energy sovereignty. For instance, nations such as Nepal are embracing EVs to cut reliance on unreliable fossil fuel suppliers.

But the most critical issue is climate. Any fossil fuel infrastructure built today will keep running for decades – at a time when fossil fuel use needs to taper off sharply to hold climate change under 2°C. The billions spent on new LNG facilities are billions that can’t be spent on clean tech.

Australia embodies the contradiction, as a competing LNG exporter and one of the nations expected to be worst hit by climate change. The annual cost of climate-related disasters is projected to rise almost tenfold from $4.5 billion to $41 billion by 2050 – roughly the value of current gas exports. If Australia aligns with the US pro-gas agenda, it will mean favouring short-term profits for a few over national economic stability and climate security.

Which con job?

Trump last month declared climate change a “con job” in a speech at the United Nations. But this was a strategic distraction.

The real issue is his administration’s pressure on partners to sacrifice their long-term economic future and climate goals for the benefit of US fossil fuel interests.

It’s not inevitable. Asian economies and Australia can respond by accelerating their own green transitions, thereby securing cheaper power, greater energy independence and a long-term economic advantage.

Australia and Indonesia have large lithium and nickel resources, while China, Korea, Vietnam and others have the industrial might. This could anchor a regional supply chain for batteries, EVs and renewables.

Australia’s huge solar and wind potential can power large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production useful in making low-carbon iron and steel. Cross-border electricity trade would further strengthen the system.

Linking Asia’s regional grids would smooth intermittency, lower power costs and boost mutual energy security. Early steps such as Laos ramping up hydropower exports to Vietnam point to how integration can work.

America’s goals are not the world’s goals

The current US administration wants to protect fossil fuel profits, slow the clean energy transition and curb China’s influence — whatever the cost to allies or the climate.

The rational response for Asian and Australian policymakers is equally clear: reject the fossil trap and invest in the future.

Shifting decisively toward renewables will deliver cheaper power, greater energy independence and heightened resilience. It will also position the region at the forefront of the next great industrial transformation.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/697125/original/file-20251020-56-aqbauq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C4531%2C2265&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-20 19:22:47.878151

In November, the PCEF Committee will review public comment.","PCEF staff and Committee are conducting a first annual Climate Investment Plan (CIP) review to ensure the CIP remains responsive and aligned with evolving program experience, community needs and climate priorities.

This update process provides a framework for how the program can incorporate lessons learned, align outcomes and goals, and optimize resource allocation. As we are still early in this CIP period, not all programs are implemented yet. The focus in this initial update cycle is on creating a replicable framework for evaluation and making limited adjustments based on early program performance data.

Current revenue projections from the City Budget Office anticipate no additional revenue within this five-year CIP period. As a result, funding adjustments in this CIP update cycle are limited to reallocating funds among existing program areas rather than expanding overall resources.

We invite you to review the proposed updates to the CIP and share your thoughts. The comment period is open now through 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 5.

City, state and federal officials, including New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell and U.S. Congressman Bill Keating, said local organizations will receive funding for high-priority environmental projects.

The money and assistance stem from the Southeast New England Program (SNEP), which is funded by Congress and managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). SNEP aims to restore clean water, protect ecosystems and promote sustainability across Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts.

A total of $1.3 million will be divided among eight Massachusetts organizations for “large-scale environmental restoration projects” through SNEP Watershed Implementation

Grants. Another $200,000 will be distributed among 25 organizations for coastal and watershed stewardship.

One of the grants will provide $50,000 to the city of New Bedford for the restoration of a historic salt marsh at Riverside Park.

“Riverside Park is an important recreational asset in the Near North End and the lynchpin of the

Riverwalk, which is being designed now. This project will improve the park’s ecological health

and expand recreational opportunities,” Mitchell said. “I want to thank our federal

delegation for their continued support of initiatives like this.”

More than $53,000 will go toward adapting to sea level rise at Mason Street Conservation Area in Rehoboth and $105,000 will support the Cole River dam removal concept design in Swansea.

An additional $1.7 million in grants for Rhode Island organizations is scheduled to be announced at an event in Providence on Friday.

However, many of these projects have not yet submitted applications to construct the Class VI injection wells necessary for CO2storage.
It remains unclear when consideration of new Class VI permit application may resume.","Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry this week signed an Executive Order declaring a moratorium on review of new permit applications for Class VI underground injection wells in the state and directing prioritized review of several pending applications seeking to construct Class VI wells in connection with proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities across the state to proceed.

The order directs the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) to suspend review of any new applications to construct a Class VI well submitted after its effective date and to spend the next 45 days reevaluating the status of the approximately 33 pending permit applications already received. The order prioritizes review of five specified applications for CCS projects in Point Coupee, Vernon, Calcasieu, Cameron, Caldwell and Ascension parishes.

Class VI wells are one of the core components of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities, which capture and liquefy carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sources such as power generation and manufacturing plants for reuse or disposal. The construction of a Class VI well allows CCS facilities to permanently remove their captured CO2emissions from the atmosphere by injecting the liquid CO2into underground geological formations. The resulting reduction in emissions can then be used or sold in carbon markets worldwide to offset emissions increases associated with expanding industrial activities under federal and foreign air permitting regimes.

Louisiana, one of the first states to be granted authority to regulate its own Class VI injection wells by the Environmental Protection Agency in late 2023, is a particularly attractive option for proposed CCS hubs due to its close proximity to manufacturing and energy corridors across the Southeast and its favorable subsurface geology, which features deep saline aquifers and porous rock reservoirs offering ample pore space.

Gov. Landry’s order notes that some projections have found that announced CCS projects alone have the potential to generate 17,000 new jobs and $76 billion dollars in capital investments across the state. However, many of these projects have not yet submitted applications to construct the Class VI injection wells necessary for CO2storage. The order could pause the development of these and any new CCS projects in Louisiana indefinitely.

CCS projects in the state have faced increasing scrutiny from parish governments and local community groups, and the order acknowledges the concerns of “citizens and communities” while citing recent state legislation requiring the LDENR to give “substantial consideration” to local governments’ comments on permit applications and other CCS-related actions. The order also points to President Donald Trump’s support of “energy innovation by advancing technologies” such as CCS and several national executive orders regarding energy, which it finds “necessitate constant evaluation of Louisiana’s own energy policies and laws.” Although CCS technology may “provide an opportunity to lift citizens of Louisiana out of poverty,” the order says this must be balanced against the State’s “vital obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and the environment.”

Keep in mind, the order does not provide for an automatic end to the new review moratorium after the LDENR’s 45-day review period for pending applications ends. It remains unclear when consideration of new Class VI permit application may resume. In the meantime, the order and related LDENR memoranda make it clear that even pending permits will not be prioritized for review until they have been determined to be complete and compliant with regulatory procedures.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16379_2152.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 19:04:18.844015

Boulet announced Monday continued progress on Lafayette Consolidated Government’s (LCG) Johnston Street and Louisiana Avenue Revitalization Initiative, following the selection of four engineering firms to lead design and engineering along the corridor.

The multi-phase project represents one of the Boulet administration’s top infrastructure priorities—a comprehensive plan to modernize one of Lafayette’s busiest and most economically important corridors.

Since taking office in early 2024, Mayor-President Boulet has worked to move this long-discussed project from concept to action, building on years of study and public conversation. With engineering teams now on board, the project is entering its next phase—improving drainage and utilities, developing designs, and engaging the community throughout the process, according to Boulet's Office.

“Johnston Street has been a cornerstone of Lafayette’s history, and it’s time to revitalize it as we continue to grow and mature,” said Mayor-President Monique B. Boulet. “As our city evolves, we have an opportunity to breathe new life into this area. This project is about more than updating a roadway—it’s about reinstilling pride in our community and creating a corridor that reflects who we are and where we’re going.”

Reimagining a Vital Corridor

Stretching through the heart of Lafayette, Johnston Street and Louisiana Avenue connect key destinations including Downtown Lafayette, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and Moncus Park. Despite its importance, the corridor has faced persistent challenges with traffic congestion, outdated utilities, limited pedestrian and bicycle access, and in many areas, no modern drainage at all, according to LCG.

The Revitalization Initiative aims to change that—modernizing infrastructure, expanding drainage capacity, improving mobility, and creating a more attractive, functional corridor that supports long-term investment.

Key Features

Comprehensive drainage improvements, introducing modern stormwater infrastructure where none currently exists

Upgraded utilities, including undergrounding telecommunications and replacing aging poles to reduce visual clutter

Safer, more efficient intersections and traffic flow

Improved connectivity with sidewalks, bike lanes, and multi-use paths

Placemaking through native landscaping and design improvements

Building Momentum

This progress follows more than a year of groundwork to position the project for success. In May 2025, the Lafayette City Council approved City Ordinance #CO-037-2025, transferring ownership of U.S. 167 (Johnston Street) from the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) to LCG—a major step that put the corridor’s future under local control.

A public drainage meeting in September helped shape early design priorities for Downtown, Midtown, and Freetown areas where stormwater systems are lacking. And on October 10, LCG’s Professional Services Review Committee recommended four engineering firms to guide the 8.5-mile redesign, beginning with the Evangeline Thruway to Doucet Road segment.

Nearly $28.5 million from local, state, and federal sources is already available to support design and early improvements, with additional funding expected through grants, state approvals, and future allocations in LCG’s Capital Improvement Program Budget.

What’s Next

The selected firms will work collaboratively to advance design and engineering, addressing transportation, drainage, land use, and environmental sustainability. Public input will continue to play a key role throughout the process, ensuring that residents and businesses help shape the corridor’s future.

“This corridor connects our people, our neighborhoods, and our commerce,” Boulet added. “It’s been discussed for years — but now, the work is underway. The improvements we make here will shape how Lafayette moves, grows, and thrives for decades to come.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8730856/2147483647/strip/true/crop/864x454+0+16/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F56%2Ff1331c58459fac719e6a2727152f%2Fjohnston.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 19:04:24.089127

We favor a coherent, forward looking national energy policy. One that limits our dependence on foreign resources for reasons of national security, encourages economical use of affordable energy, and helps build a financially strong energy industry that can compete in world markets. Let’s concentrate on these adjectives: “coherent,” “forward looking”and “financially strong” because they go together. Investors want a consistent and forward looking policy. They do not want to tie up money in assets that are uncompetitive or subject to contract revisions at the whim of the government. So, let’s consider four news items that say a lot about current energy policy.

1. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) launched possibly the biggest coal sale in decades, a lease on a Montana property containing 167 million tons of coal. In October, the BLM rejected the one bid it received, $187,000 from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co., which had a mine adjacent to the property. We didn’t misplace any zeroes. It works out to 1.1 cents per ton. (The previous accepted bid was $1.10 back in 2012.) The BLM rejected the bid, as it did for two other Western coal auctions. Bids didn't reflect “market value.” The government blamed the low bid on “the lingering impact”of the Obama-Biden “war on coal.” (As an aside, the volume of coal used for electric generation grew 0.6% per annum in the George W. Bush years, declined 5.5% per year in the Obama era, declined 9.5% per year in the first Trump administration and 3.5% per year in Biden’s ) The last coal fired plant went into service over a decade ago in Texas, and no new ones have been ordered. The main question nowadays is more like, “When will coal plant owners retire their units?” rather than “When will they build new ones?” Coal simply can no longer compete with other energy sources like natural gas. Did the BLM really expect enthusiastic bidding for the property? Do they really believe in the war on coal? If publicly solicited bids don’t represent market value, what does?

2. The administration halted work on the Revolution offshore wind project in September on “security” grounds. The project, being built by Danish company Oersted, is about 80% complete. (The administration halted another project on the grounds that the paperwork was “deficient”.) Oersted went to court, stayed the order, and will complete Revolution, after which who knows what will happen (maybe swap Greenland for Revolution?). There is more at stake than the project, though, because offshore wind requires service vessels, manufacturing facilities and shipyards which are industrial activities that would further the administration’s desire to revive the U.S. maritime industry. Was there a strategic purpose in closing down a project that will produce much needed energy that overrides the damage done to our reputation as a safe place to invest?

3. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal government agency that is the nation’s largest power company, in September announced it would buy electricity from 6 GW of small modular reactors (SMRs) built by NuScale, with the press release emphasizing that TVA will not take any construction risk. Southern Company said the same thing when they started building Plant Vogtle and Westinghouse went bankrupt as a result. ( Do the parties taking the risk have the resources to bear it?) We should note that the few SMRs built to date have come in wildly over budget, including NuScale’s previous effort. In short, we doubt that the SMRs will produce power at a cost less than conventional or renewable resources, but the deal does provide a test ground for a new type of reactor which might provide needed power if electricity demand rises as expected. And the builders get a form of government support that does not require explicit approval of Congress.

4. The price of oil in October dropped to $62 (Brent) and $58 (WTI). Trump’s energy policy is emphasizing the supply side: open up to leasing, drill baby, drill, but more supply without more demand means lower prices, and prices have dropped to a level that may preclude profitable drilling, in part due to weak demand and in part because our friends in the Middle East have kept up their production in order to protect market share. The administration cannot boost demand for oil or gas any more than it can boost demand for steam coal but could it exercise some muscle to persuade our friends in the Middle East to let up (“Listen MBS you want our fighter planes, then stop selling cheap oil”) but that would raise gasoline prices and push up inflation, so forget that idea.

Peter Drucker, the legendary management consultant, advised firms to direct their resources to their winning lines of business rather than to shoring up the losers. The energy business, we would argue, is in the midst of a wave of creative destruction, as new energy technologies supplant old ones. Trump’s energy policy seems to be a combination of determined opposition to new ideas and ineffective support for the old. We asked a Washington insider to explain what theme dominates the administration’s energy policy. He was puzzled, then said, “Possibly a visceral hatred of renewable energy except for geothermal.” Is that the basis for an investable energy policy?

Germany’s government subsidises electricity transmission grid costs with 6.5 billion euros next year, which could reduce the fees by an average of 16 percent for household consumers. Grid fees are a key component of the electricity price in Germany.

For a three-person household with an annual electricity consumption of 4,000 kilowatt hours (kWh), this would result in an average saving of 82 euros next year, Verivox said. Potential savings depend on the region, with the biggest reductions expected in the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (average grid fee reduction of 23%), and the lowest in the state of Bremen (8%).

“Between 2020 and 2025, electricity grid fees for households in Germany rose by around 47 percent. The current reduction is therefore a positive development for private households,” said Verivox’s energy expert Thorsten Storck.

Meanwhile, gas grid fees are set to rise by an average of around 11 percent from next year, according to Verivox. A household with a gas consumption of 20,000 kWh per year can expect to pay around 61 euros more as a result. However, the abolition of Germany's gas storage levy could offset the average increase in gas costs for households, Verivox added. The gas storage levy, which is meant to help finance the filling of the country's storage facilities and is currently paid by consumers with their gas bills, is set to be abolished from the start of 2026.

The Chevy Equinox EV has become the best selling non-Tesla EV in the United States.
The Equinox EV starts at $33,600, while the gasoline Equinox starts at $28,700.
But there are the matters of production volumes and how much auto dealers will push or even have available the Equinox EV.
Overall, in net, what can we expect from the 6 best selling electric vehicles in the US in coming quarters?","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

So, we’re here. The US tax credit for electric vehicles is gone. Objectively, many electric vehicle models still compete very well with the gas-powered competition. However, the stimulus of a tax credit means fewer people will be told “hey, you should consider an EV — you can get a tax credit from it,” something that people with personal or business accountants were often told. And, of course, EVs do now cost more than they did a month ago. But there are also some positive things.

As I wrote previously, the surge in EV purchases that resulted from the tax credit getting killed raised overall awareness about EVs, increased the number of happy EV owners who will rave about their cars to family and friends, and could lead to a lot more word-of-mouth sales. Or not. Who knows?

Naturally, this is a topic I keep wondering about. What happens in the US electric vehicle market now? What will the next several quarters look like? Of course, a large portion of EV sales — the vast majority — are from just a handful of top selling models. So, to consider the overall question, I figured it made some sense to explore the question with these models. I picked out the 6 models that had more than 20,000 sales in the last quarter.

Tesla Model Y: Unfortunately for the Tesla Model Y, this electric crossover has been fighting a decline in sales for the past couple of years. More and more entrants in its class, the sales effect of Elon Musk’s political activities, and the model simply getting older and older have typically meant year-over-year sales declines from the peaks the Model Y reached when it was the top selling vehicle model in the world. For example, in the US, sales of the Model Y went from 96,729 in Q1 2024 to 64,051 in Q1 2025, and went from 101,301 in Q2 2024 to 86,120 in Q2 2025. The Model Y was recently upgraded with a new look, better tech, and an overall refresh that was supposed to make it seem like a new model again. Though, that was at the beginning of the year, so the boost in sales from the refresh has likely worn off by now.

On the positive side, there’s a new cheaper trim of the model. It is actually more expensive than the (better) base model was before the tax credits were eliminated, but on the surface — looking at the upfront price — it looks like a lower entry point for shoppers. Like I said above, other electric crossovers have come onto the scene in recent years and taken some of the Model Y’s sales, but perhaps these other models will be pushed less as legacy automakers step off the electric pedal (after all, fuel economy standards have also been all but eliminated by the Trump administration), making it easier for Tesla to find more customers again?

All things considered, I’m having a hard time seeing Tesla’s trends reversing. Even as the overall US EV market was up significantly, Tesla sales were down, so I do expect the Model Y could continue drifting downward in the next few quarters. Could it get down to just 50,000 sales a quarter? Even lower? The last time it was down in that territory was in the 3rd quarter of 2021 when about 49,900 units were sold in the USA.

Tesla Model 3: The Model 3 is facing many of the same issues as the Model Y, except it’s even older than the Model 3, its refresh happened last year, and most people who used to buy sedans now buy crossovers. On the other hand, there isn’t a lot of competition in the sedan market in the US. In the past year, the Model 3 has gotten around 50,000–60,000 sales a quarter. Can it sustain that? I’m skeptical. If it can’t, are we talking about a drop down to around 30,000, like its Q1 2024 total, or could it go down to 20,000–25,000 sales a quarter, like in the first half of 2021?

Chevrolet Equinox EV: This is an interesting one. The Chevy Equinox EV has become the best selling non-Tesla EV in the United States. It reached 25,085 sales in Q3 2025, well above its previous record from Q4 2024 of 18,089 sales and Q2 2025’s 17,420 sales. Of course, it was boosted by the expiring tax credits, but it has only been on the market since Q2 2024, it quickly got to a pretty decent volume and awareness of the EV has surely risen a great deal, and it competes quite well with its gas-powered twin!

The Equinox EV starts at $33,600, while the gasoline Equinox starts at $28,700. And the Equinox EV stands out with a larger infotainment screen (17.7 inches versus 11.3 inches) and a sharper, more futuristic or modern frontend. Throw in the convenience and cost savings from home charging as well as the nicer driving experience, and it’s easy to see why even many mainstream buyers would choose the Equinox EV over the sort of boring and stale gas-powered Equinox. You have to move up to the $33,600 RS or Activ trim just to get some design tweaks and a bit more character, which happens to be right where that higher tech Equinox EV starts.

But there are the matters of production volumes and how much auto dealers will push or even have available the Equinox EV. I tend to think, though, that the model has reached high enough sales levels that many in the old-school auto world will be compelled to keep moving units. As with all of these models, there are a lot of factors and it’s anyone’s guess. My thought is that after a moderate dip in sales for two quarters, the Equinox EV could come surging back and actually have a strong 2026. Although … there is another wildcard that just hit me. The Equinox EV is no longer the cheapest EV on the market. Chevrolet itself just revived the Bolt at a much lower price, and the new Nissan LEAF is also a few thousand dollars cheaper. So, someone looking for the lowest priced new EV now has other options that are significantly cheaper. Hmm … the Equinox EV could be in for an interesting ride.

Honda Prologue: The Honda Prologue is definitely an interesting one. It is basically a GM vehicle underneath, but it gets a lot of sales from people who just swear by Honda, trust Honda, and think it’s 100% a Honda. The company has a very loyal customer base, and it seems that there are many people who held off on buying an EV until Honda had one out — and now they are happily driving around in Prologues. You see them routinely, and Honda sold 22,236 of them in the 3rd quarter. That said, this was a huge increase from its usual quarterly numbers — 9,561 in the 1st quarter and 6,756 in the 2nd quarter, or even 18,838 in the 4th quarter of 2024.

My concern/hunch is that Honda will struggle to reach 20,000 sales a quarter again with the Prologue. Also, here’s the kicker: the Prologue starts at $47,400, and there are a handful of electric alternatives in this size that seem like a much better deal. That said, for the Honda loyal, the midsize Prologue competes well against the midsize Passport ($44,750) and midsize Pilot ($40,200), and Honda buyers do typically appreciate fuel efficiency — which the Prologue wins in hands down. So, maybe with 20,000+ more of these out on the road, many more mainstream Honda buyers will notice, get intrigued, and go electric. This may be the hardest model of all from this list to conjecture about.

Hyundai IONIQ 5: The IONIQ 5 absolutely stormed the shores in the 3rd quarter, nearly doubling its sales. It went from 10,481 sales in the 2nd quarter to 21,999 sales in the 3rd quarter, well above its previous record of 14,082 sales in the 4th quarter of 2024 (when people first thought the EV tax credit might be killed). Now, the IONIQ 5 stands out, as Hyundai is currently offering and promoting up to $11,000 in retail bonus cash or $0 APR for up to 72 months. The company took the end of the tax credit to mind and went a huge leap forward in offering this financial incentive. So, one would think the IONIQ 5’s sales will continue booming in the 4th quarter. However, these incentives are supposed to end in November, so who knows how far they will go? And what comes after that?

The IONIQ 5 is so unique looking that you can also see buyers gravitating to it naturally just from seeing it on the road, not necessarily because it’s electric. And when you get in the vehicle, it feels a little bit like an “Apple car.” Will that combined with all the extra units out on the road and also combined with all of the natural benefits of electric cars help to move a lot of medal quarter after quarter? Who knows? I’m leaning toward optimistic on the IONIQ 5. I think/hope Hyundai will follow up the $11,000 retail bonus cash with other incentives or a big price cut, and I think the visual appeal, tech, and happy owner chatter of the IONIQ 5 will keep pulling in buyers, especially in EV-happy California where many buyers are now looking for an alternative to Tesla.

Ford Mustang Mach-E: Last but not least, we have the Ford Mustang Mach-E. Similar to the Hyundai IONIQ 5, the Mustang Mach-E nearly doubled its sales in the 3rd quarter, going from 10,178 the quarter before to 20,177. Also like the IONIQ 5, one of the Mustang Mach-E’s big selling points is its unique, attractive design. As Mustangs always have, the Mustang Mach-E stands out on the road, is extra cool and sporty looking, and is just going to win some base number of sales on its smile. It’s also surprisingly cheap — starting at just $37,995. Okay, not cheap, but well below the average new car price and a good territory for a midsize SUV with flair. I’m hopeful that the Mustang Mach-E can return to 20,000 quarterly sales within a year. If Ford gets a little more aggressive on pricing or comes out with some updates — external and/or internal — perhaps it could even stimulate another sales surge.

Overall, in net, what can we expect from the 6 best selling electric vehicles in the US in coming quarters? It’s hard to guess, but … I’m cautiously optimistic. These are strong contenders in the market even against top gas-powered vehicles. There’s also the possibility that they could get more cost competitive in coming months and quarters as trends in the market evolve.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tesla-Model-3-Highland-new.jpeg,N,,2025-10-20 19:22:38.774034

Congress and the public must demand the restoration of OSEP’s capacity.
The right to a free appropriate public education is not discretionary; it is the law of the land.","The recent layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education have done more than eliminate jobs — they have stripped away the very machinery that enforces one of America’s most important civil rights laws: the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), which Congress established to ensure states comply with IDEA (20 U.S.C. § 1416), is being hollowed out. The loss of staff responsible for monitoring, investigation, and technical assistance means that federal oversight — the safeguard that ensures students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) — is vanishing.

Under IDEA, every child with a disability is entitled to FAPE in the least restrictive environment (34 C.F.R. § 300.101 and § 300.114). Those are not suggestions; they are binding federal mandates. The U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed this in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District (2017), holding that schools must offer programs “reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child’s circumstances.” That standard is enforceable only if OSEP has the personnel and authority to ensure compliance.

These rights were not granted lightly. They were won through decades of advocacy and precedent. In PARC v. Pennsylvania (1971) and Mills v. Board of Education (1972), federal courts held that children with disabilities cannot be excluded from public education — decisions grounded in Brown v. Board of Education’s guarantee that separate or unequal schooling violates equal protection. Congress codified those principles when it enacted what became IDEA, expressly finding that “disability is a natural part of the human experience” and that “improving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity” (20 U.S.C. § 1400 (c)(1)).

By dismantling OSEP, the administration is not simply downsizing a bureaucracy; it is undermining civil rights enforcement. Without active federal monitoring, states and districts may quietly erode their obligations under IDEA. The law will remain on paper but lose its power in practice — and children with disabilities will be left without meaningful recourse.

Congress and the public must demand the restoration of OSEP’s capacity. The right to a free appropriate public education is not discretionary; it is the law of the land. We owe it to every child — and to the Constitution’s promise of equal protection — to ensure it is fully enforced.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials.
“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months.
That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent’s rich rare-earth resources when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

“In about a year from now we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won’t know what to do with them,” said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. “They’ll be worth $2.”

Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship “to the next level.”

Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.

“Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we’re seeing from the Chinese,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump’s meeting with Albanese.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.

A push for more mines

The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years — if not decades — to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce their dominance.

Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.

For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.

“Taking away that arrow of China’s to be able to manipulate pricing is a crucial first step for Australia and the West to be able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our demands,” said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China’s influence.

“China is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. “They are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.”

The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.

“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

But Althaus cautioned that Australia can’t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.

“Keep in mind, China has almost a 40-year head start on us,” Althaus said. “We have at least a couple of decades to catch up to China in terms of being able to meet our own supply chain processes.”

Albanese’s visit comes just before Trump is planning to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

The security partnership

Another topic of discussion was AUKUS, a security pact with Australia, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that was signed during U.S. President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration.

Trump noted Monday that AUKUS was established “a while ago” but that the agreement now is “moving along very rapidly, very well.” Albanese said that “our defense and security partnership with AUKUS is so important for us.”

John Phelan, the Navy secretary, said that the U.S. wants to take the original AUKUS framework and improve it for the three signatory countries while clarifying “some of the ambiguity” in it.

“So it should be a win-win for everybody,” Phelan said.

The center-left Albanese was reelected in May and suggested shortly after his win that his party increased its majority by not modeling itself on Trumpism.

“Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” Albanese told supporters during his victory speech.

It includes $1bn to be invested by the two countries in projects in the US and Australia over the next six months, a framework text says.
Asked if Australia would be getting the submarines, Trump said: ""Oh no, they're getting them"".
China currently controls about 70% of rare earths mining and 90% of the processing of the materials, which are found in everything from defence equipment to computer chips and cars.
Albanese said the agreement was aimed at speeding investment in three types of projects, including US investments in processing facilities in Australia.","The US and Australia have signed a deal intended to boost supplies of rare earths and other critical minerals, as the Trump administration looks for ways to counter China's dominance of the market.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the deal would support a pipeline of $8.5bn (A$13bn; £6.3bn) ""ready-to-go"" projects that would expand his country's mining and processing abilities.

It includes $1bn to be invested by the two countries in projects in the US and Australia over the next six months, a framework text says.

The US and Australia have been working on these issues since Trump's first term, but Albanese said the latest agreement would take the partnership to the ""next level"".

On Monday, US President Donald Trump also commented on Australia's multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the US and UK, known as Aukus, saying it was ""full steam ahead"".

Earlier this year, the deal came under the spotlight after the Trump administration said it would review the details to ensure it fit with its ""America First"" agenda, raising concerns Australia may not be able to buy US submarines to replace its ageing fleet.

Asked if Australia would be getting the submarines, Trump said: ""Oh no, they're getting them"".

China currently controls about 70% of rare earths mining and 90% of the processing of the materials, which are found in everything from defence equipment to computer chips and cars.

US companies rely heavily on the materials, making them vulnerable this year as China has taken steps to restrict access to supplies in response to new US tariffs and other tensions.

Albanese said the agreement was aimed at speeding investment in three types of projects, including US investments in processing facilities in Australia.

The two countries also agreed to work together on issues such as pricing, permitting, and rules for government review of the sales of companies and projects in the sector.

The US separately said it would invest in the construction of a 100 tonnes-per-year advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and was preparing to offer some $2.2bn in financing to advance critical minerals projects via its Export-Import Bank.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f70e/live/b4cedae0-add5-11f0-be67-e5f02edf63b3.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 21:04:30.046850

The govt is preparing to submit a detailed proposal under the Centre's PM E-Drive scheme to establish 1,500 high-capacity EV charging stations across the state, each supporting fast charging in the 60kW to 240kW range — sufficient to power heavy vehicles for long-distance operations. The move marks the next phase in Karnataka's electric mobility expansion as it looks beyond lighter vehicles to include e-buses and e-trucks in its electrification drive. With over 6,000 public charging stations already operational, Karnataka leads the country in EV charging infrastructure. As part of the new plan, the energy department will identify strategic locations — such as bus depots, national and state highways, freight corridors, and logistics hubs — to set up these high-capacity charging facilities. According to officials, the financial burden on the state will be minimal, thanks to the central subsidy component, which ranges from 80% to 100% for various parts of the project. The initiative aligns with the objectives of the PM E-Drive scheme launched in Oct 2024, aimed at accelerating EV adoption, strengthening charging networks, and promoting local manufacturing of EV components. Karnataka's proposal dovetails the scheme's goals, and the state has already sought central support for deploying a fleet of e-buses under the same initiative. N Shivashankara, managing director of Bescom, told TOI a formal proposal would be submitted to the Union ministry of heavy industries shortly. Bescom has been designated as the nodal agency for implementing EV charging infrastructure across the state. ""The scheme provides 100% subsidy for upstream components such as transmission lines, transformers, and conductors, while other equipment will receive up to 70% subsidy,"" he explained. As of Aug 2025, India had around 29,000 EV charging stations, of which Karnataka accounted for 6,097 — the highest in the country. Earlier this year, the state held discussions with the Union minister for heavy industries and steel, HD Kumaraswamy, seeking enhanced central assistance and allocation of 4,500 e-buses for Karnataka's transport corporations under the PM E-Drive scheme. While electric cars typically require chargers of 60-120 kW capacity, heavy-duty vehicles such as buses and trucks need 240kW chargers. Bescom has also partnered with major oil companies such as IOCL, HPCL, and BPCL to install about 400 EV charging points at their petrol stations across the state. Slow to fast chargers In a significant development, Karnataka is also upgrading its existing slow-charging infrastructure to fast-charging systems to accelerate EV adoption. ""Slow chargers typically take 3-4 hours to fully charge a vehicle, whereas fast chargers can do it within 30-45 minutes. To reduce waiting time and improve convenience, we've begun converting slow-charging booths into fast-charging stations,"" Shivashankara said. Of the 209 slow-charging stations in Bescom's jurisdiction, 184 have already been upgraded. The conversion costs around Rs 5 lakh for two-wheeler stations and Rs 8 lakh for car stations, he added.

They called for a larger economic approach to balance clean energy goals with affordable energy prices and job security.
According to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, clean energy sector jobs offer average salaries exceeding £50,000, significantly higher than the U.K. average wage of £37,000.
Unions and industry leaders have welcomed the plan, emphasizing its potential to create a skilled and fairly paid workforce essential for the U.K.’s clean energy future.","The U.K. government has unveiled ambitious plans to expand its clean energy workforce, aiming to create 400,000 additional jobs by 2030. The initiative targets key roles such as plumbers, electricians, and welders, which are among 31 priority occupations identified as highly needed in sectors like renewable energy, wind, solar, and nuclear power.

Employment in these industries is expected to nearly double to 860,000 within five years, according to the BBC.

To support this growth, the government will establish five “technical excellence colleges” designed to train workers with skills specific to the clean energy sector. Initial funding of £2.5 million will be directed toward pilot programs in Cheshire, Lincolnshire, and Pembrokeshire.

Special programs will also focus on helping veterans transition into clean energy roles, including solar panel installation and wind turbine manufacturing, while oil and gas workers may access up to £20 million for tailored training to shift into green energy careers.

Additional schemes are planned for ex-offenders, school leavers, and unemployed individuals to broaden workforce participation. The government highlighted the need for 10,000 extra jobs to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk and noted strong growth at Siemens’ wind turbine factory in Hull, reflecting the sector’s expansion.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband reaffirmed a commitment to reducing energy bills by £300 by 2030, despite recent price cap increases that have pushed typical household energy costs up to £1,755 annually. The government described its strategy as a way to create well-paid, secure jobs across the country without requiring workers to relocate, particularly benefiting industrial communities.

Critics, including the Shadow Energy Secretary, expressed concerns that the net-zero target could lead to expensive electricity and job losses in traditional industries such as the North Sea oil sector.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials.
“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months.
That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent’s rich rare-earth resources when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

“In about a year from now we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won’t know what to do with them,” said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. “They’ll be worth $2.”

Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship “to the next level.”

Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.

“Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we’re seeing from the Chinese,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump’s meeting with Albanese.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.

A push for more mines

The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years — if not decades — to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce their dominance.

Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.

For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.

“Taking away that arrow of China’s to be able to manipulate pricing is a crucial first step for Australia and the West to be able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our demands,” said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China’s influence.

“China is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. “They are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.”

The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.

“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

But Althaus cautioned that Australia can’t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.

“Keep in mind, China has almost a 40-year head start on us,” Althaus said. “We have at least a couple of decades to catch up to China in terms of being able to meet our own supply chain processes.”

Albanese’s visit comes just before Trump is planning to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

The security partnership

Another topic of discussion was AUKUS, a security pact with Australia, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that was signed during U.S. President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration.

Trump noted Monday that AUKUS was established “a while ago” but that the agreement now is “moving along very rapidly, very well.” Albanese said that “our defense and security partnership with AUKUS is so important for us.”

John Phelan, the Navy secretary, said that the U.S. wants to take the original AUKUS framework and improve it for the three signatory countries while clarifying “some of the ambiguity” in it.

“So it should be a win-win for everybody,” Phelan said.

The center-left Albanese was reelected in May and suggested shortly after his win that his party increased its majority by not modeling itself on Trumpism.

“Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” Albanese told supporters during his victory speech.

Of three California bills Sonoma Clean Power had been backing in the recently ended session to speed GeoZone projects, only one became law.
Gavin Newsom signed AB 531, which allows geothermal projects of all sizes to be permitted through the California Energy Commission, rather than the current 50-megawatt threshold.
Last year, that amounted to nearly 1.9 gigawatts, which was 70% utility-scale geothermal power and 4% of total statewide electricity generation.
California Energy Commission last year called for doubling the geothermal output by 2035, reaching at least 3 gigawatts by 2030.","Sonoma County has been awarded state money to study where envisioned next-generation power plants could go in the North Coast’s sprawling Geysers geothermal field with the least impacts and potentially the fastest project timelines.

The $1.36 million commitment, unveiled Sept. 29, was one of three totaling $4.56 million from the California Energy Commission’s Geothermal Grant and Loan Program. The funds are expected to be awarded in January, according to John Mack, who manages Permit Sonoma’s Natural Resources Division.

“We’re going to proactively look at the landscape across Lake, Mendocino and Sonoma counties for the best areas for geothermal with the least cultural and environmental impacts and best siting,” Mack said.

The grant period is three years. The plan includes working with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a cutting-edge three-dimensional model of what’s underground, map what’s above ground via LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data, figure out what sites might be the most compatible with geothermal development, visit the sites to confirm results, conduct community-engagement meetings and work with tribes on monitoring high-potential geothermal sites.

“Hopefully, that will give us a lot of information for projects going forward,” Mack said. That information is set to guide future updates to the county’s zoning and general plan.

The signing of Assembly Bill 1359 last year allows geothermal project applicants to opt for county handling of review, replacing a previous law that required a county to have an approved geothermal general plan element to do so. The California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) is still developing regulations for that new law.

Grant partners are Mendocino County and Sonoma Clean Power, which is working with Mendocino and Sonoma counties on the Geysers-focused geothermal opportunity zone, or GeoZone. Chevron New Energies, Eavor Technologies and Ormat Technologies have floated low-water-use, closed-loop ideas for GeoZone projects, but there haven’t been related applications for exploratory or use permits in recent years, Mack said.

The Geysers field includes Lake County, but it’s not participating in the grant, Mack said. Sonoma Clean Power has been making a pitch to Lake County, Clearlake and Lakeport officials about joining the GeoZone effort along with being supplied by the alternative provider of electricity. Clearlake City Council voted to not join at this time, partly because the majority wanted more time to understand the geothermal effort and opt-out process. Lake County Board of Supervisors and Lakeport City Council are set to vote Oct. 21.

Mack told the Journal in March that this grant would be part of Sonoma County’s more forward-thinking approach to geothermal in recent years, recognizing the need for 24/7 renewable energy to meet climate goals.

Of three California bills Sonoma Clean Power had been backing in the recently ended session to speed GeoZone projects, only one became law. AB 526, which would have created a statewide geothermal strategy, like the one for wind power, died in committee. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 531, which allows geothermal projects of all sizes to be permitted through the California Energy Commission, rather than the current 50-megawatt threshold. However, Newsom vetoed AB 527, writing that would have delayed AB 1359 regulations in progress and added fees for exploration projects.

“Following enactment of AB 1359, the federal government created a categorical exemption for NEPA for geothermal exploration,” Sonoma Clean Power CEO Geof Syphers wrote in an email, referring to the federal environmental protection law. “This made geothermal exploration far easier on federal lands and specifically geothermal prospects in states like Nevada and Utah. AB 527 sought to offer a similar streamlined approach to projects in California to make the state competitive for developers considering where to site projects. With AB 527’s veto, the GeoZone and the rest of California will have to work harder to attract investment.”

California produces the most electricity from geothermal in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Last year, that amounted to nearly 1.9 gigawatts, which was 70% utility-scale geothermal power and 4% of total statewide electricity generation.

California Energy Commission last year called for doubling the geothermal output by 2035, reaching at least 3 gigawatts by 2030. The GeoZone concepts call for adding 600 megawatts to the 725 megawatts currently produced from The Geysers. Calpine, the largest producer at that field, has been bringing online a new 25 megawatt plant, starting with 7 megawatts this summer.

“The extreme weather events that crippled Texas in recent years made it clear this investment was overdue,” said Texas State Representative Ana Hernandez, who serves on the Texas Backup Power Package Advisory Committee.
“We felt that it would be interesting to include water outages for that reason.
To boost energy resilience, Texas lawmakers approved $1.8 billion in 2025 for the Texas Backup Power Package.
“Now there’s funding available to help with these backup power sources, like the Texas Backup Power Package.","A growing body of research warns that climate disasters are disproportionately dangerous for older adults, especially those in long-term care settings who rely on others for essential support. Those risks are often compounded in rural areas, where resources are scarce and emergency support is slower to arrive.

As temperatures plummeted and power went out across Texas during the February 2021 Winter Storm Uri, a record-breaking winter storm that brought unprecedented cold and ice, staff at Gainesville Nursing and Rehabilitation, a nursing home in the rural North Texas town of Gainesville, made a desperate call: evacuate all 36 residents. The nursing home had lost both power and water and the facility’s backup systems had failed.

Fire-rescue crews scrambled to borrow school buses to move everyone to a temporary shelter at a nearby college. “We had two buses, and it probably took us four hours to move those 36 residents,” Gainesville Fire-Rescue Chief Twiner told the Gainesville Daily Register in 2021. “We had to take some of their beds—there were beds at [the shelter], but it wasn’t enough.”

Research indicates that extreme weather disproportionately affects rural areas, which also have limited capacity to respond to weather events and the prolonged utility outages that often follow.

A 2025 report from the Federation of American Scientists found that rural communities faced heightened risks from extreme heat, with residents more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, limited healthcare access, and older or substandard housing. In rural areas, heat waves disrupted work, strained local businesses, and exposed weaknesses in aging energy infrastructure, revealing a pressing need for targeted investments in health systems and resilient energy.

A 2025 study published in Natural Hazards Review further found that rural communities hit by natural disasters faced significantly longer power outage recovery times than urban areas, highlighting how limited infrastructure and resources can leave rural populations disproportionately vulnerable.

Power Outages Can Lead to Death

New research is beginning to explain the toll that Winter Storm Uri had on older populations in rural areas. The chaos in Gainesville was just one of hundreds of stories that unfolded across Texas in February 2021. Now, a 2025 study has confirmed the human toll of the severe weather event on these communities. Long-term nursing home residents whose facilities lost power or water during the storm faced significantly higher death rates than those in facilities that remained operational.

The peer-reviewed study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), found that utility failures were the driving factor behind the rise in mortality.

“We can estimate that [the outages] would contribute to about 11 or 12 excess deaths, had those nursing homes not experienced a utility outage,” said Brian Downer, PhD, associate professor in the School of Public and Population Health(SPPH) at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and one of the article’s authors. “To better contextualize those 11 excess deaths, the state of Texas was able to attribute about 150 deaths among adults aged 60 and older…to Winter Storm Uri.”

A 2022 study in Nature found that rural communities faced greater challenges during Winter Storm Uri. Limited resources and slower emergency support made outages harder to manage. Residents in these areas were also less prepared for prolonged power loss, highlighting vulnerabilities in infrastructure and disaster response.

“It is the rural communities that are being disproportionately affected by the power outages,” Downer said about the Nature study.

New Texas Legislation Helps Essential Services Adapt to Severe Weather

In response to such risks, the Texas Legislature authorized $1.8 billion this year for the Texas Backup Power Package, an initiative aimed at strengthening energy resilience through backup power systems and microgrids in critical facilities, including those in rural areas. The program, funded through the broaderTexas Energy Fund, was designed to ensure that essential services like nursing homes, hospitals, and water systems are better equipped to remain operational during future grid emergencies.

“The extreme weather events that crippled Texas in recent years made it clear this investment was overdue,” said Texas State Representative Ana Hernandez, who serves on the Texas Backup Power Package Advisory Committee. “These backup systems allow vital facilities to keep operating even if the main grid goes down.”

The Texas Backup Power Package was passed in 2023, but didn’t receive funding until the 2025 legislative session. It will provide grants and loans for generators, battery storage, and solar systems.

State Representative Hernandez said the program rules will be drafted later this year and applications are expected online by spring 2026, with installations starting that summer. Final eligibility is still being decided, but critical facilities will be prioritized.

“By providing multi-day, stand-alone backup systems, the program ensures that vital services don’t go dark when the grid fails. Health centers, senior living facilities, emergency responders, and other critical operations will be able to stay open and serve the public,” Hernandez said. “In short, it helps communities hold steady in the face of long outages and strengthens overall resilience.”

Outages Deepened Health Risks for Older Adults

During Winter Storm Uri, Texas experienced historically low temperatures and sweeping power failures as the state’s electric grid struggled to meet surging demand.

According to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 578 of the state’s 1,212 nursing homes, nearly half, reported at least one incident during the storm, including 139 that lost power, 327 that had to boil water, and 121 that suffered burst pipes, water shortages, or complete water loss.

An estimated 39,000 residents, about half of all nursing home residents in the state, lived in facilities that reported such incidents, according to data compiled by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

For residents, those outages were more than an inconvenience. They intensified existing health risks and exposed the particular dangers that extreme temperatures pose to older adults.

Andrea Earl, associate state director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Texas, said older adults in care facilities faced heightened risks during extreme temperatures because their bodies struggle to regulate heat and cold. Many residents also have mobility issues, chronic health conditions, or cognitive impairments that limit self-care. Medication, medical equipment needs, and social isolation further increased vulnerability to extreme temperatures, according to Earl. But some nursing facilities lacked staff expertise to recognize early signs of heat or cold stress, making reliable utilities critical for protecting residents’ health.

Some of the effects of extreme weather and utility outages are not immediately detectable.

“In extreme cold, your blood starts to thicken, especially if you’re older, and that increases the risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular incidents. And I think the hard part about both is these things don’t come on right away,” Earl said.

In the JAMA study, researchers captured these longer term effects by reviewing outcomes over the course of the weeks following the storm.

“We really need to start paying attention to these more delayed effects that are coming up,” said Alex Holland, a doctoral student in population health sciences at UTMB and a co-author of the JAMA article. “In our study, we didn’t really see that difference in mortality until three weeks after winter storm Uri, so there’s somewhat of a delayed effect.”

New Backup Systems Target Future Outages

The Texas Backup Power Package aims to strengthen the state’s energy infrastructure by installing generators, microgrids, and batteries at critical facilities across the state that could run independently when there are grid failures.

Winter Storm Uri caused economic losses upwards of $80 billion. The state’s power grid faced an unprecedented surge in electricity demand and critical parts of the system failed.

To prevent a total collapse that could have taken weeks or even months to recover from, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages most of Texas’s electric grid, implemented emergency blackouts.

Some of the water shortages were directly tied to ERCOT emergency directives, which required utilities to reduce power consumption to stabilize the electric grid.

In Medina County, a rural area west of San Antonio, water was unavailable during Winter Storm Uri, even for essential needs like drinking, bathing, and flushing toilets. Nursing homes in the county were among those affected, facing dangerous conditions as power and water systems failed.

As part of their research, Downer and Holland spoke with nurse practitioners at UTMB who conduct home visits to nursing homes in the area. They said the access to water can be critical to mitigate health risks and manage hygiene.

“[The nurse practitioners] were really emphasizing how both physical and oral hygiene can be really important, not only to just general quality of life and a person’s comfort, but also, too, from an infection risk, especially when it comes to oral health,” Downer said. “We felt that it would be interesting to include water outages for that reason. And then also, too, since power and water outages tend to occur together.”

Those health risks are amplified in rural areas, where limited infrastructure and slower emergency response make outages harder to manage.

Although this utility collapse was widely attributed to frozen power plants, a University of Texas study highlighted the need for better energy efficiency measures to reduce strain on the grid and protect vulnerable populations during extreme weather events.

“There’s a whole host of reasons why extreme weather events can result in lower supply,” said Joshua Rhodes, PhD, a research scientist at the University of Texas and one of the report’s authors. “[During Winter Storm Uri,] we saw [that] every single kind of power plant didn’t perform as well as we would have liked it to perform. We saw power plants freeze, be they coal, natural gas or nuclear, wind. We saw snow on top of solar panels. But we also saw the natural gas sector freeze…we lost the ability to produce about 80% of the natural gas in the Permian Basin, and so we weren’t able to move as much natural gas. We also had a bunch of power plants that just couldn’t get fuel.”

Winter Storm Uri brought the state’s energy sector to a standstill and future extreme weather threatens to do the same.

“Texas is seeing more disasters as more people live in areas where we have hurricanes, and as, just generally, more people are around, and we rely on more things for electricity,” Rhodes said.

To boost energy resilience, Texas lawmakers approved $1.8 billion in 2025 for the Texas Backup Power Package.

“We’re recognizing that there are thousands of facilities across the state, many in rural areas, but some also in urban areas, that provide vital community services, like water treatment facilities, fresh water facilities, assisted living centers and other medical facilities…,” said Texas Senator Nathan Johnson, who led legislation to create and fund the Texas Backup Power Package. “So in order to make that more affordable, what we wanted to do is just put some state money behind it.”

“Modern life runs on electricity,” Rhodes said. “I think it’s good that we’re at least keeping the critical parts of that life, of that livelihood, up and running whenever we run into issues.”

An Uncertain Pathway Forward

Researchers and advocates said that while the Texas Backup Power Package has potential to serve long-term care residents, it is not a guaranteed fix.

During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers failed to pass SB 481, which would have required nursing and assisted living facilities in Texas to maintain safe temperatures during emergencies with backup power systems. Without such state regulations, Earl expressed concern that many facilities may be unaware of the Texas Backup Power Package program or lack the capacity to apply for it.

“A lot of these places are understaffed…so any extra administrative processes might be a hindrance to why they would apply,” Earl said. “We’re hopeful that facilities out there are paying attention to [the backup power package], but I think that’s another thing too. How well is this fund going to be marketed? Are we going to see these facilities know firsthand that they can apply for this? How are they going to find out about it?”

Holland said that the successful implementation of backup power also depends on training and education for effective emergency preparedness.

“Now there’s funding available to help with these backup power sources, like the Texas Backup Power Package. But then the question becomes like, well, then what? These facilities might not know, what is the best power supply backup for us? Where should we put them?” Holland said. “We see sometimes that generators end up getting put on the floor and ground level in areas that are prone to flooding or nursing home staff aren’t trained on how to use this emergency backup equipment.”

Without proper guidance and preparation, the funding alone cannot guarantee that facilities will be ready when disaster strikes.

“Disaster preparedness is for everybody,” Holland said. “I think especially that’s something that lends itself very strongly to rural communities [where] you kind of have that ‘everybody knows everybody’ feel. And so taking that into the disaster preparedness side of things, and knowing how your city or your county is preparing for some of these events, or, what are the resources in place, kind of at that local level, also definitely come into mind.”

Earl emphasized that emergency preparedness shouldn’t wait for tragedy.

“We don’t think death should be the underlying reason for, or the catalyst for, doing backup power and requiring a certain level of power in these facilities,” Earl said. “We think that there’s a lot of dignity with this stage of life and where you’re at and that that should be preserved, especially if you are paying to be in a facility and putting your hard earned dollars and assuming and expecting a certain level of care.”

Nobody has built a new crush plant in the Southeast for 15 years and for North Carolina, 50 years.","For Rowan County, N.C. farmer Philip Sloop, the most frustrating part of the ongoing trade war between the United States and China and the growing competition from Brazil is the fact that U.S. farmers are known to produce better quality soybeans than Brazilian farmers.

“We are held to a lot higher standard than Brazil,” said Sloop, the president of North Carolina Soybean Producers Association. Sloop produces corn and soybeans near Mount Ulla, 40 miles north of Charlotte.

What’s even more frustrating for Sloop and other U.S. soybean farmers is that Brazil is rapidly expanding its land devoted to soybean production, while U.S. soybean acreage is declining. The fact that Brazil is cutting down the Amazon Rainforest to boost its crop and livestock production bothers Sloop.

“That is clearly something we would never do in the United States. Our farmland is decreasing, not increasing. This is clearly an unfair trade practice by Brazil,” Sloop said.

Investigating Brazil

On July 15, the U.S. Trade Representative initiated an investigation against Brazil that includes illegal deforestation. The trade representative’s complaint cites Brazil’s lack enforcement of its environmental laws and regulations that have contributed to illegal deforestation for crop and livestock production.

The topic was front and center at the NC Chamber’s Ag Allies Conference Sept. 30 at the NC State University McKimmon Center in Raleigh, where Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden said unfair competition from Brazil presents a long-term threat to U.S. soybean farmers.

“Obviously, that is not a production practice that we have here in the United States. We are producing more with less land because we are losing farmland every year, and we are asked to compete against a country that is literally destroying one of our world’s great ecological treasures to up its agricultural footprint. That’s unfair. That is quite frankly immoral,” Vaden told the conference of North Carolina agribusiness leaders.

Solutions needed

In a press conference following his remarks, Vaden noted that even if China begins immediately purchasing U.S. soybeans, it won’t remove Brazil’s production from the world market. He said solutions across the board are needed to address the dire economic situation of low commodity prices and high production costs.

Vaden said both greater trade access for U.S. corn and soybeans and increased domestic use through biofuels are needed in addition to dealing with unfair competitors like Brazil. “We in the United States are obviously not going to be burning down forestland in order to expand our agricultural footprint.”

According to the U.S. Trade Representative complaint, agricultural production, particularly for soy plantations and cattle ranches, has been one of the main drivers of deforestation in Brazil. The complaint said deforestation reached a 15-year high in 2021.

The complaint notes that deforestation has declined in recent years, but deforestation rates were estimated at 3,403 hectares (8.409 acres) per day in 2024. The complaint said evidence indicates that 91% of the deforestation could be illegal.

For Sloop, the trade war is frustrating. Building markets and moving supply is the only way to push up commodity prices. He acknowledged the basis and the pork and poultry sectors in North Carolina were the only reason corn and soybeans can be competitively grown across the Carolinas. “We can’t get the yields they get in the Midwest.”

North Carolina is still a grain-deficit state. Charles Hall, CEO of the North Carolina Soybean Producers Association, estimates that about half of the soybeans used by North Carolina’s livestock sector are provided by local farmers, with the rest coming from the Midwest.

“We are not directly dependent very much on the China channel. Our biggest customers are right here in our backyard. This creates local demand, and the supply chain is very short,” Hall said.

Cautious optimism

Sloop said he is “praying for the best and planning for the worst” in the current environment of low commodity prices and high production costs. Targeted management is the only way to succeed.

“We’re only spending money on what’s necessary. We’ve been fortunate that we’ve had decent rain for the most part. We have an average crop of corn and soybeans. We used less expensive weed control this year and cut back on our seed costs. We’re already using variable rate technology on everything,” he said.

Sloop said the goal is to aim for profit, not big yields.

“Pushing yields doesn’t help anybody if we can’t use the beans. We have to diversify when it comes to exporting our soybeans. If the beans aren’t going to be used domestically, they have to be diversified where they go. We can’t put all of our eggs in that China basket anymore. Any time a trade war pops up, it seems soybeans are the first thing to suffer,” Sloop said.

Hall said the first U.S. trade war with China in 2018 incentivized Brazil to ramp up its soybean production to meet Chinese demand.

“When we got into that trade dispute with China, it incentivized Brazil to put more virgin land into soybean production. Brazil produces 40% of the world’s soybeans. The unintended consequence of our trade dispute with China and the dispute right now is that it encourages Brazil to do even more of that expansion. We can’t make new farmland in the United States. We are losing farmland in the United States,” he said.

Hall said an added challenge for North Carolina soybean farmers is the lack of crush plants to create soybean meal for livestock. “There are not many crush plants in the East. Nobody has built a new crush plant in the Southeast for 15 years and for North Carolina, 50 years. No one is going to build a new crush plant here. The Midwest has plenty of crush capacity.”

This spring, Archer-Daniels Midland shuttered its Kershaw, S.C. soybean processing plant citing cost cutting and consolidation. In 2014, Cargill closed its soybean crush plant in Raleigh citing decreased demand and variable and seasonally driven processing needs. Currently, the only two crush plants are the Cargill facility in Fayetteville and the East Carolina Oilseed Processing Plant in Pantego.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt157c4e6072fa225b/68f29ac30d67655311835eb5/IMG_1380_web.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-20 17:19:09.345457

The merger, expected to complete by the end of 2025, coincides with World Geothermal Energy Day and marks a major step toward unlocking the UK’s untapped geothermal potential.

The REA and GEAA have signed Heads of Terms for the acquisition, under which GEAA’s membership and expertise will be integrated into the REA. The move reflects growing confidence in geothermal as a clean, reliable source of heat and power.

Trevor Hutchings, Chief Executive of the REA, said: “This move establishes a powerful new platform to help unlock the UK’s exciting geothermal potential. Whether that’s for clean sources of heat for homes and businesses, or new low carbon power generation – geothermal has an important and currently under-valued role to play.

“I am determined that by the REA and GEAA coming together in this way we can ensure that geothermal energy plays a key role in the UK’s journey to greater energy security, energy sovereignty, local jobs and lower emissions.”

Karl Farrow, Founder and Chief Executive of CeraPhi Energy and Chair of GEAA, reflected on the organisation’s journey: “We started GEAA over a kitchen table in the midst of Covid nearly 5 years ago. We now need a bigger table and evolving GEAA into the geothermal arm of the REA as the Geothermal Energy Forum is a natural next step for GEAA and its members.”

Industry leaders welcomed the move as a sign of sectoral maturity.

Ross Glover, CEO of Star Energy, said: “This sort of coalition building is critical for the UK geothermal sector. We are excited to play our role in the Geothermal Energy Forum and actively participate in shaping key policy engagements with the Government.”

Karen Spenley, UK Country Manager of Celsius Energy, added that the merger will give geothermal “a unified voice to grow and thrive.”

Jon Gluyas, Board Member at the National Geothermal Centre, said the merger “will strengthen and deepen the already great relationship between the NGC and the REA” and help advocate for policies to improve “energy security, energy sustainability and energy equity.”",https://www.energylivenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shutterstock_2654636167.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 22:18:51.259384

One telltale sign that you are reading or listening to something that is not giving you the full story will be the language used.
If the language is expansive and nuanced, there's a better chance that what you are reading or listening to will have some value.","In George Orwell's novel, 1984, a totalitarian regime now rules the homeland and operates by three slogans: 1) War is peace, 2) freedom is slavery and 3) ignorance is strength. In 1984, the term ""Newspeak"" refers to what is essentially a mandatory style guide for using the English language under that regime by substituting Newspeak formulations for common words and phrases so as to make public discourse conform to the ruling party's orthodoxy. (For a list of Newspeak words and phrases, check here.)

Not surprisingly, failure to conform to this style in written and oral communications is considered a crime. In fact, to think thoughts contrary to those expressed in Newspeak terms is considered a ""thoughtcrime"" because it implies one's personal values are not in harmony with official party dogma. Even having a facial expression that appears to imply disagreement with that dogma is a ""facecrime.""

Every modern regime tries to regulate the language used by its citizens (or subjects, as the case may be). As I have written previously, ""If you want to corrupt a people, corrupt the language."" So, it's not particularly surprising that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), now controlled by an oil industry insider, has put out its own Newspeak-like manual in the form of an email to department employees, which is focused on subtracting words and phrases according to Politico. In the email, the DOE is doing to the vocabulary of its personnel what the Trump administration is doing to the government, namely, cutting it.

The latest announcement appears to apply to those working for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and adds to a list that was started some time ago. The list of ""words to avoid"" now includes the following:

clean or dirty energy

carbon/CO2 footprint

climate change

decarbonization

emissions

energy transition

green

sustainability/sustainable

tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies

Of course, this off-limits list seems ludicrous since all of these topics have been widely discussed in publications that fill library shelves and online repositories of scholarly work, journalism, and policy papers. How could this directive actually enforce the kind of rigorous elimination of ideas and words, á la 1984, which are ""misaligned with the Administration’s perspectives and priorities"" as the email puts it? Of course, it cannot.

However, DOE employees will henceforth not be allowed to use such words, and that will have definite effects on policy discussions for the simple reason that none of the ideas associated with those words will be contemplated in those discussions.

As social psychologist Eric Fromm explains in an afterword to the edition of 1984 that I have, the goal is not simply to force people to say the opposite of what they think. Fromm writes: ""[I]n a successful manipulation of the mind the person is no longer saying the opposite of what he thinks, but he thinks the opposite of what it true.""

There is a lot of that going around these days thanks to social media. People often only have discourse with those with whom they agree and agree to facts which they cannot personally verify and which may be the opposite of what they are told. If this were merely a benign process—say, revolving around the best way to make a Bundt cake—we'd have little to worry about. But it involves the very essence of how we will govern ourselves and how we will face a future of increasingly dangerous climate change and resource depletion.

In 1984 the main character, Winston, works for the Ministry of Truth where he helps to rewrite history to conform to the ideological views of the single political party that controls his country. Since the party changes its ideas and policies not infrequently, there are many people like Winston at the ministry rewriting history on a daily basis.

I am reminded of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. In 1953 following the arrest and execution of Lavrentiy Beria, former head of the interior ministry and secret police, the publishers sent out three pages to owners of the encyclopedia on the topics of the Bering Sea and Bishop Berkeley (an Irish philosopher and clergyman), and asked owners to cut out the three pages which covered the life of Beria and replace them with these new pages.

As the DOE tries to turn the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy into a mini ministry of truth, we should remember that forces representing the full spectrum of ideological beliefs are constantly putting out versions of history and versions of the present to advance their goals. Some may be accurate, some may merely be selective—no one can write a history of everything or cover the entire span of current events—and some may be flat-out lies.

One telltale sign that you are reading or listening to something that is not giving you the full story will be the language used. If the vocabulary is limited, repetitive, and/or sounds like sloganeering, you would do well to be skeptical of the writer or speaker. If the language is expansive and nuanced, there's a better chance that what you are reading or listening to will have some value.

Miliband hinted the 5% VAT charge on bills could be removed in next month’s budget, which would cost the government £2.5bn.
Many of us have been pointing out for ages that clean energy is not a free lunch (certainly not by 2030), but the experts’ numbers were revealing in their precision.
Equally, though, Miliband’s claim that the “sprint” to clean energy by 2030 will – of itself – cut £300 from household bills now seems fanciful.
Last week’s warning from suppliers on bills ought to mark a turning point: the clean energy plan needs an injection of cold-headed pragmatism.","“I know my job is to get bills down by £300,” said Ed Miliband, the energy security secretary, in his BBC interview at the weekend, acknowledging that the government is on the hook for its pre-election promise to reduce energy bills by 2030.

The problem, though, is that the bill-cutting task also seems to be falling by default to Rachel Reeves, the chancellor. It is beginning to look as if the only sure way to make energy bills fall by £300 by 2030 is to shuffle a chunk of the expense into general taxation. Miliband hinted the 5% VAT charge on bills could be removed in next month’s budget, which would cost the government £2.5bn.

To put it mildly, Reeves is unlikely to be delighted by this prospect but she, like everyone else, will have heard the high-powered crew of retail energy bosses set out the arithmetic on bills in stark terms to a Commons select committee last week.

Many of us have been pointing out for ages that clean energy is not a free lunch (certainly not by 2030), but the experts’ numbers were revealing in their precision. “If we continue on the path we are on, in all likelihood electricity prices are going to be 20% higher even if wholesale prices halve,” said Rachel Fletcher of Octopus Energy. “Non-commodity costs are adding about £300 [a year] of pressure,” she added, referring to everything from the costs of maintaining and upgrading the gas and electricity transmission networks to funding the rollout of renewable and nuclear generating capacity. Chris Norbury, the chief executive of E.On UK, and Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF UK’s energy business, said much the same.

Far from being “speculation” – as Miliband’s department dismissed it – the bosses’ analysis flows from granular details. One can see, for example, the subsidies for wind and solar capacity under construction or likely to be commissioned; the multiyear charge for the Sizewell C nuclear power station; and the rates of return that the regulator Ofgem will allow the three big electricity transmission companies to earn as they build the £80bn new grid.

Note that the criticisms are not coming from opponents of the ambition of switching to cleaner energy, or from net zero sceptics. All that is really being asked is an examination of tradeoffs, sequencing, who should pay and what options exist for doing things more cheaply. “There is no budgetary control of this,” Fletcher said. Rossi noted that electricity demand is 9% lower today than in 2019. Norbury said policymakers should look at the extent to which “incentives being offered to build infrastructure are necessary”.

Miliband can argue, as he did in a speech last week, that his job is harder because of “the legacy of decades of underinvestment in energy in this country”. Absolutely true. The grid is old, as are most of the nuclear and gas-fired plants. Even if the UK were not decarbonising and electrifying, there would be a large catchup bill. New gas stations, the Tories’ preferred short-term option, aren’t free either.

Equally, though, Miliband’s claim that the “sprint” to clean energy by 2030 will – of itself – cut £300 from household bills now seems fanciful. Sir Dieter Helm, a leading energy economist, put it bluntly in a recent Bloomberg podcast: “We have hit the reality wall. It isn’t going to be £300 cheaper – unless the gas price falls very sharply … The problem for the government, I think, is that half the government understands that and half the government doesn’t.”

What should be done? Step one would be to recognise that the 2030 deadline for clean power, defined as 95% low-carbon generation, was always arbitrary and that trying to hit it almost certainly adds expense because speed is being prioritised over cost. Would the UK’s long-term decarbonisation and electrification strategy really be imperilled if, say, only 80% was achieved by 2032? Hardly.

Once that mental hurdle is cleared, options open up. One of the energy suppliers’ complaints, in essence, is that grid capacity is being commissioned to arrive before it is needed (and customers will have to pay for it) and that smarter energy-using solutions may be more effective. They may have a point. So concentrate above all else on minimising “constraint” costs, the maddening payments to windfarms (usually in Scotland) to turn off when it’s too windy, plus incentives to other generators (usually gas-fired plants in the south of England) to fire up on the other side of a bottleneck. Such payments are still projected to hit £4bn by the end of decade, and threaten to become an electoral liability in 2029.

Or slow the rollout of renewables, especially offshore wind, where the big cost variable is developers’ borrowing costs. If there is a reasonable expectation that interest rates will be lower in future (not impossible), why not wait for cheaper “strike” prices in future auction rounds? As things stand today, the government has said it will pay up to £113 a megawatt hour for offshore wind capacity in this year’s auction, AR7, far above the gas-dictated wholesale price of £83 MWh over the past 12 months.

“We won’t buy at any price and if specific technologies aren’t competitive, we will look elsewhere,” Miliband also said last week about AR7. If he means it, he could show seriousness by ordering, say, only 4 gigawatts of offshore wind this year, rather than 8-plus the industry is expecting.

In Reeves’s shoes, you’d be insisting on such cost-cutting thinking.

Natural gas from the Permian basin in West Texas primarily serves northwestern, central, and southwestern Mexico through various natural gas systems in Mexico, EIA said.

Exports from West Texas increased to 1.8 bcfd in 2024 from 0.6 bcfd in 2019, facilitated by the commissioning of additional connecting pipelines in central and southwestern Mexico in recent years.

The country is continuing plans to expand its domestic pipeline network to meet potential demand growth. Natural gas imported from the South Texas corridor through the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline has access to LNG terminals, power plants, and other uses of demand, and the pipeline connects with the Gasoducto Puerta al Sureste (Southeast Gateway Gas pipeline), an offshore pipeline completed in 2025 and designed to supply natural gas to new power plants in the Yucatan Peninsula.

In 2022, sections of the Tula–Villa de Reyes and Tuxpan–Tula pipelines began partial operation, with full service anticipated this year. The Energia Mayakan pipeline is expected to expand natural gas infrastructure on the Yucatán Peninsula by 2025. Developers of the Centauro del Norte pipeline, which will provide additional pipeline capacity to northwestern Mexico's combined-cycle power plants, began construction in 2025.

LNG was first exported from Mexico in August 2024 from the Fast LNG Altamira Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) 1. Two additional LNG export projects, Fast LNG Altamira FLNG 2 and Energía Costa Azul, are currently under construction with a combined capacity of 0.6 bcfd, drawing supply from US natural gas imports, EIA noted. Supporting pipelines, such as the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan and Gasoducto Rosarito expansion enable the LNG export projects.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/10/68f69175276eb522b376a275-251020eianatgasmexicoexports.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-20 16:19:36.968606

This gas plant, which will be located across the street from Woodland Elementary School in Person County, will expose Duke customers to significant rate increases and expensive fossil gas costs for decades and drive significant pollution, including greenhouse emissions. That the approval of this plant was issued the day after the Commission concluded a two-day Large Load Technical Conference in which several experts provided data demonstrating that Duke’s projected load forecast likely overestimates the amount of large customer load that will come online in the coming years is especially disappointing.

During the hearing on July 22, SACE witness Lucy Metz of Synapse presented testimony that highlighted significant concerns with this proposed gas plant. Witness Metz testified that “DEP has not demonstrated that the Proposed Facility is lower cost than a portfolio of dispatchable capacity (e.g. battery storage or even combustion turbines) paired with solar and wind.” She recommended that the Commission deny Duke’s request or, at a minimum, require Duke to issue an all-source request for proposals prior to ruling on the request to determine if there are indeed resources available to provide both the capacity and the energy needed to serve future load growth. Even the Public Staff testified that the second CC may not be the least cost solution.

In the order approving the plant, the Commission notes that modeling in Duke’s 2023 CPIRP establishes a “need” for the second CC. But this modeling from almost two years ago does not reflect the current rising costs associated with power plant construction and firm gas transportation contracts. The estimated cost of this plant at the time of filing is confidential, but Duke Energy has proposed building a similar gas plant in Indiana that is only 100 MW larger at a cost of $3.33 billion. What if the cost of Duke’s second Roxboro gas plant balloons to this amount? Would it still have been selected by the modeling in the 2023 CPIRP proceeding as the least-cost resource to meet the forecasted need? I think that’s highly unlikely.

And what about the associated pipeline costs that will be incurred to supply both Roxboro CCs at the Person County site 47 miles away from the nearest interstate gas transmission pipeline? This plant (along with the first CC approved last December) will require not-yet built pipeline capacity from an expansion project on the Williams Transco pipeline and/or a not-yet built Mountain Valley Pipeline expansion as well as redelivery along the not-yet built 55-mile Enbridge T15 pipeline. Duke has contracted for firm pipeline capacity on all three of these projects, but as with the cost of the plants, these pipeline contracts are confidential too. SACE has done a deep dive on escalating pipeline costs in the Southeast, and we have determined that these costs are becoming so significant that their net present value should be evaluated as part of the total cost of the plant. The North Carolina Public Staff and the Commission Staff can both get access to these confidential pipeline contracts as a part of the Commission’s review of Duke’s proposed gas plant, and they can calculate the net present value themselves to understand just how significant they are (potentially a quarter of the cost of the plant itself or higher). And unlike the cost of the plant, which will face additional scrutiny in an upcoming rate case, the cost of firm pipeline transportation is passed straight through to ratepayers. Duke has no skin in the game and no incentive to negotiate in the ratepayers’ interest on what is essentially a fixed asset (pipeline capacity) that could run the lifetime of the plant itself.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-20 17:04:45.511531

The “Rocky Mountain Gas Roadmap & Implementation Playbook,” developed under the Western States and Tribal Nations Energy (WSTN) Initiative, identifies key infrastructure pathways to connect responsibly produced natural gas from the Rockies to growing domestic and international markets. The roadmap was released during the New Mexico and Wyoming Advanced Energy Roundtable, where Governor Lujan Grisham, Governor Gordon, and Japanese Ambassador Shigeo Yamada discussed energy and technology partnerships.

The roadmap outlines two main routes—the Pacific Northwest Pathway and the Southwest Pathway—that leverage existing infrastructure and rights-of-way to efficiently move Rocky Mountain natural gas to expanding U.S. markets, while also offering the quickest and most affordable connections to Asian markets without relying on the Panama Canal.

“New Mexico is ready to lead the way in unlocking the Rocky Mountain’s potential to create jobs and opportunity, strengthen international collaboration, and write the next chapter in global energy,” said Governor Lujan Grisham. “Putting the Rockies’ abundant energy to work benefits red and blue states by fueling our economies and the transition to clean energy.”

“Both Wyoming and New Mexico have led the country in producing certified gas meeting UN standards, and Japan is particularly interested in that opportunity for cooperation and investment,” said Governor Mark Gordon. “We can provide natural gas resources very near-term—almost immediately—and this is just good business. It’s about moving into a future that meets climate concerns while making sure energy is there as demand continues to grow enormously.”

“This is a very informative and detailed introduction to the potential of Rocky Mountain natural gas, and it is very much appreciated by the Japanese,” said Japanese Ambassador Shigeo Yamada. “I hope today’s meeting will lead to further cooperation and economic partnership between Japan and the State of New Mexico.”

“This playbook is the culmination of years of work and is designed as a tool to help policymakers and commercial actors seize the major opportunities that Rockies gas present to domestic markets seeking lower-carbon gas and the Asian nations that will drive global demand in the coming decades,” said WSTN Chairman Jason Sandel. “We have the gas and the cleanest molecules of it. This playbook shows the way to the markets that need it.”

The roadmap builds on Lujan Grisham’s April trade mission to Asia, where she met with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to strengthen cooperation between Japan and the American West on energy and technology partnerships.

Rocky Mountain gas offers competitive advantages: cost-effective production with breakeven costs between $3.10 and $3.90 per MMBtu, low-carbon certified gas from producers who have achieved significant methane emissions reductions, and 277 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable reserves capable of serving both regional and international demand.

The two pathways: the Pacific Northwest Pathway serves power markets in Utah, Idaho, and the Pacific Northwest, and the Southwest Pathway expands supplies to the Desert Southwest and Mexico. The Southwest route reduces shipping times to Asia by approximately 50 percent compared to Gulf Coast routes through the Panama Canal. Both pathways target growing demand from data centers, manufacturing, and electrification.

The Wyoming Energy Authority, the New Mexico Economic Development Department, the New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department, the Utah Governor’s Office of Energy Development, the Southern Ute Growth Fund, the Jicarilla Apache Nation, and the western Colorado counties of Garfield, Mesa, Moffat and Rio Blanco funded the roadmap, which was developed by Guidehouse under the direction of WSTN and representatives of the participating governments.",https://www.governor.state.nm.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/News-from-the-office-of-the-governor-michelle-lujan-grisham.webp,N,,2025-10-20 19:22:44.861919

Euralarm has published the recording of its recent webinar on fire safety for electric vehicles (EVs) in indoor parking and charging facilities.

The session aimed to clarify common misconceptions about EV fire risks and present practical approaches to fire protection in mixed-vehicle parking environments.

The European association said the webinar, hosted by its Extinguishing Section, provided factual comparisons between electric and combustion vehicle fire behaviour.

Speakers discussed the fire load of modern vehicles, thermal runaway in battery cells, and specific risks associated with charging infrastructure.

The event featured contributions from Kurt Hilen, Vice Chair of Euralarm’s Extinguishing Section, who helped develop the association’s guidance paper on EV fire safety in parking and charging facilities.

Myths and facts on EV fire risk

According to Euralarm, public perception often overstates the likelihood of EV fires compared with traditional vehicles.

The association presented data showing hybrid vehicles experience the highest fire frequency, while battery electric vehicles have a lower fire incident rate than combustion-engine vehicles.

Euralarm explained that total vehicle fire load depends largely on plastics and tyres rather than power source, with both electric and conventional vehicles presenting comparable fire loads.

Hilen said: “Battery electric vehicles do not catch fire more often than vehicles with internal combustion engines.”

He added that EV fires are extinguishable but require adapted methods due to battery design and positioning.

Fire safety challenges in parking environments

Euralarm highlighted that increasing vehicle size, plastic content and limited access in multi-storey or underground car parks complicate firefighting operations.

The association noted that confined ventilation and closely parked vehicles can accelerate fire spread and obstruct evacuation.

It described phenomena such as thermal runaway, toxic gas release and stranded energy as unique challenges that demand longer firefighting efforts and higher water volumes.

During charging, faulty installations, damaged cables or inadequate maintenance can act as ignition sources.

Euralarm said charging zones should therefore be prioritised for proactive fire protection and regular inspection.

Recommended protection measures and design priorities

The webinar outlined that the primary objectives in parking facility fire safety remain life protection, safe evacuation and structural stability.

A holistic strategy combining preventive, technical and organisational measures was presented.

These include correct installation and maintenance of charging systems, automatic fire detection, water-based suppression, emergency shut-offs and smoke extraction systems.

Hilen explained that automatic detection and suppression systems, when integrated, can prevent spread between vehicles and support firefighter access.

He said: “Each of these elements plays an important role, but only their integration provides truly effective fire protection.”

Focus areas for future implementation

Euralarm concluded that fire protection requirements for parking areas are evolving as vehicle technology advances.

The organisation advised that automatic fire detection should be considered a basic standard in every parking garage.

Resources, it said, should be prioritised for charging areas where vehicle density and electrical risk are greatest.

The full webinar recording and Euralarm’s guidance paper on fire safety for electric vehicles in parking and charging facilities are now available online.

Relevance for fire and safety professionals

This development is relevant for fire engineers, building designers, facility managers, fire protection contractors and regulatory authorities.

The findings address design and operational issues specific to mixed-vehicle parking environments, particularly in enclosed or multi-storey structures.

The guidance supports updated risk assessments, system integration and compliance planning for facilities incorporating EV charging infrastructure.

It also reinforces the need for regular maintenance and inspection of charging installations to prevent electrical faults.

For system specifiers and installers, the emphasis on early detection, water-based suppression and integrated safety controls provides actionable reference points for upgrading protection systems.

Prices have crept up compared to last month, but several automakers have covered the $7,500 credit themselves or added extra incentives, and the price of one EV even dropped. Here are October’s top EV lease deals, spotted by our friends at CarsDirect.

2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 lease from $189/month

The updated 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5 SE RWD Standard Range remains one of the standout EV lease deals this month, holding steady even after the end of the federal EV tax credit and new import tariffs. Through November 3, you can lease one for $189 a month for 36 months (10,000 miles per year) with $3,999 due at signing. That works out to an effective monthly cost of about $300 – just $40 more than September.

The price bump is far smaller than many expected, especially with Hyundai’s $17,000 in lease cash factored in. And if you’re tempted by an upgrade, the SEL RWD trim is just $50 more per month under the same terms. You’ll get a model that’s roughly $7,000 more in value and $18,750 in savings.

The IONIQ 5 SE RWD Standard Range offers an EPA-estimated 245 miles of range, and this particular offer is available in the Los Angeles and greater California metro areas.

Other post-tax credit lease price changes

BMW has held steady with its EV lease prices. CarsDirect pointed out that the 2025 BMW i4 is now cheaper to lease than a 2026 Tesla Model 3 despite the former having an MSRP that’s $20,000 higher than the latter.

The 2024 Acura ZDX used to be one of the best EV lease deals around, but Acura discontinued lease offers on the EV more than a month ago. That’s likely because the company is dropping the model for the foreseeable future and it’s pretty much sold out.

Tesla’s most affordable EV, the 2026 Tesla Model 3 sedan, is up to 36% more expensive to lease than before. The new entry-level Standard Model 3 and Model Y trims can’t be leased.

VW leases lost up to $12,000 in discounts after the federal tax credits were killed off. CarsDirect found that 2025 VW ID.4 lease prices went from an effective cost of a little over $230 a month to an eye-watering $800 a month.

While Duke Energy customers will fund these new gas-burning power plants through increases on their monthly utility bills, the electricity generated will largely go to power-hungry large-load customers, like data centers, for multi-billion dollar tech companies.

Around 100 people spoke out in opposition to the project through online comments and two public hearings on the project. The NCUC did not require Duke to consider alternative options for power generation at the site, even though the state’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal remains the law.

Recent independent analysis concludes that North Carolina utility customers could pay an additional $23 billion by 2050 based on planned gas plants, just in fuel costs alone. Separate independent analysis concludes that the price of both new and used gas plants is quickly increasing due to a surge in demand and lack of supply, and these cost increases are outpacing inflation and likely to persist.

Earlier this month, Duke Energy released its updated long-range energy plan, which calls for burning coal longer at existing power plants and building even more new gas-burning power plants. Duke Energy is also slashing renewable energy investments, limiting potential cost-savings to customers by placing artificial caps on benefits. Last week, the NCUC heard from a variety of stakeholders about the merits of potential large load tariffs intended to protect existing customers from the multi-billion dollar costs of building new power plants, substations, transmission lines and other infrastructure to serve the needs of new data centers and other new customers who require significant electricity. What comes next is up to state utility regulators.

Statement from Steph Gans, Assistant Director at Clean Water for North Carolina:

“Local residents, expert witnesses, and even a county economic development leader identified this gas plant as being important for serving big industrial customers, like data centers. The area nearby already lives with contaminated ground water from Duke Energy’s coal ash and is still recovering from Tropical Storm Chantal. Why should regular customers pay for this?”

Statement from Olive Burress, North Carolina Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer with the Sierra Club:

“New power plants being built based on the needs of new data centers should not be subsidized via increased monthly utility bills for hard-working North Carolina families and businesses. It is absolutely critical that the NCUC supports strong safeguards for existing customers as new customers drastically increase demand for electricity.”

DALLAS – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 6 Administrator Scott Mason penned a Letter to the Editor in the Tangi Times outlining the agency’s cleanup efforts in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana following the Smitty’s Supply Inc. fire in August. For almost two months, over 450 EPA personnel and contractors worked around the clock to clean up the Tangipahoa River, nearby ponds, and Smitty’s Supply, including removing more than 11 million gallons of oily material. From day one, the Trump EPA worked in partnership with the community—who showed remarkable cooperation and resilience—in restoring their land, water, and way of life.

On October 15, 2025, EPA entered into a consent order with Smitty’s Supply Inc., requiring the company to take responsibility for cleanup and to pay certain response costs incurred by the United States. The agency issued a Pollution Removal Funding Authorization to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to continue cleanup of the Tangipahoa River and nearby ponds. EPA will continue to serve as a federal partner, continuing strict oversight as the cleanup progresses.

Read what Regional Administrator Scott Mason had to say:

“The fire at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in August disrupted life in Tangipahoa Parish. Families temporarily left their homes, Highway 51 closed to through traffic, and concerns arose about potential impacts to the Tangipahoa River—a treasured resource for your Sportsman’s Paradise. The weeks following the incident brought understandable questions and concerns for the community.

“Through it all, the people of Tangipahoa Parish have responded with remarkable cooperation and resilience, demonstrating the strength of Louisiana communities when they come together.

“From the moment the fire broke out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been your partner. Our emergency responders arrived immediately, working alongside local firefighters to extinguish the flames and stabilize the facility. As the scope of the environmental impact became clear, EPA transitioned to lead the cleanup efforts—and Tangipahoa Parish welcomed us with open arms. Neighbors like Nancy Clement and Miss Charlene opened their properties as staging areas for river operations. Parish President Miller and local officials coordinated tirelessly with our federal teams. This spirit of cooperation has been the foundation of every gallon recovered, and every mile of river restored.

“The progress has been substantial. Working around the clock with over 450 EPA personnel and contractors, we've recovered more than 11 million gallons of oily material—with over 7 million gallons already removed for disposal. Cleanup is complete for nearly 16 miles of the Tangipahoa River, representing over 30% of the impacted area. Daily recovery rates have more than doubled, from 85,000 to 175,000 gallons per day, thanks to new equipment including drum skimmers, rope skimmers, and marsh excavators. 22,400 feet of containment boom and nearly 5,000 bales of sorbent material line the waterways, capturing contamination before it can spread.

“Perhaps most importantly, when recent heavy rains tested our response systems, our stormwater controls worked.

“EPA is announcing a clear path forward that ensures accountability and continued progress. We have entered into a consent order with Smitty's Supply requiring the company to clean up the facility, properly dispose of contaminated materials, and prevent further releases. EPA will maintain close oversight of this work. At the same time, we are issuing a Pollution Removal Funding Authorization to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to continue cleanup of the Tangipahoa River and nearby ponds, with EPA remaining as the federal on-scene coordinator and funding support coming from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.

“This coordinated approach, with Smitty’s handling the facility, the state leading river and pond cleanup under our oversight, and Tangipahoa Parish serving as local coordinator, ensures the work continues efficiently while holding the responsible party accountable.

“EPA brings proven expertise to this challenge. Earlier this year, we completed the largest wildfire cleanup in our agency’s history after the Los Angeles fires, clearing over 13,000 properties of hazardous material in under 30 days. Following Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, EPA managed the safe recovery and recycling of 20,000 gallons of oil and contaminated fluids. That same determination and innovation is being applied right here in Roseland.

“The road ahead requires continued partnership. Our crews are managing the recent sheen reported near Lee’s Landing —waiting for conditions to improve after dangerous rainfall before resuming river operations in coordination with the Coast Guard. Ongoing water and sediment sampling will guide our next steps. Highway 51 must remain closed near the facility for everyone's safety as heavy equipment continues moving materials offsite, but we are working aggressively with the responsible party—Smitty’s Supply—and the parish on completing the cleanup work needed for the highway to reopen.

“Make no mistake, EPA is committed to remaining a partner throughout cleanup efforts. We will continue finding innovative ways to accelerate cleanup. We will continue our community office hours where we've already met with more than 2,200 residents. And we will continue protecting what makes Tangipahoa Parish special—your land, your water, and your way of life.

“This is more than a federal cleanup operation. It's a promise to restore what was damaged and a partnership that will endure long after the last gallon is recovered. The people of Tangipahoa Parish have been exceptional partners from day one. EPA will continue to be yours.”",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 16:19:53.714908

Applying Zero Trust to the Power Grid Implementing Zero Trust in a utility environment doesn’t mean replacing every router or rebuilding every subnet.","The North American grid powers nearly every aspect of life across the continent.

But this interconnectedness, and the reliance that businesses, governments, and households have upon it, also creates an attack surface that cyber actors can target for disruption or ransomware. This attack surface is becoming increasingly complex as the electric sector continues to modernize through digital transformation.

In response to the growing threats, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has recently approved NERC CIP-015-1, a new cybersecurity standard designed to mitigate risks associated with communications networks used in bulk electric system (BES) operations. This move recognizes that perimeter-based security models alone do not protect these critical systems from cyber threats. One solution utilities can adopt is a Zero Trust security architecture to secure their data and operations.

The Expanding Threat Landscape for Power Utilities

Power companies face a unique combination of technical and security challenges. Most notably, many operational technology systems are decades old and don’t have modern security controls. These legacy devices often lack native authentication or encryption features and were never intended to be exposed to the internet or enterprise IT networks. However, digital transformation, cloud environments, and smart grid technologies have increased the pathways into these systems.

Compounding the problem is the growing reliance on third-party systems and service providers, all of whom require access to systems and data. Each new connection increases the attack surface, so just one misconfigured remote session or stolen credential can provide an attacker with a foothold deep within a critical system.

Aligning with NERC CIP-015-1 with Zero Trust

The FERC’s adoption of CIP-015-1 is a significant step forward for power grid cybersecurity. The CIP-015-1 standard emphasizes protecting communications networks used for Bulk Electric System (BES) operations, including identifying and securing external connectivity, monitoring network traffic for anomalies, and ensuring segmentation between critical and non-critical systems.

For many utilities, achieving compliance will require a careful balance between modernizing infrastructure and maintaining reliability. Simply isolating networks will not be practical, as operational data still needs to flow for visibility and decision-making purposes. Instead, a more nuanced approach that integrates security controls around the assets themselves can help utilities comply without overhauling existing architectures.

This is where Zero Trust principles align naturally with the FERC's regulatory goals. Rather than assuming trust within a network, Zero Trust enforces continuous verification for every user, device, and data flow, regardless of origin. By embedding these principles into the network architecture, utilities can strengthen their cybersecurity posture while meeting or exceeding compliance mandates.

Applying Zero Trust to the Power Grid

Implementing Zero Trust in a utility environment doesn’t mean replacing every router or rebuilding every subnet. Instead, it’s about introducing logical segmentation and ""least privilege"" access controls for each application at the data layer. This implementation approach allows utilities to virtually compartmentalize critical systems, enforce strict internal network boundaries, and protect assets, all without disrupting existing networks.

Once implemented, a Zero Trust security architecture gives a utility provider:

Micro-segmentation of critical assets: The creation of secure, isolated “zones of trust” or “virtual DMZs” around essential assets, such as substations and SCADA applications, ensures that even if an attacker breaches into one segment, they cannot easily move to others.

Identity-based access control: Network-level access is replaced with continuous user- and device-level authentication based on specific roles and needs.

Encrypted communications: Encryption and continuous policy enforcement secure traffic between IT and OT systems as well as between utilities and third parties.

Real-time anomaly detection: Continuous monitoring of network patterns can help detect suspicious behavior early, such as abnormal remote logins.

With these measures, even if an attacker compromises one endpoint, they encounter immediate barriers.

Securing the Grid Without Renetworking

Adopting a Zero Trust approach does not require a complete network redesign. Modern network overlays enable utilities to enforce access policies across geographically distributed assets, such as power plants and remote substations, without requiring costly overhauls of networking equipment.

By applying software-defined controls at a segmented network edge or the application layer, utilities can incrementally implement Zero Trust protections around their critical digital assets, even with redundant deployment models. This modular approach minimizes operational disruption while mitigating the risk that an initially successful attack can spread.

Take a More Resilient Path

Cyber threats to the power grid will continue to evolve, meaning the security architectures that utility companies utilize must also be capable of adapting to these changes. FERC’s new standards and the Zero Trust security architecture that supports them provide a set of proactive and layered protections that utilities can utilize to rise to the challenge.

However, adopting Zero Trust principles is not merely a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic shift toward resilience. By compartmentalizing critical assets, enforcing identity-based access controls, and encrypting key communications, the power sector can establish a more secure and reliable foundation for the nation’s energy future.","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/10/68f00c21dd16226ba81e0115-dreamstime_m_382523726.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-20 16:19:41.515475

Indianapolis, IN – Indiana officials are reminding residents this week that burning fall leaves is not only outdated but harmful to air quality and community health.

According to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), open burning releases pollutants that can worsen respiratory issues and contribute to poor air quality statewide. The agency is encouraging Hoosiers to choose cleaner, more sustainable methods to manage yard waste this fall.

Instead of burning, IDEM recommends residents “leave the leaves” in place to decompose naturally or use a mulching mower to return nutrients to the soil. Composting is another option — combining yard and food waste to create nutrient-rich compost for gardens.

Residents can also take advantage of local yard waste pickup programs or drop leaves at designated compost sites, including the Valparaiso Compost Site, which accepts yard debris from Porter County residents.

,EVs,2025-10-20 18:46:13+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Here's why used EV prices are in line with pre-owned gas-powered cars - Chicago Tribune,The Detroit News,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/20/ev-prices/,"“It’s important, because one of the biggest barriers for adoption is price,” Valdez Streaty said.
But they’re already pretty low, so they probably won’t drop too much more.” Why are used EV prices so low?
“So we may see some of the used EV prices start to come down, and that will help sales of those vehicles.
“And so the used EV prices were lower than a comparable gas vehicle.
“The used EV market is very small right now,” said Cox Automotive spokesperson Mark Schirmer in an email, “but certainly growing as the new EV market grows.","Heavy discounts on new electric vehicles and buyer skepticism about their durability continue to push down used EV prices, which experts say has opened up a traditionally pricey market to more U.S. drivers.

While new EVs on average cost $9,000 more than similar gas models, prices on used EVs now are competitive with their internal combustion counterparts at about $680 higher on average, Cox Automotive EV analyst Stephanie Valdez Streaty said: The used market “is one area where you can find affordable EVs.”

In September, the average transaction price for a new EV was $58,124, while the average listing price for a used EV was $34,575, according to Cox Automotive. The lower price tags could be key to winning over an unenthusiastic U.S. market, which has been further dampened by the Trump administration’s move to roll back greenhouse gas regulations and end federal EV tax credits.

“It’s important, because one of the biggest barriers for adoption is price,” Valdez Streaty said.

Retired Naples, Florida, resident Jon Peter Vollmer, 65, owns two used Chevrolet Bolts, including a 2020 model he bought earlier this year for $7,500. At the time of purchase, Vollmer said the Bolt had been driven 45,000 miles.

For comparison, Kelley Blue Book values a used 2020 Honda Civic sedan at about $14,000 and a 2020 Toyota Camry at roughly $15,000.

“The cost was so incredible,” Vollmer said. “They were much more cost-effective.”

It’s unclear how the loss of $7,500 tax credits for new EV buyers and lessees will impact new vehicle prices, and in turn used EV prices, analysts said. A credit of up-to-$4,000 for used EV purchases also expired Sept. 30, but other factors so far have meant steep depreciation for used battery-powered models.

“Some of the prices on used EVs are just nuts,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. “And so there are some really good deals to be had up there, and they may get a little bit better in the coming months. But they’re already pretty low, so they probably won’t drop too much more.”

Why are used EV prices so low?

Discounts on new EVs, the draw of new tech featured in new models, and lack of consumer confidence in the lifespan of EV batteries are top factors driving used values down, Valdez Streaty said in an emaill.

“Automakers are cutting prices and offering substantial lease incentives to stay competitive,” she said. “In many cases, a new EV — after discounts — costs less than a used one, which puts downward pressure on resale values.”

Issues with early model EV batteries also have lingered in buyers’ minds, analysts said, hurting used sales in particular. First-generation Nissan Leaf batteries degraded more quickly because they lacked pricier battery coolers, Abuelsamid said. He said 2026 Leaf models will have updated cooling systems — which many other EV brands have offered for years — that should help battery lifespan.

“Pretty much all of the other EVs, after 10 years they typically have at least around 90% of their original capacity,” Abuelsamid said. “Manufacturers, apart from Nissan with the first Leaf, they have been very careful with the thermal management of the battery, because what causes the battery degradation most of the time is overheating the battery.”

Battery life is “not really something that consumers should be worried about,” Abuelsamid said.

Consumer confidence in the durability of EVs and the longevity of their batteries — by far the most expensive component — likely will grow with time, Valdez Streaty said.

“When we’re able to show these batteries are really good and are going to last a long time, that’s going to help also with the depreciations of EVs,” she said.

How long will prices stay low?

Prices on used EVs will increase or decrease depending on demand and how new EVs are priced, analysts said. Demand rose in recent months, spurred by pull-ahead sales from buyers and lessees hoping to take advantage of the EV tax credit before it expired.

Used EV sales so far this year were up 76% as of September compared to the same time period last year, according to Valdez Streaty.

In response, used EV values also grew more than 6% in September compared to the same time last year, according to wholesale used vehicle auctioneer Manheim. Gas-powered vehicles saw a 1% hike in appreciation during the same period.

“The expiration of federal tax credits created a short-term demand spike that helped stabilize values,” Valdez Streaty said in an email.

“Consumers kept the pace of new and used EV purchases high over the quarter, prior to the expiration of the tax incentive,” said Jeremy Robb, deputy chief economist for Cox Automotive. “This heightened demand pushed EV wholesale values higher again (in September), making EVs the strongest-performing segment in year-over-year value appreciation.”

Moving forward, used EV prices will “depend a lot on how much automakers put prices on new EVs,” Abuelsamid said.

“If we see a bunch of price cuts, especially on existing models, that will hurt residual values,” Abuelsamid said. “So we may see some of the used EV prices start to come down, and that will help sales of those vehicles. EVs have always had, up until now, a lot of depreciation anyway, in part because the tax credits went to the new car buyers. Until the (Inflation Reduction Act) came along, there were no incentives for buying a used EV.

“And so the used EV prices were lower than a comparable gas vehicle. We may see those prices come down even a little bit more in the coming months if we see more price cuts on new EVs, but it probably won’t go down too much more than it is now,” Abuelsamid said.

Another dip in prices could be coming in a few years. More drivers opted to lease EVs beginning in 2023, when the Inflation Reduction Act made tax incentives available to lessees regardless of income. U.S. drivers have leased roughly 1.1 million EVs since 2023, Valdez Streaty said. As lease terms end in the next several years, those vehicles will flood the used market.

“The used EV market is very small right now,” said Cox Automotive spokesperson Mark Schirmer in an email, “but certainly growing as the new EV market grows. The real acceleration is coming, in 2027 and 2028, when a heavy load of leased EVs come back to market, something we will be watching carefully.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-Z-EV-prices-01.jpg?w=1024&h=646,N,,2025-10-20 15:19:49.000882

Today, Sens. Ossoff and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) introduced the bipartisan American Energy SecurityAct to help cities and localities strengthen energy infrastructure and lower energy costs for families.

The bipartisan bill would formally authorize the Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure and Safety Modernization grant program, which provides Federal grant funding to help communities replace and upgrade critical infrastructure, improving the safe and reliable transportation of fuel to families and businesses.

The Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure and Safety Modernization grant program was created through the bipartisan infrastructure law but is set to expire. The bipartisan American Energy Security Act would formally authorize the grant program through 2029.

Sen. Ossoff has successfully delivered Federal funding through this grant program to communities across Georgia — including an historic $8.4 million grantThis is an external link to the City of Toccoa last year to replace aged, leaking natural gas pipes to lower energy costs and improve the reliability of services for small businesses and residents in the area — and to the cities of Lawrenceville, Hawkinsville, Buford, Winder, Hartwell, Tifton, Eatonton, Perry, and Thomasville.

“This legislation will strengthen Georgia’s energy security by helping our cities modernize infrastructure. I am leading this bipartisan legislation with Sen. Cassidy to protect families, support growth, and ensure reliable, safe energy for years to come,” Sen. Ossoff said.

“America and the world run on Louisiana natural gas,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We strengthen our country by strengthening our pipeline system.”

“The City of Toccoa was the recipient of an $8.5 million dollar grant award from the Bipartisan NGDISM Grant. This award allows our city to repair and replace aging gas lines providing a huge layer of protection for our community. We reached out to Senator Ossoff, and he led the way for our success in receiving the award. He understands the needs of small communities that have no resources for budgeting projects that are mandated by the federal government. This grant affects every citizen in our community by providing safety and enhancing quality of life,” said Gail Fry, former Mayor of Toccoa, GA. “The American Energy Security Act will provide opportunities for more communities to provide reliable and safe avenues for aging infrastructure.”

“Our 85 municipal gas utilities, and the communities they serve, are grateful for Senators Ossoff and Cassidy introducing the bipartisan, American Energy Security Act to authorize funding the very successful Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization (NGDISM) grant program. This important legislation provides needed investment in the modernization of existing public gas distribution pipelines across the nation ensuring the safety and longevity of existing pipeline infrastructure. Funding programs such as NGDISM create even more opportunities for jobs, improve pipeline safety, and reduce emissions,” said Arthur Corbin, President & CEO of the Gas Authority.

Dive Brief:

The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced Thursday they will no longer provide climate-related financial risk guidance to large banks and lenders.

The decision to rescind the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions comes after the OCC withdrew its participation from the framework in March. The guidance aimed to help banks managing over $100 billion in total assets identify and manage monetary risks related to climate change.

In a joint statement, the regulators said they do not believe the framework is necessary and expressed concerns that “such principles could distract from the management of other potential risks identified and addressed by financial institutions’ existing risk management processes and the agencies’ other risk management rules and guidance.”

Dive Insight:

The Fed, FDIC and OCC said their existing standards require supervised financial institutions to have an effective risk management process in place that is on par with the “size, complexity, and risk of their activities.” These standards, according to the agencies, already establish the expectation for banks to “consider and appropriately address all material risks in their operating environment … including emerging risks.”

The principles are no longer available on the websites of all three agencies as of Oct. 16.

The agencies established the principles in October 2023, under the Biden administration. At the time, the agencies said they aimed to provide banks with a “high-level framework for climate-related financial risk management consistent with the agencies’ existing rules and guidance.”

The decision to rescind the framework comes a few months after the banking regulators departed the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System. TheOCC left the global coalition that aims to mobilize green finance and develop recommendations for climate-risk management in the financial sector in February, following in the footsteps of the Federal Reserve,FDIC and the Treasury Department, who exited NGFS in January, around the time of President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Several climate and sustainability advocates have criticized the federal agencies’ decision to abandon the principles.

In an emailed statement sent to ESG Dive on Friday, Sarah Bloom Raskin — former deputy secretary of the Treasury, former Federal Reserve governor and current senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute — said the agencies’ backtracking “threatens the soundness of the country’s banks and [their] financial stability.”

“Pretending that climate change does not pose widespread financial consequences will not make their effects disappear. This decision leaves homeowners, businesses, and communities vulnerable as extreme weather events increase,” she added.

Sierra Club Sustainable Finance Campaign Adviser Jessye Waxman echoed the sentiment, noting in a Friday statement that “climate change poses a destabilizing, systemic threat to the financial system.”

“The science hasn’t changed, the risks have only worsened, and the best practices for banks are clearer than ever,” Waxman added. “The only relevant change is the administration in power, which shows that this reversal is a purely political move.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/VqNVw4tIfRY5gNXi-wGg7TYvFsTXRE1gdYt9fPgHxaE/g:nowe:0:62/c:1024:578/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy04Njk0ODc0MzYuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-20 20:03:56.319788

What’s going underneath the campus, however, has heads turning over geothermal technology and building energy use.

A series of geothermal pumps conditions the Epic campus almost entirely on their own, with a geothermal network running as deep as 500 feet and containing thousands of miles of piping. Many pipes only transport water, while gas infrastructure is used for a few special heating applications.

Epic said it has one of the largest geothermal systems in the world, and the campus serves as a case study for the U.S. Department of Energy.

The campus, located in Verona, Wis., has around 40 connected buildings and has around 9 million square feet of building space, DOE officials said. The campus is around 1,670 acres and has enough auditorium space to seat around 18,000 people, a campus fact sheet showed.

The geothermal system includes four bore fields with more than 6,000 wells, a stormwater lake and a quarry lake to trap heat, and cooling support for a 3.5-megawatt data center. Salas O’Brien, a national engineering firm, designed and implemented the renewable energy system more than a decade ago. The system project is ongoing, according to the engineering firm.

The geothermal system is complemented by heat reduction through rooftop gardens, wind turbines, solar photovoltaics and energy-efficient building envelopes, DOE officials said. With those elements combined, campus buildings consume around 25% less energy than other commercial buildings in the same climate, they added.

“Beyond the energy savings, the geothermal system has resulted in goodwill from the local community and the worldwide healthcare network. It also resonates with the talent Epic seeks to recruit,” said Derek Schnabel, facilities director at Epic, in a statement.

Epic develops medical record software used by 305 million patients across the U.S. Serving healthcare patients requires around-the-clock operations, and the company said its geothermal systems helps meet that standard of reliability.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison has monitored Epic’s geothermal system since it was installed in 2012. Researchers track air and soil temperatures, subsurface water flow and water levels in the quarry pond to understand system performance, DOE officials said.

The 80-page document says that the government wants to create a new generation of skilled jobs that are located in every corner of the country, with decent pay and the very best workers’ rights.

""Someone is going to win the global race for the clean energy jobs of the future and we are determined that it should be the UK. The job opportunities on offer are huge"", it reads, saying that by 2030 the UK will be a global leader in clean energy sector talent.

However, it conceded that the UK has fallen behind. Germany, Sweden and Denmark have three-to-five times as many renewable energy jobs per capita, the Jobs Plan says, based on data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The report also suggested the UK has seen ""significant underinvestment"" in the sector compared with European peers.

Key deliverables: delivering a skilled worker pipeline

To deliver the pipeline of skilled workers, the government says it will align the skills system and employment support to its Industrial Strategy sectors, including Clean Power 2030. That includes an additional £1.2 billion per year to support skills development over the course of the parliament, including over £100 million into the Engineering Skills Package.

It will also establish five Clean Energy Technical Excellence Colleges (TECs) to specialise in training skilled clean energy workforces for local and national businesses, which is on top of the ten Construction TECs already confirmed.

The UK already has a large energy workforce but this is largely focused on the oil and gas sectors in the North Sea. The government will provide up to £20 million of funding from UK and Scottish government to aid the transition of North Sea workers into clean energy sectors.

It will also deliver up to £2.5 million in funding across 2025-26 for regional skills interventions in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire to support those looking to move into the clean energy sector. All three are counties with a lot of large-scale solar PV development activity.

It will also work with trade bodies RenewableUK and Offshore Energies UK to expand the Energy Skills Passport, develop and promote new pathways for veterans into clean energy and work with the Department for Work and Pensions to encourage reforms to the employment system to deliver for the clean energy sector.

Ensuring ‘clean energy jobs are always good jobs’

To ensure jobs are well-paid with good workers rights, the government will support greater trade union recognition and promote collective bargaining across the clean energy sector.

That includes developing a fair work charter with the wind sector and trade unions, and embedding the role of trade unions within policy-making through various forums and partnerships.

It will also look to improve the inclusivity and visibility of clean energy job opportunities through a new Social Inclusion Forum and an industry-led public awareness campaign.

Delivering regional equity

The Jobs Plan also says the government will deliver funding—although it didn’t say how much—to Local Net Zero Hubs to build a regional picture of clean energy skills and jobs with local authorities.

It will co-develop guidance addressing the Clean Energy Superpower Mission and clean energy skills to support the next cycle of Local Skills Improvement Plans, and establish a Skills Forum and a Net Zero Network to bring together representatives of Industrial Strategy Zones across the UK.

The government will also work closely with Local Growth Plans and utilise the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s (DESNZ's) Local Net Zero Delivery Group and Mayoral Roundtables to identify opportunities for collaboration and alignment between central and regional government.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt864e32313783fe03/blt0e6c457654397d34/68f6165a78a7fc7bae1f752a/Screenshot_2025-10-20_115956.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-20 15:19:53.218094

MIT President Sally Kornbluth was the first to decline, telling Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a letter that “fundamentally, the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone.” Others echoed this sentiment, reaffirming their commitments to core institutional values such as academic freedom and fair admissions processes.

On Oct. 12, President Trump opened up the offer to all higher education institutions in a Truth Social post. The institutions included in the original offer that had not yet rejected it were reportedly invited to a meeting on Friday afternoon. The meeting invite was also extended to Arizona State University, the University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis.

At the time of publication, no university had yet agreed to the compact, though there are indications the University of Texas at Austin was considering it, with Chairman of the UT System Board of Regents, Kevin Eltife, saying he was “honored” that the institution had been selected for potential funding advantages. UT faculty and students have expressed opposition to the university joining the compact.

Judge halts shutdown RIFs

A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting a mass firing of federal employees during the government shutdown. Judge Susan Illston sided with labor unions representing federal employees last week, saying the administration’s use of reduction-in-force notices during a shutdown is transparently politically motivated and likely a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration has issued more than 4,000 RIF notices to federal employees since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

For now, the administration may not enforce any RIFs to programs that employ union members or issue more such RIFs. Defendants were given two business days to disclose details on all “actual or imminent” RIFs, which are now available in the court docket. A hearing on the case is scheduled to take place on Oct. 28.

In her written opinion, Illston stated it is “far from normal for an administration to fire line-level civilian employees during a government shutdown as a way to punish the opposing political party. But that is precisely what President Trump has announced he is doing.”

Meanwhile in Congress, the Senate failed to pass a continuing resolution bill to temporarily fund the government for the tenth time last week. Senate Democrats also voted Thursday to block the fiscal year 2026 defense appropriations bill, instead pushing for a broader deal to resolve the shutdown.

Also last week, the Pentagon reportedly filled its $8 billion payroll for troops by tapping into unspecified R&D funds following an order from President Trump. The Senate is scheduled to meet this week to vote on legislation to keep paying the military and other federal workers who are required to keep working during the shutdown.

Harvard research funding restored

Harvard University has now recovered most of its federal research grants that were cancelled by the Trump administration, The Boston Globe reports. Earlier this year, the Trump administration froze more than $2.6 billion dollars in research grants to Harvard, citing concerns that the institution had failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus — a charge the university has denied. A federal judge ruled on Sept. 3 that the funding freeze was illegal and ordered the Trump administration to restore the funding. It was unclear how long the reinstatement of funds would take given the government shutdown.

While most of Harvard’s research grants have now been reinstated, Harvard School of Public Health Dean Andrea Baccarelli sent an email last week urging faculty to remain cautious about hiring “given continued uncertainty and the potential for funds to be disrupted again,” according to reporting by The Harvard Crimson. Harvard last week reported an operating loss of $113 million in fiscal year 2025 as of June, with University President Alan Garber reportedly describing the year as “extraordinarily challenging, with political and economic disruption affecting many sectors, including higher education.”

Background

The original text of the preparatory plans was contained within a 360-page document submitted on October 8 by General Electric Company (GE). The company was charged with remediating the Housatonic River after decades of depositing now-banned toxic chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), into the waterway from its Pittsfield plant. The Superfund project for the Rest of River—the cleanup of the Housatonic River from its east and west confluence in Pittsfield to Connecticut—stems from a 2020 agreement between the EPA, GE, and five affected towns. The settlement provides that the materials dredged from the waterway with the highest toxicity will be routed out of the area while the remaining lesser-contaminated dredged soil and sediment will be transported to a to-be-constructed upland disposal facility (UDF) in Lee, near October Mountain. The measure has long been opposed by Lee residents as a health hazard to the town’s citizens and way of life.

The EPA is tasked with reviewing and approving all documents submitted in conjunction with the project, including the October 8 Upland Disposal Facility Site Preparation Supplemental Information Package (SIP) submission. A copy of the submission can be found here.

Although GE’s revised Final Design Plan and Operation, Monitoring, and Maintenance Plan for the UDF was conditionally approved by the EPA in March, the agency nixed a formal public comment period on the October 8 plan to prepare that site for construction, with the preparation project set to begin in early November.

Explaining the timeline

In its October 16 statement, the EPA extended the deadline for it to submit agency comments to the SIP, or UDF preparation plan, to October 31, to “allow more time for the public to provide input.”

According to the EPA, the UDF site preparation work will begin on November 3 as preparation items are moved to the area, erosion controls are created, and trees cleared. The required asbestos abatement and removal of associated waste in existing house structures on the property will occur before those buildings are demolished, followed by the installation of two temporary construction entrances, tree-clearing activities, fencing work, utility additions, and waterline action.

The project’s tree-clearing activities is at the crux of the timeline issue since those actions are governed by the date bats roost in the area.

Drafted by EPA Community Involvement Coordinator Olivia Lopez, the clarification offered the agency’s reasoning for the short timeline as being “necessary to ensure that the remedial schedule remains on time and that the potential rare bat species are not affected by the site preparation work.”

“In collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Wildlife, all tree clearing activities must be completed between November 1st and March 31st to avoid adverse impacts to potential roosting rare bats,” the statement provided. “To allow for sufficient time to complete the tree felling in 2025 as outlined in the SIP, GE must begin its work in November.”

The agency reiterated that the upcoming work “is not for the overall construction of the UDF and does not involve the handling of any contaminated material.” Additionally, the preparatory project will not change any components of the overall UDF design and an upcoming SIP detailing the UDF construction “will be available for public input.”

The preparation project is scheduled to end by January 2, but that date is subject to change due to weather and other factors.",https://berkshireedge-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-1.56.15%E2%80%AFPM.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:19:06.600643

This story was originally published by Canary Media.

A new law in Ohio will fast-track energy projects in places that are hard to argue with: former coal mines and brownfields.

But how much the legislation benefits clean energy will depend on the final rules for its implementation, which the state is working out now.

Ohio has more than 567,000 acres of mine lands and about 50,000 acres of brownfields that are potentially suitable for renewable-energy development, according to a 2024 report from The Nature Conservancy. Federal funding to clean up abandoned mine lands has continued so far under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, so yet more sites may become available. Overall, remediating documented hazards at Ohio’s abandoned mine lands is estimated to cost nearly $586 million, said spokesperson Karina Cheung at the state Department of Natural Resources.

The debate over HB 15 rules

Advocates and industry groups generally applaud the new law but want tweaks to the Power Siting Board’s proposed rules.

A big concern is making sure the board will allow wind and solar developments on mine lands and brownfields throughout Ohio, regardless of which county they’re in. Roughly one-third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both in all or a significant part of their jurisdiction. This authority was granted to them by a 2021 law, Senate Bill 52.

However, the language and legislative history of HB 15 make clear that it ​“was meant to be technology-neutral,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy.

HB 15 even states that its terms for permitting energy projects in priority investment areas apply ​“notwithstanding” some other parts of Ohio law.

“That clause is meant to bypass some of the typical Ohio Power Siting Board procedures — including the procedures for siting in restricted areas” under SB 52, wrote Bill Stanley, Ohio director for The Nature Conservancy, in comments filed with the board.

But the exemption provided by the ​“notwithstanding” clause is narrow, Mellino added, because local government authorities must ask for a priority investment area designation. That means, for example, that in a county with a solar and wind ban in place, officials would need to choose to request that a former coal mine or brownfield become a priority investment area.

The Nature Conservancy has asked the Power Siting Board to add language making it crystal-clear that renewable-energy projects can be built on any land marked a priority investment area — even if a solar and wind ban otherwise exists in a county.

Industry groups are pushing for additional clarifications to make sure the Power Siting Board meets the permitting deadlines set by the new law, both for expedited and standard projects.

For example, Open Road Renewables, which builds large-scale solar and battery storage, said in comments that, in order to align with HB 15, the board’s rules should require energy developers to notify the public of an application when it is filed, rather than after it is deemed complete.

Separate comments from the American Clean Power Association, MAREC Action, and the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio ask for tweaks to provisions regarding notices on public hearings and for clarifications on application fees. The board should also promptly issue certificates for projects that are automatically approved, say comments by Robert Brundrett, president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.

The Department of Development hopes to finish draft standards and invite public comments on them soon, Waldvogel said. Meanwhile, the department has received its first request to designate a priority investment area. The ask comes from Jefferson County’s board of commissioners, which did not specify the type of energy that may be built in the area.

That request deals with land where FirstEnergy’s former Sammis coal plant is undergoing demolition, as well as the Hollow Rock Landfill, which received waste from the site. HB 15 gives the department 90 days to act on designation requests.

The Ohio Power Siting Board, for its part, is expected to finalize its rules within the next couple of months. Ultimately, said Cherry of MAREC Action, the law ​“clears the path for developers to bring energy projects online quickly and affordably, something Ohio’s consumers and businesses desperately need.”

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband highlighted that the initiative will prioritise skilled trades such as plumbers, electricians, welders, and carpenters, with thousands of additional positions projected by 2030.

The plan targets a broad range of job seekers, including school leavers, unemployed individuals, veterans, ex-offenders, and those transitioning from fossil fuel industries. Public grants and contracts will be linked to requirements for creating high-quality jobs and supporting trade union recognition and collective bargaining, including in offshore roles.

A total of 31 skilled trades have been designated as recruitment priorities, with heating, ventilation, and plumbing roles expected to see the highest demand. The government is also investing in five new technical excellence colleges and regional skills pilots, backed by £2.5 million, to support training and career development.

Additional programmes will help match veterans and other jobseekers with opportunities in solar panel installation, wind turbine production, nuclear power, and other clean energy sectors. Existing oil and gas workers will also benefit from bespoke upskilling programmes supported by up to £20 million from the UK and Scottish governments.

Unions, including Unite and GMB have welcomed the plan, emphasising the importance of well-paid, secure work and strong collective bargaining rights in supporting the green transition. The initiative aims to signal both to industry and regional authorities where workforce development and training investments should be focused to meet the future demand for clean energy jobs.

The project received the funding conditionally from the Biden-era department’s Loan Programs Office in January, as part of a $23-billion package offered to eight utilities to support investments in transmission, energy storage, grid upgrades and gas pipelines.

The AEP funds gained final approval by the now renamed ""Energy Dominance Financing Program,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said during a media briefing on Oct. 15, noting he was “happy to move forward"" to support the work, which is claimed to generate 1,000 construction jobs.

RBC has cut its 2030 forecast for EV adoption in the US in half, from 35 percent to 17 percent, saying that the main constraint is the lack of public charging infrastructure — especially fast Level 3 chargers.
While EV penetration forecasts in Europe have dropped from 50 percent to 40 percent, unlike in the United States, regulatory mandates require a certain share of EV sales.
In September, global EV sales reached 2.1 million, hitting a monthly record.","In 2017, the CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra, committed the automaker to zero emissions by 2030.

“No more gas. No more diesel. No more carbon emissions,” she wrote at the time.

Following the lead of Barra of GM, Ford announced in 2018 that it planned to nearly triple its investments in electric and hybrid vehicles by 2022, with plans for 40 new such models…

But a series of challenges — cost concerns, sluggish adoption and the reversal in support in Washington — has left the U.S. auto industry with greater uncertainty about its EV future.

“Penetration has stalled,” said David Whiston, a senior analyst at Morningstar investment research company who covers autos. (NBC News)

We saw evidence of the slowdown last week, when General Motors said it will incur a $1.6 billion loss to scale back its electric vehicle (EV) operations, citing weaker expected demand due to recent US policy changes, including the end of federal EV tax credits and loosened emissions rules. (Zero Hedge)

On Sept. 30, the federal EV tax credit expired as part of a broader anti-EV mandate by the Trump administration. The credit started in 2008 and was expanded under the Biden administration. It had been a key driver of EV sales in the US.

In Bécancour, Quebec, the planned expansion of a battery facility was put on hold. The first phase of the project, called Ultium CAM, a partnership between General Motors and Korean steel manufacturer POSCO, is under construction, with the $600 million facility due to open in 2026.

But according to Energy Now, A spokesperson for General Motors Canada said Thursday that the company is pausing the second phase of a project to produce cathode active materials for electric-vehicle batteries… The decision was made “in light of evolving market dynamics,” according to spokesperson Marie Binette.

As a result of that decision, Brazilian mining giant Vale SA has scrapped plans for a nickel sulfate plant that would have supplied the second phase of the Ultium CAM project. In a statement, Vale Base Metals said GM “will not need nickel sulfate in Quebec at this time.”

As my Oilprice colleague Irina Slav wrote on Oct. 14, US EV sales surged a record 40% in the third quarter, driven by a rush to buy before the $7,500 federal tax credit expired on Sept. 30.

The push to buy EVs ahead of subsidy expiry followed a dismal second quarter, when new EV sales declined by 6.3% year on year, according to Cox Automotive, which said the growth trajectory for EVs “has been curbed.”

The end of subsidies threatens the EV industry’s profitability, with Ford, GM, and Stellantis all losing money on electric models.

BloombergNEF says 14 million fewer EVs could be sold by 2030 under current policies.

“Demand has grown more slowly than expected, and that’s likely to continue given the elimination of consumer incentives and regulatory changes,” said James Cain, executive director for finance and sales communications at GM, quoted by Rob Wile, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at NBC News.

He notes that even before Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” ended the EV subsidy, signs of EV fatigue among US consumers had begun to show:

A survey published in August 2024 by Edmunds automotive information group showed concerns about finding charging stations and charging times, availability and reliability as the top reasons consumers would not purchase EVs…

Ford CEO Jim Farley said this month that EV sales could fall by around 50% after the EV tax credits expire…

The entire U.S. auto market also remains challenged by affordability issues. The average price of a new car surpassed $50,000 for the first time last month, Kelley Blue Book reported Tuesday…

EVs currently cost about $7,000 more, according to Kelley Blue Book data.

In a recent article, RBC Capital Markets argued the EV slowdown in the US is mainly driven by the wide price gap between new and used EVs, with more buyers incentivized to choose used cars over newer models.

“There's a lot of attention on the culture wars and range anxiety, but what we think is really happening is used EV prices have come down so much that consumers in the U.S. are essentially not buying new EVs,” says Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst for Global Autos, RBC Capital Markets.

Used battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are now priced at around USD$30,000, making them price-equivalent to used internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.

Narayan says US tariffs could force EV makers to raise prices on new vehicles, expanding the gap between the prices of new versus used EVs.

RBC has cut its 2030 forecast for EV adoption in the US in half, from 35 percent to 17 percent, saying that the main constraint is the lack of public charging infrastructure — especially fast Level 3 chargers.

According to consulting firm EY’s September 2025 “EY Mobility Lens Forecaster,” an AI-powered modeling tool developed to predict electric vehicle adoption timelines in the key US, China and EU markets through 2050, via Wards Auto, the timeline to reach 50% EV adoption won’t happen now until 2039 — five years later than previously forecast.

The forecasting model found that Elimination of buyer incentives combined with regulatory uncertainty is expected to slow domestic electric vehicle adoption as the technology advances in other global markets.

Indeed, the US EV slowdown has not been duplicated in Europe and China.

While EV penetration forecasts in Europe have dropped from 50 percent to 40 percent, unlike in the United States, regulatory mandates require a certain share of EV sales.

China continues to lead the EV race with a major cost advantage in battery production and market penetration rates two to three times higher than in the US, according to RBC.

In September, global EV sales reached 2.1 million, hitting a monthly record. China alone accounted for 1.3 million sales.

The withdrawal of federal grants is likely to set back environmental justice efforts in Rhode Island by years.","PROVIDENCE — More than half a year after the Trump administration canceled or rescinded billions of dollars in federal grants, some environmental justice efforts continue to stall in Rhode Island as a result.

The Environmental Protection Agency in the last year of the Biden administration awarded about $22 million to six different state agencies and local nonprofits to fund, among other things, the state’s compost capacity, to build awareness of lead service pipes transporting drinking water, and to study asthma in Rhode Island.

Much of the funding came from two signature legislative achievements of the Biden administration: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Build Back Better Act.

Those two pieces of legislation ensured billions in federal funding began flowing to Rhode Island for a number of environmental-related projects that never had federal funding before.

But the Trump administration this past spring embarked on a campaign of slashing or rolling back much of the spending from the Biden acts, including money for environmental justice grants.

The federal freeze hit close to home.

The Rhode Island Food Policy Council, which last year was awarded an $18.7 million environmental justice community grant from the EPA, laid off three staff members due to the Trump administration rescinding federal money.

“The work of the Rhode Island Food Policy Council depends in part on federal grants which are now frozen,” wrote the Providence-based nonprofit in an April newsletter announcing the layoffs. “As a result, and with heavy hearts, we made the difficult decision to cut three valuable staff positions.”

Farm Fresh Rhode Island, the state’s chief food incubator hub since 2004, has seen the brunt of federal funding cuts firsthand: 40% of its budget comes from the federal government, and it’s the designated administrative entity for a number of U.S. Department of Agriculture grants and programs.

Delite Primus, advancement director for Farm Fresh, said two USDA-funded programs were cut early in March: the Local Food Purchasing Agreement and the Local Food for Schools program, both of which facilitate procurement of locally grown produce for use in food pantries and school meal programs.

Primus said Farm Fresh expected to get another $3 million total for both programs; around $1.7 million for the school purchasing program and another $1.25 million for the local food purchasing agreement. A portion of the money set aside to buy local food for schools was designated for early childhood education centers, a new expansion to the program Primus said was added last fall.

“A lot of the local fruit and vegetable farmers, the fisheries, the food producers around the state, a lot of them are smaller farmers that were benefiting from this,” Primus said. “They have really been able to grow their operations because of these markets, and the funding that was available to support these purchases.”

As a result of the USDA cuts, Primus said Farm Fresh had to lay off four people related to the local purchasing grants, an unusual move in the nonprofit space, where it’s rare for funding that had been previously awarded to get cut.

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management received a $944,618 Environmental Justice Government-to-Government grant, which the agency was going to use to support local nonprofits engaged in environmental justice initiatives. The EPA notified DEM on March 31 that the federal agency would be terminating the remainder of the grant.

A spokesperson for DEM told ecoRI News the agency submitted a letter disputing the withdrawal of funds, but the EPA ultimately denied the dispute letter on Oct. 2, writing that “it is within the Agency’s discretion to determine that a given grant award no longer effectuates the program goals of Agency priorities and to terminate the award.”

“Before the grant was terminated, DEM was able to spend $355,101.57 in grant awards,” said Kim Keough, DEM’s chief of public affairs.

That grant money was going to DEM’s Community Conversations initiative, where agency staff held public presentations and workshops about some of the legacy pollution lingering in the state’s air, land, and water.

The original grants were a big boost for local efforts for environmental justice issues in Rhode Island. In the past few years DEM has issued its own environmental justice policy and definitions, including a map of identified environmental justice areas around the state, but regulations with teeth and the force of law remain elusive.

Efforts in the General Assembly to enact environmental justice legislation have gone nowhere. The Environmental Justice Act, introduced annually by lawmakers in the House and Senate, would allow departments like DEM and the Coastal Resources Management Council to consider cumulative impacts when siting industrial projects.

Industrial and polluted areas, such as the Port of Providence, tend to exist in a positive-feedback loop. Once a single industrial or pollution-intensive industry sets up shop somewhere — typically a POC neighborhood, whose community members have little political power — it becomes much easier for like-minded industries to locate nearby.

The Environmental Justice Act would give another layer of authority to state agencies, allowing them to weigh the cumulative impact each new permit application will have on the surrounding area in tandem with existing businesses. Currently, DEM is only allowed to examine the impact a singular project will have on the area; anything more is likely to be overturned by the courts.

The withdrawal of federal grants is likely to set back environmental justice efforts in Rhode Island by years. Without federal dollars, many of the planned projects are unlikely to happen.

The Nature Conservancy of Rhode Island received $500,000 to address tree canopy inequities in and around the Providence area. The grant was rescinded by the Trump administration earlier this year, and The Nature Conservancy has filed no lawsuit in District Court to get the funds back.

A spokesperson for The Nature Conservancy declined to provide comment or details on the grant.",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SocialJustice.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:19:11.640742

Working with Swansea University, CGEN Engineering, the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult and Wave Venture, the initiative will deliver new hardware, testing and research infrastructure to advance the Anaconda’s readiness for sea trials at the Welsh Marine Energy Test Area (META).

Checkmate director Paul Auston said: “This grant allows us to accelerate the Anaconda’s development and build on the innovation our team has already delivered, with a clear path toward future sea trials. It’s an exciting step forward, not just for Checkmate, but for the future of wave energy in Wales and the Celtic Sea, where we see enormous potential to deliver clean, predictable power at scale.”

The Anaconda captures wave energy through a patented bulge-tube design comprising a reinforced natural rubber outer tube and hundreds of internal tendons made from high-performance rubber.

As waves travel along the flexible structure, they generate pressure bulges that move toward a power take-off system at the end of the tube, converting energy into electricity. The internal wave speed can be adjusted to maximise power production or survivability in rough conditions.

Dr Brian Mathew, MP and member of the Marine Energy All-Party Parliamentary Group, said: “I welcome this exciting news, and I’m pleased to see innovative solutions on renewable energy like this being well supported and funded. It’s testament to the incredible expertise we have here in Wiltshire, and I will be watching on keenly in the coming months and years to see how the Anaconda develops.”

Vice Admiral Sir Adrian Johns, KCB, CBE, KStJ, DL, said: “As a former seafarer, I am fully aware of the power of the sea and the as yet untapped potential for harnessing wave energy. Having followed Anaconda’s progress over many years from the earliest scale model water tank trials, I am delighted that this truly innovative project will now be able to take the next big step towards delivering clean, renewable energy at full scale.”

Over the next 18 months, the project will combine advanced numerical modelling with tank trials, materials testing and construction of a 1:4-scale prototype section.

Checkmate said the work will refine and validate the Anaconda’s design and create new resources for the wider wave energy sector.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations panel, and Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), the ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, called on the Trump administration in a Friday letter to “halt” all planned reductions in force and give them “detailed information” on potential layoffs.

“We write with outrage over the Department of Energy’s decision to move forward with reductions in force (RIFs) across critical program offices during the government shutdown in a clear act of political retribution that will hurt communities across the country,” Murray and Kaptur wrote in a letter to Energy Secretary Christopher Wright.

Murray is also ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.

They said the move, which will affect 179 employees, is part of a broader effort to “implement the administration’s budget request without congressional approval — circumventing the appropriations process and undermining congressional intent.”

The pair warned the layoffs would raise energy prices by disrupting the implementation of programs to increase supplies and reduce costs.

Murray and Kaptur said they were “alarmed” about how “mass firings might allow waste, fraud, and abuse as you eliminate key staff conducting oversight of programs.”

They wrote that the Energy Department has so far “refused to provide information” about the distribution of layoffs in offices such as the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office of State Community Energy Programs and the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Employees at those offices have been notified of impending terminations but have not been provided dates for when their jobs would end, creating “confusion and uncertainty throughout the department,” they noted.

“These RIFs would effectively dismantle the very offices responsible for lowering energy costs for American families and communities” and could jeopardize work to distribute $366 million per year through the Weatherization Assistance Program, which saves participating households an estimated $372 per year, they argued.

Murray and Kaptur warned the firings would end research and development programs in solar, wind and hydrogen technologies, undermining the affordability of clean energy programs.

“We demand you immediately halt all RIF actions and provide the committee with detailed information about the scope, timing and justification of these reductions,” they wrote, adding that they would like to see the department’s plan for implanting and overseeing programs managed by the offices targeted by the layoffs.

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Congressman Steven Horsford (D-Nev.-04), Senator Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Congresswoman Dina Titus (D-Nev.-01) and Congresswoman Susie Lee (D-Nev.-03) sent a letter to U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Doug Burgum raising concerns that the Department’s new policy is placing additional scrutiny on only certain renewable energy sources. This action could put the stability of the energy grid at risk and raise utility rates in states that rely on solar power, like Nevada.

“This July 15th memo establishes that ‘all decisions, actions, consultations, and other undertakings … related to wind and solar energy facilities shall require submission to the Office of the Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, subsequent review by the Office of the Deputy Secretary, and final review by the Office of the Secretary.’

“We are concerned this memo is meant to intentionally hinder the deployment of renewable energy projects on our public lands, and we question its necessity, especially considering this memo only applies to wind and solar energy facilities rather than all forms of energy production. We are also concerned that the impacts of this memo extend beyond federal lands to any private project that requires approvals at the federal level, such as for transmission right-of-way permits, thus placing even more projects potentially at risk of either being delayed or cancelled altogether,” wrote the members.

As DOI implements this new policy, residential electricity rates have spiked across the United States – more than 30 percent on average since 2020 and almost double the rate of inflation in the past year. At the same time President Trump ended or delayed 80,500 clean energy jobs, cancelled $24 billion for energy projects since May, and announced the termination of nearly $8 billion in clean energy investments in states that did not vote for Trump. Additional projects, including in Nevada, face increased uncertainty due to the Administration’s decisions.

“[B]y adding new permitting hurdles, the Department risks choking this progress and ceding global energy dominance to China, whose ‘all of the above’ strategy has allowed their economy to grow rapidly. By the end of 2024, China added 277 gigawatts of solar, 79 gigawatts of wind, and 40 gigawatts of energy storage compared to roughly 60 gigawatts total across all energy generation types in the United States,” continued the Members.

“The United States is facing an impending energy crisis. Electricity demand is rising rapidly, yet the energy grid is unprepared. DOI’s July 15th memo does not “unleash energy dominance;” it weaponizes the permitting process against it. If the Department is serious about an all-of-the-above energy strategy, it must ensure that both traditional and renewable energy resources can be developed efficiently and responsibly,” concluded the Members.

A public comment period on the proposed rollback ended last month, with EPA and the administration expected to decide soon.","The federal government has plans to roll back an Environmental Protection Agency policy that could affect numerous regulations. Central New York environmental and civic officials worry that impacts could be felt locally if the move goes through and conservation and health protections are lost.

The Endangerment Finding legally recognizes greenhouse gases as air pollutants posing dangers to public health. The ruling, adopted in 2009, is the legal underpinning for restrictions on tailpipe emissions, the smokestacks of power plants burning fossil fuels, and regulations for clean air and water to limit industrial pollutants.

We spoke with Central-Northern New York Chair of the Sierra Club Rhea Jezer, who said losing that authority would undermine progress toward new kinds of energy and climate resilience.

“Renewable energy will be decimated,” Jezer said. “All the incentives we’re getting to put our solar panels up, all the incentives we’re getting to get electric cars, that’ll be gone.”

Jezer, who runs Energy 21, a forum on renewable power, added the effects would extend far beyond energy policy. She worries that without federal regulation, public health in cities like Syracuse will worsen.

“The asthma rate, for instance, the city of Syracuse, it's appalling,” she said “If all this is put in place the way the administration wants to, we are going to have more disease. We're going to have more changes in cold and warm, less snow.”

Since 2009, the Endangerment Finding has served as the basis for federal efforts to help eliminate carbon emissions that threaten human health and the environment. The Trump administration argues the science behind the endangerment finding is outdated–and no longer supports have the E-P-A limit emissions from cars and power plants.

Syracuse City Auditor Alexander Marion said the EPA’s mission to protect communities is essential, decrying changes that would weaking it.

“The EPA's job is to keep us safe,” he said. “It is to ensure that children have clean drinking water, and our workers can go outside and have better air quality, it is their job to ensure that our communities are safe to exist in going forward.”

Still, Marion urged local residents are not powerless. He believes communities can push back through civic engagement and advocacy.

“The hope I have is in the people in Syracuse and communities across this country to step up, do the right thing, push their federal government, use the levers of democracy, including the levers in the voting machine, to ensure that we are enacting the policies that we need to safeguard our communities for the future.”

Marion added that higher greenhouse gas levels and resultant effects become a direct problem for the city

“When we are not taking the steps we need to mitigate the damage of climate change, that will cost us money, whether that’s worker’s compensation, infrastructure,” he said, “We are already outfitting our schools with better air condition units because our buildings are old and they are getting hot.”

Both Jezer and Marion say maintaining the Endangerment Finding is critical is critical to protecting not only Central New York’s air, water, and climate, but ensuring the whole country remains a safe and healthy place to live.

Fleet decarbonization in action: 3 steps to get started To get started on fleet decarbonization, consider the following practical steps and read on to see how real-world companies are putting them into action.
Tailor your strategy: Implement a fleet decarbonization strategy tailored to business circumstances, rather than deploying a common approach across the organization.
Lessons learned: Even if total fleet electrification is not viable, do not rule out other paths to fleet decarbonization.
Whether by reducing operational costs, guarding against energy price volatility, or enhancing brand reputation, operational emissions reductions can deliver broad business value.","Introduction: Why fleet decarbonization matters for sustainable business growth

As companies navigate a business landscape defined by continuing disruption and uncertainty, decarbonization’s dual value of climate mitigation and long-term enterprise and financial resilience ensures it remains a business imperative. Indeed, few other corporate actions can simultaneously cut costs, open new markets, increase access to finance, reduce regulatory exposure, and bolster energy security.

This second blog in our three-part series on operational decarbonization explores how companies can use tailored fleet management to reduce their emissions while also bolstering operational performance. As with our first blog on industrial heat, we highlight real-world case studies to bring fleet decarbonization to life and highlight its unique challenges and opportunities.

How to reduce fleet emissions and fuel costs with smart fleet management

Companies can drive significant reductions in both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel costs through a focus on vehicle fleets (e.g., route optimization, electric vehicle adoption, alternative fuels, etc.). While exact solutions will vary by organization and jurisdiction, companies can develop tailored, value adding fleet decarbonization approaches with the right expert diagnosis.

For companies with large vehicle fleets, addressing transportation emissions is crucial to meeting sustainability goals. Still, the task can appear daunting. High upfront capital costs, significant operational impacts, and policy uncertainty often challenge companies and can slow progress. In the U.S., for example, the recent sunsetting of federal tax credits for electric vehicles will likely complicate corporate fleet management strategies that involve alternative fuel vehicles, although fleet/route optimization strategies remain value accretive. By contrast, in Europe and elsewhere, total cost of ownership (capital cost plus long run operating costs) of electrifying passenger car and van fleet can deliver impressive ROI. In one ERM project example, a pan-European manufacturing firm saw a 2.7 year payback through shift from diesel vehicle ownership to electric vehicle leasing.

Many of ERM’s clients also have fleets that span vehicle types which serve different purposes. Their fleet situations are further complicated because their vehicles are distributed across geographies and are at different stages of their useful asset life. Faced with these complexities, businesses struggle to identify a starting point for addressing fleet emissions.

Businesses can cut through these challenges by developing a strong fleet decarbonization strategy that breaks a fleet into component parts and identifies solutions for each, rather than pursuing a single, fleet-wide solution. For example, public incentives and low electricity prices in a given operating region might make certain fleet segments—such as light-duty vans or refrigerated trailers—well-suited for electrification, driving rapid financial upside.

Conversely, electrification in other fleet segments may be challenged by capital limitations, leading businesses to turn to renewable fuels that do not require significant infrastructure investment to achieve emissions reductions. Here, a “yes, and” approach enables more practical, scalable progress than an “either, or” approach.

The case studies we outline below exemplify how businesses have successfully applied this philosophy to reduce their fleet emissions.

Fleet decarbonization in action: 3 steps to get started

To get started on fleet decarbonization, consider the following practical steps and read on to see how real-world companies are putting them into action.

Conduct a fleet assessment: Identify the most impactful and cost-effective decarbonization opportunities across the fleet.

Tailor your strategy: Implement a fleet decarbonization strategy tailored to business circumstances, rather than deploying a common approach across the organization.

Build a phased roadmap: Do not try to do everything all at once. Build a practical, phased roadmap for fleet decarbonization that enables steady progress.

Case study one

Challenge:

A U.S.-based HVAC company’s fleet, comprised of passenger vans and trucks with significant towing requirements, represented more than 90 percent of the firm’s total GHG emissions.

The company aimed to achieve fleet cost savings and simultaneous emissions reductions, all while avoiding significant operational changes.

The solution:

ERM’s financial and emissions modeling showed that while transitioning the entire company’s fleet to EVs would drive the largest GHG emissions reductions, such a transition would be cost-prohibitive. Instead, ERM identified vans as the fleet segment where emissions reductions would be most cost-effective.

ERM proposed a pilot tailored to a subset of vehicle types, targeting vans in the U.S. state of Massachusetts (where the business had a higher concentration of vans and owned property to facilitate charger installation, thus reducing costs). After success in Massachusetts, the company expanded the pilot across the U.S.

In addition to the pilot, ERM leveraged creative financing options to lower fleet transition costs. By leasing electric vans rather than owning them outright, the company could save money and limit capital outlay, while still reducing GHG emissions.

The impact:

This strategy identified levers to realize a 34 percent reduction in emissions intensity and $2.2 million in annual operational savings due to lower operations and maintenance costs and fuel spending. Furthermore, by switching to leased vans, the company could avoid capital expenditures of $80,000 or more per new van purchased.

Lessons learned:

Rather than waiting for the entire fleet to be electrification-ready, focus on the segments where you can make immediate progress. This incremental approach reflects the “yes, and” philosophy in action—electrify where it works now and explore other solutions across your fleet as you go.

Location matters. Conduct a pilot for the fleet in a location with favorable conditions (e.g., concentration of particular vehicle types, strong EV infrastructure, etc.) and then apply lessons learned to other locations with similar characteristics.

Consider leasing options for the fleet in addition to outright capital purchases of EVs and other low carbon vehicle types.

Case study two

Challenge:

A U.S.-based wholesale distributor aimed to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by more than 25 percent. Although its fleet represented nearly three-quarters of these emissions, total electrification was not feasible because long-haul trucks composed a majority of its fleet and cost-effective low carbon alternatives were not yet available.

The solution:

ERM’s financial analysis showed that switching to renewable diesel would enable the company to reduce emissions without the significant capital costs associated with electrification.

ERM also compiled a portfolio of producers that could supply renewable diesel and determined geographies where supportive regulatory frameworks would make the fuel cost-competitive with fossil diesel.

ERM then recommended a tiered transition plan, where the company would first switch to renewable diesel in U.S. states where it achieved cost parity with fossil diesel, before expanding to more nascent markets.

The impact:

By switching to renewable diesel, the company was able to reduce its emissions by 13 percent and cost competitively with fossil diesel, putting it on track to achieve its Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction goal.

Further, the renewable diesel solution offered 40 percent cost savings compared to electrifying the company’s entire fleet.

Lessons learned:

Even if total fleet electrification is not viable, do not rule out other paths to fleet decarbonization. By remaining flexible and adopting solutions aligned to specific contexts, businesses can achieve significant GHG emissions reductions.

Public incentives can make a material difference to the economics of fleet decarbonization.

Breaking fleets into segmented parts and applying bespoke solutions can help unlock faster decarbonization and overcome complexities that might otherwise slow progress.

Case study three

Challenge:

A European waste services provider based in Europe with an extensive refuse collection and street cleaning fleet set out to establish reduction targets for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The company had to navigate fleet decarbonization across demanding duty cycles, short (8-10 years) contract lengths with its customers (primarily municipalities), and customer-imposed budget caps that limited the company’s ability to absorb capital cost uplift.

While an early adopter of electric refuse collection vehicles in some jurisdictions, its wider fleet was diverse with distinct operational requirements for different use cases.

The solution:

ERM conducted a detailed duty cycle analysis that found that off-the-shelf battery electric models would be suitable for some of the client’s operations; however, transitioning its most demanding operations would depend on future technology advancements.

ERM’s financial modelling showed that vehicles accounting for 17 percent of the company’s emissions could be immediately transitioned cost-effectively, while others would become cost-effective in the 2030s as upfront vehicle costs decreased.

ERM recommended a gradual fleet electrification program that would require upfront investment but would begin generating net returns for the company beginning inthe early 2030s.

To ensure the company maintained net income during its transition, ERM calculated the level at which contract prices for customers would need to increase and explored several levers for improving the business case for electrification, including longer contract lengths and shared charging infrastructure.

The impact:

By transitioning the fleet gradually instead of all at once, the company will be able to abate 50-70 percent of emissions by 2035 compared to an all diesel fleet.

Lessons learned:

By accounting for diverse fleet operations, companies can develop tailored electrification plans that prioritize cost-effective solutions for the portions of their fleets that can be transitioned immediately, while also accounting for future actions that will enable them to transition their remaining vehicle types as technologies develop.

By viewing fleet electrification as a single investment, rather than a processes with multiple starts and stops for different vehicle types, companies can more rapidly and comprehensively deploy innovative business models to support decarbonization.

Innovative contracting approaches allow fleet operators to transition their vehicles while also helping their customers overcome economic barriers.

Conclusion: Fleet decarbonization as a strategic imperative

Decarbonization is a clear strategic imperative for companies looking to improve operational resilience and financial performance. Whether by reducing operational costs, guarding against energy price volatility, or enhancing brand reputation, operational emissions reductions can deliver broad business value.

Using lessons learned from the case studies above, companies with large vehicle fleets can turn decarbonization from ambition to actuality, reaping benefits along the way.

The U.S. Department of Energy approved a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for American Electric Power (AEP) to modernize 5,000 miles of high-voltage power lines. The upgrades will cross Oklahoma, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia.

This project will strengthen regional reliability and reduce outages linked to severe weather. For Oklahoma, the investment supports grid resilience and clean energy integration. The lines will connect existing oil-and-gas-powered generation with renewable energy transmission corridors.

Energy analysts say the move positions Oklahoma to handle expanding power demand from data centers, electric vehicle charging, and manufacturing growth.

The project also supports Oklahoma’s growing role as a regional transmission hub, linking renewable generation in western Oklahoma with industrial and urban demand centers near Tulsa and Oklahoma City for improved reliability statewide.

Texas Orphan Wells Highlight Broader Market Stress

Meanwhile, Texas regulators report a troubling increase in orphaned oil and gas wells, now surpassing 10,000 sites. Industry observers warn the number could grow as oil prices fall and small operators abandon unprofitable wells.

The surge raises environmental concerns, including methane leaks and groundwater contamination. It also threatens energy-sector employment in rural regions tied to Oklahoma’s southern border.

According to a statement issued by the new coalition, Carbon Measures will leverage sound science and the principles of financial accounting to help enable a ledger-based carbon accounting framework to address issues with current systems including accuracy, double counting, and information gaps, with the new framework aimed at helping companies to differentiate their products and to allow governments to make more informed policy decisions.

While focusing on the new carbon accounting framework, the coalition said that it will also prioritize designing carbon intensity standards for key industrial products that form the basis of most supply chains, such as electricity, fuel, steel, concrete and chemicals.

Ana Botín, Executive Chair of Banco Santander, said:

“This initiative aims to create a reliable, globally comparable way to calculate carbon intensity comprehensively across each step of the value chain, enabling product standards and accelerating the transition as a result. By joining forces to create a market-driven solution to this critical challenge we are laying the groundwork for real, scalable impact, building on our ongoing efforts to reduce emissions.”

General Motors’ electric moonshot of the late 1990s has become a legend, solidifying itself as the first modern EV for the masses, despite just a handful being leased to owners—several of whom were celebrities—before they were taken back by the company and mostly crushed.

The EV1’s tale is a fascinating one, with tons of data out there about how the car came to be, and all of the interesting ways engineers made it happen. I highly recommend reading David Tracy’s write-up on the EV1 factory service manuals he picked up last year, or our exclusive story on how there was nearly an EV1 convertible.

With just 137 horsepower from a single electric motor, 26 lead-acid batteries, and around 90 miles of range, the EV1 wasn’t exactly mind-blowing by modern EV standards. But it was vastly ahead of its time. This was a viable battery-powered car that hit the market over 10 years before the Tesla Roadster, after all. GM was way ahead of the game and in a position to set itself up for success in the decades to come.

Of course, everyone knows what happened next. Low demand and high costs forced GM to cancel the EV1 program, despite owners voicing their praise for the car. GM collected every example and crushed them, aside from around 40 cars, which were donated to museums and universities. It would be another decade until GM introduced another electric car to the market, the Spark EV, in 2013.

With the electric car market as big and important as it is now, President Mark Reuss, understandably, wishes GM weren’t so quick to lower the EV1 to its grave. When asked about what he’d change with hindsight in an interview with InsideEVs, he brings up the revolutionary EV almost immediately:

I wasn’t around for EV1; I wasn’t in the company. But I think that might have been one example of something that we, the company, should not have done, which was canceling that; that was really quite a car.

The EV1 was a game-changer for a lot of reasons. It introduced stuff like low-rolling-resistance tires, regenerative braking, HVAC heat pumps, and keyless ignition. Gen-two cars got nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, which doubled range, while third-generation cars got even longer-range lithium-polymer batteries. It also had a drag coefficient of just 0.19, beating out modern equivalents like the Lucid Air and the Mercedes-Benz EQS. While most other manufacturers hadn’t even figured out EVs, GM was already hundreds of steps ahead. Who knows just how far ahead the company would be now in the EV space had it stuck with developing the car further.

While Reuss believes the EV1 was a stopping point, others at the company believed it was a stepping stone. Gary Witzenburg, GM’s EV program Vehicle Test and Development manager during the EV1’s development, said as much in 2021 in a retelling of the car’s chaotic history, which he wrote for Hagerty:

The momentum the EV1 program generated led to fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) research; Allison hybrid buses; plus “two-mode” hybrid technology for trucks, SUVs, and two generations of extended-range electric (EREV) Chevrolet Volts. (Successful and satisfying as the Volts were, they were too costly to be profitable.) Now GM touts the battery-electric (BEV) Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV, with many more electric vehicles to come.

Witzenburg believed it was limited battery tech that held GM back from building the EV1’s successor in the early 2000s, rather than cost or demand. Whether you agree with him or not, Reuss seems to have learned from the past, going by the rest of that InsideEVs interview:

I think the strategy that we set a few years ago to grow our company with electric vehicles and ICE vehicles, and being able to manufacture some of those in the same place, like Spring Hill, Tennessee, and have cell plants in the United States located in the places we do. You can talk about adoption rate, you can talk about where we are today. But all I know is the adoption rate isn’t as quick as what we thought it was going to be.

The tax credit goes away, what’s going to happen? We’re going to see what happens. But I can tell you that a high percentage of people with buying a electric vehicle, for instance, buy another one. Yeah. So that’s a really good flywheel to be on, and a good trend that’s long term. And while the rate may fluctuate year to year in terms of how many, it’s permanent and it’s real. And I don’t I don’t see ever not being a big part of the U.S. auto industry.

So, despite the notion that EV sales will soon dip in America due to tariff costs and a lack of federal tax credits, don’t expect GM to give up on the tech any time soon.

U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico averaged 7.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in May 2025, the most of any month on record as Mexico’s demand for natural gas, particularly in the electric power sector, increases. On an annual basis, U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico averaged 6.4 Bcf/d in 2024, a 25% increase compared with 2019 and the highest on record in data going back as early as 1975.

Total consumption of natural gas in Mexico increased from 7.7 Bcf/d to 8.6 Bcf/d during the same time period, with most growth concentrated in Mexico’s electric power sector.

Natural gas exports from the United States enter Mexico along four main corridors—South Texas, West Texas, Arizona, and California—with a combined capacity of about 14.8 Bcf/d and an approximate utilization rate of 43% in 2024. Several factors limit U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico, including:

Constraints in Mexico's pipeline infrastructure, including new pipeline construction and permitting delays

Limited natural gas storage capacity in Mexico

In 2024, pipeline exports from West and South Texas collectively accounted for 91% of U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico. The South Texas corridor connects from the Agua Dulce Hub into northeastern Mexico. Natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas primarily serves northwestern, central, and southwestern Mexico through various natural gas systems in Mexico. Exports from West Texas increased from 0.6 Bcf/d in 2019 to 1.8 Bcf/d in 2024. The increase of U.S. imports was facilitated by the commissioning of additional connecting pipelines in central and southwestern Mexico in recent years.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration; Mexico Ministry of Energy, Hydrocarbon Map

Mexico plans to continue to expand its domestic pipeline network to meet potential growth in demand. Natural gas imported from the South Texas corridor through the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline has access to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, power plants, and other uses of demand, and the pipeline connects with the Gasoducto Puerta al Sureste (Southeast Gateway Gas pipeline), an offshore pipeline completed in 2025 and designed to supply natural gas to new power plants in the Yucatan Peninsula. In 2022, sections of the Tula–Villa de Reyes and Tuxpan–Tula pipelines commenced partial operation, with full service anticipated in 2025. The Energia Mayakan pipeline is expected to expand natural gas infrastructure on the Yucatán Peninsula by 2025. Developers of the Centauro del Norte pipeline, which will provide additional pipeline capacity to northwestern Mexico's combined-cycle power plants, began construction in 2025.

LNG was first exported from Mexico in August 2024 from the Fast LNG Altamira Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) 1. Two additional LNG export projects, Fast LNG Altamira FLNG 2 and Energía Costa Azul, are currently under construction with a combined capacity of 0.6 Bcf/d, drawing supply from U.S. natural gas imports.

Corning Fiber Optic Production Grows In Catawba County, NC

In the western part of the state, Corning Optical Communications LLC, a division of Corning Incorporated, will acquire a lot in Trivium Corporate Center to expand in Hickory in Catawba County. The company is growing its manufacturing operations there with plans to hire and maintain a minimum of 132 jobs at an average salary to exceed $65,000/year.

“With this capacity expansion, Corning is addressing demand from leading network operators — in particular AT&T, which previously announced plans to significantly expand its fiber footprint,” said Michael A. Bell, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Corning Optical Communications. “We believe the industry is in the early stages of a major growth cycle, and we’re turning once again to the highly skilled local workforce in Catawba County to help us meet the demand. We deeply appreciate the support of local and state officials, particularly Governor Roy Cooper, Commerce Secretary Machelle Baker Sanders, and state lawmakers.”

Corning’s Optical Communications business operates cable facilities throughout the state of North Carolina, including Hickory, Newton, and Winston-Salem, and optical fiber facilities in Wilmington and Concord. Its Optical Communications headquarters is in Charlotte.

Corning’s project will be facilitated by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee. Using a formula that takes into account the tax revenues generated by the new jobs, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $2,041,200, spread over 12 years.

Corning’s JDIG agreement could also move as much as $226,800 into a fund that helps rural communities across the state attract business in the future. When companies select a site located in a Tier 2 county such as Catawba, their grant agreements move some of the new tax revenue into the state’s Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account.

“And so while it is cost-effective in some cases to shift data center demand to renewables, sometimes this shifting of demand instead recruits more stable base-load fossil plants.

If coordinated properly, flexibility can encourage the use of and investment in renewables, cutting emissions while offering significant savings to the operators of data centers.
But without that coordination, we risk locking in more fossil generation instead of moving toward greener infrastructure.” Read the paper: Flexible data centers and the grid: lower costs, higher emissions?","What you’ll learn:

Data center flexibility — the ability to shift workloads to different times of day when renewable energy generation is high or prices are low — is one way to address rising energy consumption. A new study finds that flexibility always reduces costs. But the environmental effects depend on the local grid, with flexibility sometimes even increasing emissions.

Data centers in the U.S. consumed about 4.4% of all domestic electricity in 2023. The Department of Energy expects this number to rise to between 7% and 12% by 2030.

Much of this growth in data center electricity demand is being driven by artificial intelligence and cloud computing, according to a professor of applied economics at MIT Sloan. “These technologies are transformative, but they also put enormous stress on the grid,” he said. “That raises big questions about how we manage demand and whether our power systems can keep pace in ways that are both reliable and sustainable.”

With Juan Senga and Shen Wang, postdoctoral associates at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Knittel analyzed how operational flexibility within data centers affects costs and emissions. They found that the flexibility to shift workload to different times of day when renewable energy generation is high or prices are low always reduces costs. The environmental effects, however, depend on the generational mix of the local grid, with flexibility sometimes even increasing emissions.

Flexibility cuts costs but not necessarily emissions

The researchers ran a model that compared three regional energy grids — the Texas grid, the mid-Atlantic grid, and the Western Interconnection — which together are projected to manage more than 80% of data center demand by 2030. They measured the economic and environmental effects of two factors: how far a center can shift workload within a 24-hour period, and what fraction of work can be shifted.

They found that flexible workloads universally create cost savings compared with grids that don’t support flexible workloads, with reductions ranging from about 2% in the Western Interconnection to 5% on the Texas grid. Cost savings can rise as the share of work that is flexible increases, though the approach has diminishing returns.

“At the start, it’s very easy to shift loads to times that have the cheapest energy generation, so there’s a lot of money on the table,” Senga said. “But as you use up those initial, cheap options, it gets harder to squeeze out benefits.”

On the environmental side, flexibility can lead to investment in renewable infrastructure: When demand shifts to times of day when renewables are active, the value of that infrastructure increases. Specifically, the researchers showed that flexibility can spur solar investment in the mid-Atlantic and the Western Interconnection while pushing wind investment in Texas. (These differences hinge on the relative abundance of wind and sun in each region.)

Yet flexibility does not always generate emissions reductions. In Texas, where wind and solar constitute roughly half of the grid’s projected energy mix, the researchers found that flexible workloads led to emissions reductions of up to 40%. In the other two regions, where coal and gas make up a greater share of the grid, flexible operations led to an increase in emissions of up to 3%.

“This happens because our model is optimizing for costs — meaning the number of investments that are made and how expensive it is to operate different types of generators, be it renewables, natural gas plants, coal plants, nuclear plants, you name it,” Senga said. “And so while it is cost-effective in some cases to shift data center demand to renewables, sometimes this shifting of demand instead recruits more stable base-load fossil plants. This just depends on the underlying economics of renewable and fossil generation.”

Incorporate flexibility from Day 1

This research implies that companies in the business of building data centers should design for flexibility from the outset, since it’s a guaranteed path to savings.

Some types of work are inherently more flexible than others — training AI models can be shifted around more readily than fielding AI queries, for instance. For that reason, flexible data center design may entail a concerted balancing of processes across data centers to maximize flexibility in each location by looking at the type of work that it does.

For companies that are also pursuing emissions reduction goals, flexibility is essential but insufficient on its own. The mix of regional electricity-generation sources and their underlying economics will ultimately determine whether flexibility generates environmental benefits.

“We don’t have a hard number, but in our simulated numerical results, we needed about 50% renewable penetration to see these lower emissions,” Wang said. “If you’re below that, then fossil generation is the dominant system and emissions may increase, even with more flexibility.”

With data centers projected to consume a growing percentage of electricity in coming years, companies and states may benefit from working together to manage demand, the researchers write. If coordinated properly, flexibility can encourage the use of and investment in renewables, cutting emissions while offering significant savings to the operators of data centers. But this result won’t unfold on its own.

“The lesson here is that flexibility has to be built into data center operations from the start, and it has to be paired with strong policy support for clean energy,” Knittel said. “If companies and policymakers work together, flexibility can reduce costs and also accelerate investment in renewables. But without that coordination, we risk locking in more fossil generation instead of moving toward greener infrastructure.”

New Jersey electric bills rose up to 20% this summer

Experts say PJM must act to modernize the state’s aging power grid

Data centers, EVs and clean energy goals are increasing electricity demand

Investing in new transmission lines could lower costs and boost reliability

This summer, many of us in New Jersey were stunned when we opened our electric bills and saw a huge increase. Starting June 1, the average monthly bill rose between 17% and 20%, depending on where you live in the state. That’s on top of the fact that New Jersey’s electricity rates are already about 20% higher than the national average.

When we sweat through these lingering heatwaves, we shouldn’t also have to sweat about our wallets.

There’s a clear reason for this price spike: our aging electric grid is struggling to keep up with today’s needs — let alone tomorrow’s demands.

If we want to stabilize prices, make sure the lights stay on, and meet our clean energy goals, we need to build a modern energy grid that can handle it all.

We’re still relying on an electric transmission system that was largely built more than 60 years ago. This aging infrastructure – which moves power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed – can only be patched and upgraded so much. While tools like Advanced Transmission Technologies and Grid-Enhancing Technologies can help squeeze more capacity out of existing lines, they are not a substitute for building new transmission infrastructure. To truly make a difference, we need new transmission built sooner rather than later.

That starts with PJM, the regional grid operator responsible for planning and managing the high-voltage transmission system across 13 states, including New Jersey.

A call to rise to the moment

PJM has significant authority over how electricity gets from where it’s generated to where it’s used in our homes, businesses, and critical facilities. But while other grid operators – such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator in the Midwest – are engaging in long-term, proactive planning that evaluates system-wide benefits, PJM continues to lag.

That delay has real consequences: it leaves our region more vulnerable to reliability issues and price spikes. We need PJM to rise to the moment.

That means robustly complying with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s new Order No. 1920, which directs regional grid operators to plan for the long-term needs of the electric system. It also means planning not just for today’s electricity needs, but for the wave of new power demand that is already arriving.

A troubling picture

Just look at the numbers. Data centers already consume 5% of New Jersey’s total electricity — a figure that’s expected to more than double by 2030. Hearings conducted by the state’s Legislative Oversight Committee earlier this year revealed that artificial intelligence data centers are placing unsustainable strain on our aging grid.

These facilities are enormously energy intensive. Add in the coming surge of electric vehicles, home and building electrification, and onshore manufacturing, the demand forecast paints a troubling picture: without action, we’re facing a future power crisis.

Investing in transmission doesn’t just improve reliability and support clean energy — it also saves money.

New Jersey also has some of the most ambitious clean energy goals in the country: 100% clean energy by 2035 and 11,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040. Meeting these goals will require a grid that is capable of moving large amounts of clean power from where it’s generated – often far offshore or in more remote areas – to population centers. That won’t happen on its own.

Investing in transmission doesn’t just improve reliability and support clean energy — it also saves money. A recent report found that for every $1 invested in new transmission lines, customers like you and me receive between $3.80 and $4.70 in benefits.

Now’s the time to plan for the future

PJM is in a position of enormous influence. The choices its leadership makes in the months and years ahead will shape our electric system and our electricity bills for decades. If PJM doesn’t plan for the future now, New Jerseyans will pay the price.

That means cutting through red tape to speed up permitting and making bold investments in new transmission lines. New Jerseyans deserve lower energy bills, fewer blackouts, and a stronger foundation for clean energy and innovation. If we act now, we can protect customers, power our communities, and build a grid for everyone.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/10/Electric-Transformer.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 18:18:43.861463

The panel brought together leaders from across sectors, including Adonai Herrera-Martínez (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), Jiang Hao (China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute), Gauri Singh (International Renewable Energy Agency), Karen Westley (Ipieca), and keynote speaker Marco Lambertini (Nature Positive Initiative) and host Rachel Asante-Owusu, Senior Programme Coordinator for Energy Transition at IUCN.

Defining a Nature Positive Energy Transition

Panelists converged on a shared ambition: expanding renewable energy without eroding ecosystems or marginalising communities. For keynote speaker Marco Lambertini, “nature positive” means going beyond reducing harm—it means actively regenerating biodiversity. “Nature positive,” he said, “is about pursuing economic development that results in more nature, not less. It’s more ambitious than net zero, because nature can regenerate faster than the climate can recover.”

The conversation underscored how this ambition is being translated into measurable targets under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, adopted by 196 countries. Applying a stepwise mitigation hierarchy is central to this approach: renewable energy projects must avoid sensitive ecosystems and threatened species wherever possible, mitigate unavoidable impacts through careful planning, and restore and compensate where damage occurs to ensure net gains for biodiversity.

From Ambition to Action: Indicators, Policy, and Finance

Speakers stressed the urgent need for credible, practical indicators to track nature positive outcomes — similar to existing greenhouse gas protocols for climate. This would give governments, developers, and investors the clarity needed to align projects with biodiversity targets.

A major focus was on bridging policy and finance. “Aligning finance for biodiversity is more complex than for climate,” noted Adonai Herrera-Martínez. “We need clear guidance, blended finance, and safeguards to make nature positive projects financially viable.”

Panelists highlighted transmission infrastructure as a critical bottleneck: while solar and wind investments are increasing, underinvestment in smart grids could slow the transition.

People at the Centre

Cross-sector collaboration and stakeholder engagement emerged as key themes. Jiang Hao shared a hydropower case in China where community input and scientific research led to halting a project to protect rare species. “Without listening to communities,” he noted, “the energy transition cannot be sustainable.”

Karen Westley showcased Shell’s efforts to integrate biodiversity into operations — from methane reductions to Indigenous-led restoration projects — highlighting how corporate actors can be part of the solution.

Speakers also addressed regional disparities: projects in Africa face longer timelines and higher costs due to regulatory hurdles, while ministries of environment often remain side-lined. Participants called for breaking down silos between energy, environment, and finance ministries to improve coordination and reduce costs.

Dialogue, Innovation, and Enabling Environments

The conversation underscored the need to mainstream nature positive narratives in energy policy and project planning. This requires ongoing dialogue between governments, investors, communities, and technical experts — through platforms, forums, and assemblies.

Innovation — including AI and advanced monitoring technologies — was identified as a key enabler for better biodiversity measurement, while policy levers like procurement and traceability can help create market demand for nature positive solutions.

As Gauri Singh concluded: “The energy transition is the most important transformation humanity is living through today. We must make sure it doesn’t come at the expense of biodiversity and resilience.”

Next Steps: From Dialogue to Delivery

The session concluded with a strong call for collective action. Participants underscored the need to develop and launch clear guidance for the investment community on integrating biodiversity into renewable energy development, expected in 2026. Strengthened cross-sector policy dialogues will be crucial to bridge gaps between ministries and agencies, while global platforms will continue to share lessons and best practices to accelerate progress.",https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/nature-positive-renewables.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 13:01:20.078453

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.
It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the 176-member state UN agency responsible for developing global standards for shipping, announced that its member states have voted to delay the adoption of the “IMO Net-Zero Framework,” a global agreement aimed at implementing measures to reduce the climate impact of ocean shipping.

The establishment of the international net zero shipping framework was delayed despite an initial draft receiving majority support in April, following significant pressure from the U.S.’ Trump administration, which had threatened a series of retaliatory actions against nations supporting the agreement.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.

Under the framework, ships would be required to comply with a new global fuel standard to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time, with ships above the GFI thresholds required to balance their emissions deficit by transferring “surplus units” earned by other ships or used surplus units they may have already banked, or to purchase remedial units.

Proceeds from the sale of remedial units would contribute to an IMO Net-Zero Fund, rewarding low-emission ships, supporting innovation, research, infrastructure and just transition initiatives in developing countries, funding technology transfer and capacity building to support the IMO GHG Strategy, and mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable states.

The April framework was approved by 63 nations in April, while the U.S. publicly opposed the agreement and left the negotiations prior to the vote, following which the administration warned of “reciprocal measures” to compensate for any fees under the new framework charged to U.S. ships, and “for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures.”

Prior to the beginning of negotiations to adopt the framework last week, the U.S. State Department issued a communication stating that “the Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,” and detailing a series of actions that it would consider on nations supporting the framework, including “considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries,” imposing visa restrictions on crews, imposing commercial penalties and additional port fees, and “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers,” among other potential measures.

A motion to delay the negotiations on the framework by a year put forward by Singapore and tabled for a vote by Saudi Arabia was agreed to by 57 countries, and opposed by 49, with 21 abstaining.

Industry participants expressed disappointment with the delay, citing the uncertainty it will create in their emissions reduction initiatives and investments. In a statement following the announcement, shipping giant Maersk called the decision “a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” and that it now must “await further clarity on the road ahead and on how the IMO intends to continue the work on the Net Zero Framework.”

Maersk added:

“The energy transition of the shipping industry has never been an easy task. It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more. Global regulations are a precondition to securing a level playing field in a global industry.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMO-Oct-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:10:36.672036

Sales in China, once a money-printing region for VW Group, have collapsed due to heightened competition from domestic models.
One of the more interesting bits Manager Magazin reports involves the launch plan for VW’s newest brand, Scout Motors.","I’m a pretty big fan of Volkswagen’s products, so whenever I hear about the company not doing well, it makes me sad. These days, I feel like this has been happening a lot.

According to a new report from German publication Manager Magazin, VW is in fairly dire straits financially right now. Net cash flow—or, how much money is left after taking away all costs—is reportedly falling to dangerously low levels, which is leading the company to make some tough cost-cutting decisions.

Those decisions lie with Arno Antlitz, VW Group’s chief financial officer. Manager Magazin reports that he’s assembled the CFOs from the conglomerate’s biggest brands to figure out how to turn things around. From the article:

CFO David Powels (63) was present for VW, Jürgen Rittersberger (53) for Audi, and Jochen Breckner (48) for Porsche. The group, not a popular topic within the company, was designated the “Net Cash Flow” Task Force.

Antlitz’s mission for the high-profile group caused unrest: According to those involved, the CFO demanded €12 billion in additional cash flow, and specifically for 2026. “This magnitude, so quickly; that’s never happened before,” commented one top executive. It’s a massive cost-cutting shock.

Things are looking even worse this year. Sales in China, once a money-printing region for VW Group, have collapsed due to heightened competition from domestic models. Going by deliveries, Audi is down nearly 5% globally through he first three quarters. Porsche, meanwhile, is down 6%. Even the company’s historically market-proof brands, Bentley and Lamborghini, are down slightly year-over-year. The VW brand itself, as well as Euro-centric brands Skoda, SEAT, and Cupra, are up slightly this year.

It’s not just China. The North American market isn’t helping either. Spiking prices due to tariffs and the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit mean sales are waning, with deliveries for the group down nearly 8% in the region this year so far. The result of all this, according to Manager Magazin, will be stuff like more platform-sharing:

For example, the next Audi A6 and the second generation of the Porsche Taycan could be based on a common architecture. Despite the models’ quite different profiles (a conventional premium sedan and a sports car), this would reduce costs.

One of the more interesting bits Manager Magazin reports involves the launch plan for VW’s newest brand, Scout Motors. The revived American nameplate that relaunched in 2022 plans to introduce an electric SUV and truck by 2027. Last year, the company revealed it would also offer its vehicles with a range extender option, which quickly became the most popular drivetrain amongst those placing pre-orders. Going by this article, it sounds like VW is smartly prioritizing those buyers:

[A]ccording to information from manager magazin, the Scout electric truck, intended as a promising prospect for North America, will initially only be available with a combustion engine as a range extender – and not as a purely battery-electric vehicle.

Scout declined to confirm to me whether this is its plan, but considering the state of the EV pickup truck market in the US right now, it makes the most sense. Even the most popular pure BEV trucks occupy a tiny niche of the market, so building the battery-powered Scouts first wouldn’t have moved the needle.

The range-extended Scouts, meanwhile, are a far more promising proposition. They pair a 60-to-70 kWh battery pack to a naturally aspirated four-cylinder mounted under the bed, just in front of the rear axle, there just to keep the battery charged. With a fully charged pack and a full tank of gas, Scout promises around 500 miles of range. Importantly, these range-extended Scouts can also tow long distances without drivers having to stress about topping off the battery at a charging station, something that a lot of buyers seem to care about, whether they’re actually towing stuff frequently or not.",https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Scout-Terra_Gas_TS.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:06:35.109867

Across the session, a clear consensus emerged: achieving global restoration goals requires shared learning, inclusive participation, and innovative approaches to policy, finance, and implementation.","The event, held in the IUCN Programme Pavilion, brought together a diverse group of speakers offering unique perspectives on restoration across scales. The session discussed topics ranging from the Target 2 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to financial mechanisms and instruments for restoration, to social equity and rights-based approaches to restoration. Ultimately, the session recognised existing restoration successes while also highlighting remaining challenges and barriers faced by communities, as well as solutions for overcoming them. Speakers emphasized that ecosystem degradation and deforestation, driven by unsustainable human activity, continue to undermine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and adaptive capacity in the face of intensifying climate change. Restoration, they agreed, must be at the centre of solutions; linking environmental integrity, social inclusion, and economic opportunity.

Ecosystem degradation is a global threat affecting all habitat types. Current estimates indicate that 20% – 40% of the world’s land is degraded, harming the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion people. In recognition of these challenges, several global restoration goals have been established. Target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) aims to ensure that 30% of the total area of degraded terrestrial, inland water, and marine and coastal ecosystems is under effective restoration by 2030.

Similarly, the Bonn Challenge aims to bring under restoration 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. Furthermore, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, lasting from 2021 through 2030, is a global movement aiming to support and scale up global restoration efforts while raising awareness of the importance of multi-scale restoration. Together, these rallying calls are driving global progress on restoration—but challenges and barriers remain.

Raising and Sustaining Ambition at the National Level

The session began with high-level remarks from H.E. Hambardzum Matevosyan, Minister of Environment of Armenia, where he discussed Armenia’s role as Presidency of the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP17) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), set to take place in 2026. The Minister laid out Armenia’s commitment to advancing biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration and supporting the aims of the CBD under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF), including Target 2. The Minister highlighted Armenia’s integrated approach to restoration as a cornerstone of its climate and sustainable development strategies, underscoring new afforestation and reforestation programs, improved forest data transparency, and stronger links between protection and restoration. The Minister’s intervention came just after the announcement of Armenia joining IUCN as a new State Member, concurrently highlighting Armenia’s commitment to raising ambition for nature.

Mr. Oliver Conz, Director General at Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUKN) followed with a keynote address, discussing Germany’s history of commitment to supporting restoration efforts globally. Mr. Conz reaffirmed Germany’s continued leadership and partnership through the Bonn Challenge, combining financial, technical, and policy support for restoration worldwide. “The Bonn Challenge promotes forest landscapes restoration as a key contribution to deliver on the 2030 goals of the Rio Conventions and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Bonn Challenge promotes synergies between climate protection and biodiversity conservation translating commitments into concrete action,” said Mr. Conz.

Leveraging Finance and Conventions to Amplify Impact

The session then transitioned to a panel where a diverse set of decisionmakers and stakeholders convened to share their unique perspectives on ecosystem restoration and progress towards global restoration goals, with institutional leaders and international partners expanding on the enabling conditions for large-scale restoration. Finance and inclusion emerged as recurring themes in need of urgent attention.

Valerie Hickey, Global Director, Climate Change Group at the World Bank began by setting the stage for discussion on financial mechanisms and instruments which can be leveraged to support restoration efforts across scales. Ms. Hickey noted that de-risking investment and addressing systemic barriers such as insecure land tenure, especially for women, are essential to unlocking private capital for restoration. Without finance being unlocked and directed to communities to support restoration and reward nature-positive practices, she emphasised, restoration goals cannot be met.

“Ecosystem restoration is key to the reversal of biodiversity loss – and central to achieving Target 2 and indeed the entirety of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,” said Olivier Rukundo, Senior Programme Management Officer, Head of Peoples and Biodiversity Unit at the CBD Secretariat, underscoring the need to move beyond pledges and accelerate practical implementation toward the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’s Target 2. “To accelerate action on ecosystem restoration, in particular strengthening Parties to report on the headline indicator for Target 2, the CBD Secretariat, FAO and other partners have launched a global capacity-development programme, the ‘Target 2 Roadmap.’”

“For restoration efforts to be successful, we need to start with the people who live in the area in question. Gender equality and social inclusion are essential. This means recognizing and honouring the unique strengths, needs and challenges of women and men, jointly removing barriers to participation and ensuring that everyone can contribute their skills and knowledge and have their voice heard,” said Chantal Felder, Head of Section Climate, Disaster Risk Reduction and Environment, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Ms. Felder further emphasised the importance of local ownership, participatory processes, and gender equality, arguing that sustainable restoration begins with people and must deliver long-term benefits for communities.

“The restoration economy has the potential to bring jobs, economic development, health, social, biodiversity, climate and ecosystem services dividends in real ways. It bridges sectoral siloes and offers smart investment choices, but only if we get out of the conservation bubble for meaningful partnerships,” said Doreen Lynn Robinson, Deputy Director, Ecosystem Division at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), stressing that restoration must be embedded at the heart of development policy, aligning with economic and social frameworks to unlock the 'restoration economy' and its potential for equity, gender, and employment dividends.

Government, Civil Society, and Community Perspectives Intersect at the Heart of Restoration

Scientific, technical perspectives were also elevated. “To achieve restoration at scale, we must bridge science and practice. Evidence from landscapes around the world shows that restoration succeeds when local knowledge, strong data, economics and inclusive policies come together. Collaboration across disciplines and sectors is essential if we are to restore ecosystems that sustain both people and the planet,” said Dr. Robert Nasi, Director General, CIFOR and Director of Science, CIFOR-ICRAF, highlighting the need to apply behavioural and social sciences to better understand the drivers of degradation and make scientific knowledge actionable at local levels.

Several panellists stressed, however, that restoration goals cannot be achieved without integrating social equity concerns and gender-responsive approaches, nor without including smallholders and local community members who act as land stewards but who often are overlooked. “True restoration is not only of lands, waters and ecosystems,” said Mrinalini Rai, Director, Women4Biodiversity. “It is also the restoration of rights, recognition, and resources to women who sustain them. Financing gender-responsive, community-led restoration is not charity—it is an investment in resilience, justice, and the planet’s future.”

“Indigenous Peoples have restored their territories for generations and continue to do so. The objective of restoration should not be to respond to donors but more importantly to restore balance between man and nature,” said Minnie Degawan, Managing Director, FSC Indigenous Foundation (FSC-IF), underlining that Indigenous Peoples, women, and local communities are not only beneficiaries but essential knowledge-holders whose perspectives must guide planning, decision-making, and implementation.

Pedro de Castro Cunha e Menezes, Director of Protected Areas at the Ministry of Environment of Brazil and Raúl Jiménez Rosenberg, Executive Secretary of El Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO) of Mexico offered additional country perspectives, laying out successes from their countries as well as challenges they are working to overcome. Both Mr. Castro and Mr. Jimenez explained how restoration is being embedded in their countries’ national policies, from identifying priority sites and integrating restoration into planning frameworks to promoting research, innovation, and nature-based tourism through initiatives such as long-distance ecological trails. They then expanded on how other countries can learn from their experiences with ecosystem restoration, and they underscored why national and regional ambition are essential to achieving global goals.

The session ended with a virtual intervention from Richard Verbisky, Senior Advisor at Natural Resources Canada and Head of the International Model Forest Network (IMFN) Secretariat. IMFN is a voluntary global community of practice whose members and supporters work toward the sustainable management of forest‐based landscapes and natural resources through the Model Forest approach. Mr. Verbisky highlighted how partnership networks like IMFN can bridge the gap between the many dimensions outlined by other speakers—connecting local communities to global resources and enabling them to support progress towards national, regional, and global targets, while also ensuring restoration is locally-relevant and conscientious of equity and rights concerns. Mr. Verbisky’s full intervention is available to view below.

Hanoi plans to ban fossil-fuel motorcycles from its city center in July 2026, part of a national drive to cut emissions and air pollution. Its commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, is weighing a similar step. By 2030, Vietnam aims for a third of cars and more than a fifth of motorbikes to run on electricity.

Some see this as an opportunity to swap out smoke-belching engines for cleaner, quieter rides, But others remain wary. Gas-powered bikes are still cheaper, sturdier, and easier to repair. Many owners worry that electric models could fall short on range, affordability, and charging convenience.

At the heart of the debate is the motorbike’s central place in Vietnamese life. The country’s 77 million two-wheelers — including 7 million in Hanoi and 8.5 million in Ho Chi Minh City — power small businesses, shape daily commerce, and set the rhythm of cities. Shopkeepers pile goods onto scooters to push through traffic, while families squeeze three generations onto a single bike for the school run.

While delivery drivers and mechanics are scrambling, electric bike start ups are opening new retail stores and e-bike sales are climbing.

Vietnam’s biggest motorbike makers, Honda and Yamaha, say the 2026 timeline is too ambitious. Vietnamese electric vehicle companies — startups like Dat Bike or the larger VinFast, backed by Vietnam’s largest conglomerate VinGroup — and the Chinese electric bikemaker Yadea are betting on an electric future.

Ta Manh Cuong, 45, a ride-hailing driver who earns about $20 on good days, calls his battered but reliable motorbike his “iron horse,” a slang riders use for their faithful companion through the city’s daily chaos. He'd be willing to shift to an electric bike, would even welcome it if it cost less.

“But right now I can’t afford to buy an electric bike,” he said.

Vietnam’s motorbike market, at about 3.5 million units a year, is the second-largest in Southeast Asia. It's also among the most electrified markets for two-wheelers, ranking third only to China and India, though electric motorbikes make up about 12% of total sales.

Electrifying remaining two-wheelers is key for cutting tailpipe emissions and clearing smog from the streets. EVs are more energy efficient than gas engines, said Zifei Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation. About 70,000 deaths in Vietnam each year are linked to polluted air, according to the Boston-based nonprofit Health Effects Institute.

Unlike the car market, Yang added, motorbikes sold in Vietnam are made there. That means a shift to electric bikes could boost local producers, foster startups, and attract new investment. Vietnam’s transition could also shape other developing markets.

“These countries look at each other. Look at the experience,” she said.

Electric motorbike sales have surged since the ban was announced, with purchases of smaller bikes up 89% and full-sized bikes 197% in the first eight months of 2025. VinFast led as its sales more than quadrupled, outpacing Yadea and other local rivals, according to industry tracker MotorcyclesData.

Yang said government subsidies to scrap old motorbikes could help riders like Cuong. While better public transport in crowded city centers would also encourage the shift to electric vehicles. She added that ride-hailing fleets stand to gain too since they travel longer distances and electric bikes could help them save on fuel. Stations where riders can replace depleted batteries with a fully charged one instead of waiting for it to recharge would also help.

Yang said smaller batteries make home charging easier, battery costs are falling globally, and EVs are no more fire-prone than older vehicles, though such fires need special training and strict safety standards.

Ho Chi Minh City plans to replace 400,000 gasoline motorbikes with electric ones by 2028, starting with a 2026 ban on using gas bikes for ride-hailing and delivery. The city will offer low-interest loans, tax breaks and set up low-emission zones to curb pollution. In Hanoi, people affected by the ban can get $120 to $200 in subsidies to buy electric bikes worth at least $590, depending on income, and won’t have to pay new registration or license plate fees until 2030.

VinFast looks set to profit from the transition. Its ride-hailing company, Green SM, surpassed Singapore-based regional ride-hailing firm Grab in February to become the market leader in Vietnam. It soon will launch its first battery‑swapping electric motorbike, selling for about $760. It plans, also, to build 150,000 battery-swapping stations nationwide within three years.

VinFast is partnering with Vietnamese banks to offer low‑interest loans and subsidies to boost electric vehicle adoption, including covering up to 90% of costs and waiving registration fees.

These policies and incentives can encourage more purchases of electric motorbikes, said Dat Bike CEO and founder Son Nguyen, but long-term success hinges on making electric bikes that deliver high performance, long ranges and fast charging at prices equal to or better than gas-guzzling motorbikes. “Incentives can help add momentum, but long-term success depends on building products that win on their own merits,” he said.

Dat Bike raised $22 million in September from private investors, nearly doubling its capital to $47 million. The company said it will use the funding to boost production, research and expand its sales.

Honda dominates Vietnam’s motorcycle market with a more than 80% market share. It sold about 2.3 million bikes in Vietnam from April 2024 to March 2025 and exported 300,000 more, cementing the country as both a top market and a key production hub.

Yamaha trails with about a 17% share. Through Vietnam’s manufacturers’ association, the two companies said the 2026 ban is too rushed. Honda only began selling e-bikes this year and warned that replacing millions of bikes quickly would strain consumers.

Honda and the Vietnam's motorcycle manufacturers' association didn't respond to requests for comment. Yamaha told The Associated Press that it was reviewing the plan and couldn't respond yet.

For now, many businesses are hedging their bets. Bao Ngoc Cao, who rents motorbikes to expats and tourists, said she was “terrified” when she first heard about the ban. Her business runs on the principle that bikes are cheap — costing about $80 monthly. Losing access to Hanoi’s most touristy streets would cut her off from her core customers, and while interest in EVs is growing, current subsidies aren’t nearly enough for her to replace her fleet. Still, she says she supports the ban in principle, welcoming the promise of cleaner air and healthier streets.

“We are just waiting to get more clarity and see what happens,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/20/PDTN/86800524007-ap-25291606448912.jpg?crop=4999,2812,x0,y260&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-20 12:11:50.344258

Regulation is fast becoming the choke point not just for growth in energy use, but for growth in productive intelligence.","Artificial intelligence doesn’t run on optimism or buzzwords. It runs on electricity. This seems to be a growing concern as the technology advances, with outlets from Teen Vogue and Wired to the Washington Post and Harvard Business Review publishing articles about AI’s alarming energy and water consumption. The previous AI doomerism now seems to be focused less on AI’s application and more on its use of resources. However, there should be a case for optimism on both energy policy and technology policy regarding this issue.

Rather than immediately rushing to fit these growing energy demands into our existing policy frameworks, AI can provide an opportunity to rethink our static models and mental frameworks around energy. Such rethinking provides opportunities for dynamic growth in both technological innovation and energy. If the United States wants to lead the world in AI, policymakers must abandon the illusion that a centrally planned grid can power a decentralized technological revolution. Energy abundance and technological progress thrive when they are built on the same foundation: an open-ended market process with less government intervention.

Understanding AI’s Energy Demands and Society’s Accompanying Panic

AI is already reshaping electricity demand in ways the traditional system wasn’t designed to handle. After two decades of essentially no growth in electricity demand, US data centers could consume 6.7 to 12 percent of America’s electricity in just three years, up from 4.4 percent today. McKinsey estimates this surge will add about 460 terawatt-hours of demand between 2023 and 2030—roughly tripling current levels of electricity consumption by data centers. The scale and speed of data center growth highlight a fundamental mismatch: AI-driven demand is accelerating far faster than the legacy grid can accommodate.

But AI’s energy demands are far more complicated and part of a long-standing tradition of concerns about energy depletion in the face of new technologies. A 1999 Forbes headline, for example, discussed the need to “dig more coal, the PCs are coming” and noted the “electric load of a small village” the large servers needed. The original industrial revolution was met with The Coal Paradox and fears that the world’s coal supply would be exhausted.

But what actually happened in all of these cases? We found new sources of energy and improved our efficiency in the use of existing resources to power our growing and changing needs.

AI’s energy use is also more complicated than it may seem. For example, some of the significant elements of AI, like training a model, are one-time costs. In other cases, there are questions about what the alternative energy consumption would have been, such as doing repeated searches or longer processes that would also draw on energy resources. And as Daniel Castro’s report on the models that have predicted the demands and concerns of AI’s energy use shows, there is at least some reason to believe the current numbers might be inflated.

What AI Needs from the Energy Sector

Energy policy will be a needed element of our AI infrastructure if we want to continue to see this technology grow and flourish in many beneficial ways. The rapid pace of innovation means the AI revolution won’t wait for multi-year permitting fights, cost-of-service hearings held by regulators, or planning processes built for the analog era. And yet those are the structures that still govern electricity in much of the country.

Building a new transmission line in the US now takes about 10 years, while generation projects spend multiple years stuck in interconnection queues, with more than 2,600 gigawatts of capacity now in queues nationwide. America is trying to power a permission-less innovation boom in AI with an agonizingly slow, permission-first utility regime, and the results are predictably bad.

Market participants are already trying to solve the mismatch. Major firms are seeking direct power purchase agreements with independent generators, building behind-the-meter capacity, exploring private microgrids, and even considering small-scale nuclear partnerships when the technology matures. These efforts aren’t futurist gambits—they are attempts to work around today’s regulatory regime, which assumes electricity is something the government must gatekeep rather than something people can freely build and buy.

But unfortunately, many of these ideas can run up against existing regulatory barriers or significant requirements. (Ironically, in some cases, AI would be able to help with these requirements, such as reviewing environmental impact analysis or other paperwork steps to allow new solutions.) For policymakers who want to support unleashing American energy and innovation, the AI moment may provide a perfect opportunity for reform.

Tangible Policy Reforms

State policymakers have shown how simple reform can be. In August, New Hampshire enacted a one-page law that exempts off-grid electricity providers from public utility regulation. The logic is straightforward: if you’re not using or impacting the legacy grid, you shouldn’t have to ask legacy regulators for permission. We call this policy Consumer Regulated Electricity, or CRE. Similar reforms have already moved forward in Ohio, Utah, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

That makes room for industrial-scale networks, development that is consumer-driven rather than regulator-approved, and tailored contracts between energy producers and large customers. Responsibility for any cost overruns stays with the parties involved, rather than being socialized across captive ratepayers.

It is an open question whether a new federal law could enact CRE nationwide in one fell swoop, but there are immediate steps federal policymakers could take to embrace the same hands-off approach. As one example, if a new industrial network is not connected to the existing bulk power system, grid reliability watchdogs at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation should exempt it from the stringent rules that apply to the broader synchronized grid. This could be done by FERC through a rulemaking or by Congress through a simple definitional change in section 215 of the Federal Power Act.

Unlike burdensome top-down regulation focused on AI’s application, reforming energy policy can provide a way for policymakers at all levels to provide an infrastructure that could power AI innovation without dictating its applications or limits.

Why It Matters

In addition to practical policy issues, there is a philosophical debate beneath the surface. Progress does not come from central planning. It comes from exploration, the process of trial and error, and dynamic adaptation to changing circumstances. In a recent issue of Free Society, Johan Norberg argued that abundance tends to arise from unplanned, bottom-up problem-solving—not from central blueprints.

This year’s Nobel Prize in economics underscores the importance of innovation, knowledge systems, and openness to disruption. The laureates demonstrated how growth and long-run prosperity emerge when markets allow talent, ideas, and capital to move freely. Their research confirms what experience has already shown: we don’t get growth from planned economies. We get it by allowing discovery and competition, by embracing the open-ended market process. Regulations that restrict entry or stifle entrepreneurs may create stability in the short run, but they suffocate progress in the long run.

Energy and AI are no exceptions. In too many parts of the country, electricity policy is still built around forecasting demand, rationing supply, and approving projects through multi-year regulatory battles. AI and the industries emerging around it are growing quickly through trial and error, experimentation, and iteration. These worldviews were bound to collide. The notable exception is in the state of Texas, where the electricity system is dynamic and seems uniquely capable of accommodating the massive demand growth from data centers. But even the grid in Texas falls under heavy regulation and could benefit from Texas lawmakers adopting a true free-market approach like CRE.

Policymakers often claim they are acting out of caution when they slow or block new technology, but history tells a different story. The greatest risks come not from moving too quickly, but from freezing existing systems in place and assuming yesterday’s institutions can meet tomorrow’s needs. Overly cautious policies don’t signal a system preparing for the future; they signal that policymakers are afraid of it. Today’s obstructionism comes from local pushback on data centers and federal permitting regimes that stretch project timelines to a decade or more. Regulation is fast becoming the choke point not just for growth in energy use, but for growth in productive intelligence.

Conclusion

History shows that our fears of new technologies leading us to run out of energy are nothing new. Instead of further miring us in the status quo, AI could disrupt the way we approach energy policy. The ideas discussed above would allow policymakers to embrace the ways a free market can help meet AI’s electricity needs and unlock the broader economic transformation it represents.

In the sclerotic electricity sector, smart reform means a radical return to the American idea by legalizing alternatives to monopoly control, clearing government obstacles, and allowing price signals to guide investment. Intelligent power will not come from a permission-first system run by bureaucrats—it will come from the open-ended market process that runs on free enterprise and entrepreneurship.

“I am relieved that the Judge upheld our concerns with Commonwealth LNG, and that LDENR failed the people of Cameron Parish.
My hat is off to the local district court for this unbiased decision to hopefully protect the citizens and save a piece of God’s country in Cameron Parish.”","A wave of planned U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects is perceived to be under scrutiny in the aftermath of a recent court ruling, which revoked a permit for an LNG export terminal over alleged climate harms. This decision is anticipated to halt the project’s construction activities on the west bank of the Calcasieu Ship Channel at the mouth of the Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico) near Cameron Parish in Louisiana, United States.

Based on the court’s findings, the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) violated the Louisiana Constitution by issuing the coastal use permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG export facility without considering its disproportionate effect on the surrounding communities of color and low-income communities, alongside the climate change and cumulative impacts, with other export facilities in the area.

Eric Huber, Managing Attorney at Sierra Club, commented: “We are heartened by the court’s ruling that LDENR’s refusal to consider the environmental justice impacts of the project violated the Louisiana Constitution. It is past time for LDENR to account for the true costs of its permits on Louisiana’s coastline and communities in terms of loss of wetlands and storm buffers.

“This is another in a series of permits by LDNR for the LNG build-out on the Gulf, including the permit for CP2 directly across Calcasieu Pass. We urge LDENR to stop its pro-forma permitting and carry out its mission to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans.”

With this in mind, a Louisiana state court vacated the coastal use permit for the proposed export project, highlighting that state officials failed to consider the environmental implications of the development. Commonwealth LNG, which is controlled by the energy-focused alternative investment manager Kimmeridge, has secured multiple LNG offtake deals, including the most recent one with EQT.

James Hiatt, Director of For a Better Bayou, said: “This ruling is a victory for the people and the wetlands of Southwest Louisiana. It shows that when our government fails to protect our coast from reckless industrial expansion, the courts can still uphold the law.

“For too long, communities like ours have carried the burden of pollution, flooding, and destruction while corporations profit. This decision is a reminder that our coast is not a sacrifice zone—it’s our home, and it deserves protection.”

Climate change campaigners believe that Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects.

Joanie Steinhaus, Ocean Program Director for Turtle Island Restoration Network, emphasized: “This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities. These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment.”

This is not Commonwealth LNG’s first brush with the law, as a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorization for the same project in July 2024, ruling that FERC failed to adequately assess the cumulative and direct environmental and health impacts that would be caused by air pollution from the facility.

The decision caused FERC to revise its air pollution analysis and give the project the go-ahead to begin site preparation for construction. However, the Cameron Parish court’s decision has now revoked the state coastal use permit, which is anticipated to stop the project’s construction unless and until a new permit is issued in compliance with the Louisiana Constitution.

Anne Rolfes, Director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade, underlined: “Like the rest of the gas export industry, Commonwealth would be a polluting disaster that would destroy fragile fishing areas and further decimate fishing families in southwest Louisiana. It should never have been permitted. We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses.

“On one side are out of state profiteers who export our natural resources and pollute us in the process. On the other are Louisiana families who want to be able to live here and catch and eat our seafood. Commonwealth would destroy our coast and our culture. It would make us more vulnerable to storms. The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

Sierra Club claims that the liquefied methane gas, known as LNG, which the project would export, would have annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 14 coal-fired power plants or 13 million new gasoline-powered vehicles.

With six LNG export terminals proposed, approved, under construction, or operating in the area, including Venture Global’s Calcesieu Pass and CP2 facilities, energy analysts believe that there is a risk the latest court ruling could impact other LNG development and expansion projects.

According to Sierra Club, these facilities contribute to the loss of hundreds of acres of wetland and habitat for sensitive species, increased flooding, loss of buffer areas from storms, air and water pollution, and increased risks of catastrophic industrial accidents.

John Allaire, Resident of Cameron Parish, stated: “As a long-term landowner in Cameron Parish who lives adjacent to the Commonwealth LNG site and one mile from Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG, I see the effects of LNG export terminals every day— the frequent flaring, the noise and light pollution, and destruction of our wetlands and fisheries. It’s a massive burden and destroying our community.

“Not just a data center, it could be any economic development project that we're talking to, that still is our No.
The company’s leaders have said they want to both protect existing customers and attract data centers to the region.
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a letter to Ameren CEO Lyons on Wednesday demanding information about utility bill increases and data center costs.","The director of the Missouri Department of Economic Development flipped through a slideshow at an October meeting about the future of power in the state. She landed on a slide showing large business projects the department is trying to attract to Missouri.

“I think this is the money slide, right?” said Michelle Hataway.

The slide displayed 10 data centers that the office is courting. Their peak electric demands were huge, reaching as high as 2,000MW, which is almost the entire output of Ameren Missouri’s largest power plant, the Labadie coal plant in Franklin County. In 2024, the largest single Ameren customer had a peak demand of 32MW.

“If you would have told me, whenever I became director of the department, that for an entire year I would be going around talking about power and the importance of power, I would have rolled my eyes and told you you're crazy, right?” Hataway said. “But that is where we are as a state.”

As large data centers consider moving to Missouri, they are asking for unprecedented amounts of energy. At the October summit, state policymakers and business leaders discussed how they would meet the demand.

Gov. Mike Kehoe urged the attendees to figure it out, saying energy is the most important factor for growing Missouri’s economy.

“Not just a data center, it could be any economic development project that we're talking to, that still is our No. 1 question, ‘What can you do for me for reliable base load power?’” Kehoe said. “And so I implore upon you to help us move that ball down the field.”

But with the data center-driven push for more electricity, experts say there is a real risk that regular people will see their electric bills skyrocket because the decades-long precedent for how monopoly utilities make money wasn’t built for customers that are potentially 60 times larger than the current biggest energy consumer on a system.

Incentives to build

The data center boom is particularly enticing for monopoly utility companies because they make money by building things, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School and co-author of the paper “Extracting Profits from the Public: How Utility Ratepayers Are Paying for Big Tech’s Power.”

“Utilities have a peculiar business model where their profits are tied to how much money they spend on physical infrastructure,” Peskoe said. “So the more power lines and power plants they build, the more profitable they are.”

A single data center can use as much power as a large city, which Peskoe said means utilities will need to build a lot of new, expensive infrastructure.

On top of that, Peskoe said investor-owned utilities like Ameren Missouri have an incentive to tell shareholders they are going to be building soon, and thus bringing in more profits.

“Ameren is a for-profit company,” Peskoe said. “It has a stock that trades on a stock exchange, and some of the information that it puts out is designed for investors and potential investors.”

In its Aug. 1 call with investors, Ameren said that it had a “robust data center pipeline” and that its sales growth in the coming years would be primarily driven by increased data center demand.

Ameren said it had about 2,300MW of signed construction agreements with data centers, and previous public filings by the company said those agreements represented five projects. The company’s CEO, Marty Lyons, also said these prospective customers have already paid Ameren millions of dollars.

“These developers have demonstrated their confidence in and commitment to their potential projects by submitting nonrefundable payments totaling $28 million towards the cost of necessary transmission upgrades,” Lyons said.

The company would need to quickly accelerate the building of power plants for new customers, Lyons said.

Along with a business model that incentivizes construction, utility companies like Ameren also typically spread the cost of building power plants and other infrastructure out among all customers through rate increases, Peskoe said.

“So in effect, utility profits go up, and everybody's bills go up as well,” Peskoe said.

Risk of overbuilding

Peskoe also said a huge risk is that utilities will build power plants for data centers that don’t move to their areas.

“There's a possibility that we're in a bubble right now, and if the utilities do build out a lot of new infrastructure, and the data centers never show up or they use less power, the utilities may very well go to regulators and say, ‘We want everyone else to pay for this infrastructure that we thought was going to be paid at least in part by the data centers,’” Peskoe said.

As these companies shop for a location, they are talking to multiple utilities in various states, which presents the risk that the projects are being double-counted in energy planning. The Sierra Club found more than 700GW of data center claims from U.S. utilities, which would represent more energy than the entire country produced in 2024.

At the October energy summit, multiple speakers said Missouri is competing with other states to win data center contracts. During a question and answer session, Hataway, the director of economic development, was asked if this might represent a bubble that would burst.

“Honestly, everything is cyclical, right?” Hataway said. “So I'm not going to sit here and tell you guys that there's not going to be potentially a boom with regards to data centers, right, and the bubble burst, right?”

But she said the size of investment from the companies signaled long-term commitments.

“I would ask, do we want to take advantage of the opportunity as it's happening?” Hataway said. “I'm not saying we have to take advantage of 100 data centers that are looking at Missouri, but do we be extremely picky?”

Protecting other customers

One way to keep regular people from paying for data center infrastructure is by designing special rates, called tariffs, for the huge customers, Peskoe said. There is a movement to do that across the country.

Missouri’s legislature passed a law this year that requires utilities to write tariffs for customers demanding 100MW or more of energy.

“That's a good step to kind of isolate these data centers from everybody else,” Peskoe said. “But the devil really is in the details.”

Ameren has written its proposal for these rates and submitted it to the Public Service Commission, which regulates monopoly utilities in Missouri. The company’s leaders have said they want to both protect existing customers and attract data centers to the region.

“We're going to do everything that we possibly can to reasonably ensure that these customers are paying their fair share, and that we're not unjustly passing costs on to other customers,” Rob Dixon, Ameren’s senior director for economic, community and business development, told St. Louis Public Radio in August.

At the October energy summit in Missouri, Ameren’s senior vice president who oversees data center customers, Ajay Arora, said the company is focused on making sure everyone is paying a representative share and the most vulnerable customers are protected from data center costs.

“We just have to make sure that we allocate capital in the most optimal manner to find the exact places which have the most value to customers,” Arora said. “And that's what we do, while also ensuring that we're negotiating hard, we're planning the supply chain, we're ensuring we're keeping costs low for customers, but most importantly, that we are keeping the operating and maintaining costs as low as possible.”

On the August earnings call, Ameren CEO Lyons also said the construction of data centers and more energy infrastructure will benefit everyone by creating jobs and tax revenue that support the local economy.

“To realize this opportunity, we must also offer attractive rates,” Lyons said.

In the initial proposal for data center tariffs, Ameren laid out a base rate of $0.06 per kWh, which is similar to the bulk rate other industrial customers currently pay. Residential customers pay $0.16 per kWh in the summer.

Ameren’s proposal for data center customers also includes terms to try to isolate costs and prevent overbuilding, like a minimum 15 years of service, exit terms and fees, a minimum energy use of 70% of what the data center asked for, and credit or collateral requirements.

While Peskoe said these tariffs are common sense, nailing down rates is always a contested process that is ultimately up to Missouri’s Public Service Commission.

“There's a lot of calculations that are going to go into determining what the rate structure ought to be,” Peskoe said. “And this is not a physics problem that ultimately has a single right answer.”

And Peskoe said it will be difficult to know the actual amount data centers might add to regular people’s bills.

“There's a long history in this industry of hiding a lot of information from the public about the utilities future plans and about how it computes its rates, and it's going to be challenging to figure out exactly how much costs these facilities are adding to rate payer bills,” Peskoe said.

In September, Missouri Public Service Commission staff called on the body to reject Ameren’s data center proposal. They calculated that a single 100MW data center would raise the bills of existing Ameren customers by about $22 million every year until the data center’s new load was accounted for in a rate case. An Ameren spokesperson said the company disagrees with the staff’s position.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a letter to Ameren CEO Lyons on Wednesday demanding information about utility bill increases and data center costs.

“Missourians deserve affordable and reliable electricity,” Hawley wrote. “They should not be forced to subsidize corporate projects while struggling to keep their lights on.”

Ameren expects a decision about its data center rates from the Public Service Commission by February.

The plan also extends the Energy Skills Passport scheme, facilitating transitions from offshore oil and gas into new areas such as offshore wind, nuclear and electricity networks.
“Clean energy is not only about technology but about purpose —renewing the skills and infrastructure that have served us for decades to power the next chapter,” said Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica.
The Clean Energy Jobs Plan thus stands as the social pillar of the UK’s energy strategy.
As Miliband concluded, “The clean energy mission is not only about energy security —it’s about good jobs and a nation renewed from the ground up.”","The United Kingdom has taken a decisive step in its energy transition with the launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan —a roadmap that, for the first time, sets concrete targets for developing green employment and the technical skills needed to sustain the sector’s growth. Backed by record levels of public and private investment in renewable and nuclear energy, the plan foresees a doubling of clean energy-related jobs over the next five years, reaching 860,000 by 2030, with strong demand for 31 priority occupations, including electricians, welders, technicians and plumbers.

Presenting the plan, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stressed that “communities have long been calling for a new generation of good industrial jobs” and that “the clean energy boom can answer that call.” He added: “Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean power, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands will have access to well-paid, secure jobs without having to leave their hometowns.”

The strategy sets out a coordinated investment effort between government, industry and education providers to train the next generation of clean energy workers. It will establish five new Technical Excellence Colleges and pilot programmes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire with £2.5 million in funding to expand training and career guidance. Specific initiatives will also target veterans, ex-offenders and unemployed people, recognising that at least 13,700 Britons currently out of work already possess skills relevant to the energy sector.

A key component involves the retraining of oil and gas workers, who will benefit from up to £20 million in joint funding from the UK and Scottish Governments. The plan also extends the Energy Skills Passport scheme, facilitating transitions from offshore oil and gas into new areas such as offshore wind, nuclear and electricity networks.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the plan “will give workers the skills needed for the switch to clean energy – good for them, good for industry, and good for growth across the nation.”

The document also introduces binding labour standards to ensure that the expansion of renewable energy creates high-quality, secure employment. Employment protections currently enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers —including the national minimum wage— will be extended to the entire clean energy sector, while a Fair Work Charter will be signed between offshore wind developers and trade unions to guarantee decent pay and robust workplace rights. The Government also acknowledged the need to strengthen union representation —which has fallen from 70 per cent in the 1990s to around 30 per cent today— describing trade unions as “essential to ensuring good pay and fair conditions.”

Since July 2024, the Government estimates that its clean energy mission has mobilised more than £50 billion in private investment, supporting projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which will create 10,000 construction jobs; the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor programme, expected to support 3,000 jobs; and the Acorn and Viking projects in Scotland and the North East, set to add 35,000 jobs including 1,000 apprenticeships. An additional 4,000 positions will arise from new carbon capture and storage (CCUS) projects in the North West and Teesside.

The salary impact is equally significant: entry-level roles in the clean energy sector pay around 23 per cent more than comparable positions in other industries, while jobs in wind, nuclear and electricity networks offer average annual salaries of £50,000, compared with the UK average of £37,000.

The plan’s publication was welcomed by leading companies —including Centrica, ScottishPower, EDF, Siemens Energy, E.ON, Uniper, National Grid, Renewable UK and Energy UK— which agreed that the strategy provides the regulatory certainty needed to invest in talent, innovation and industrial expansion. “Clean energy is not only about technology but about purpose —renewing the skills and infrastructure that have served us for decades to power the next chapter,” said Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica. Keith Anderson, CEO of ScottishPower, added: “With clear direction, we are creating thousands of well-paid jobs in the communities we serve.”

Major trade unions —TUC, Unite, GMB, UNISON, Prospect and Community— also endorsed the plan, highlighting its inclusion of fair-work principles and collective bargaining rights as foundations for a just transition. “This plan puts workers at the heart of our energy system and proves that when government, unions and employees collaborate, the whole country benefits,” said Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC.

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan thus stands as the social pillar of the UK’s energy strategy. Beyond megawatts and technology, it seeks to consolidate a transition that creates genuine opportunities for economic and regional development, particularly in coastal and post-industrial areas. As Miliband concluded, “The clean energy mission is not only about energy security —it’s about good jobs and a nation renewed from the ground up.”",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Default-Social-Share-Image-v2.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:18.720891

The utility giant, currently valued at $59.6 billion, has demonstrated strong momentum with a 30.4% return over the past six months and has maintained dividend payments for 28 consecutive years.

The upgrade follows Sempra’s September announcement regarding its SIP Sale, which Barclays views as marking the company’s transition toward focused U.S. utility growth. The firm expects Sempra to target 95% utility earnings contribution starting in 2027. According to InvestingPro, three analysts have recently revised their earnings upward for the upcoming period, supporting this positive outlook.

Barclays cited recent stock underperformance as creating an attractive entry point for investors to gain exposure to the Oncor asset, which has 14-15% RAB growth. The investment bank projects that Texas will represent approximately 60% of Sempra’s asset base by the end of the decade.

The firm’s EPS estimates for 2026-2028 are ""well-north of consensus,"" putting Sempra above the high end of its 7-9% EPS outlook and back within its prior 6-8% range by 2027, based on 2024 estimated earnings of $4.75.

At a 15.5x P/E ratio, representing a 10% discount to large cap electric and gas utilities, Barclays considers Sempra shares undervalued given the company’s EPS trajectory, high rate base growth, no expected equity issuance in the next few years, and increased earnings mix toward higher multiple, lower risk Texas assets. This analysis aligns with InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment, which suggests the stock is currently trading near its fair value.

Launching the West Midlands Major Investments Prospectus the Mayor presented more than £19bn of opportunities to drive new growth, jobs and homes across the region.

And he invited investors to share in the region’s future success with exciting opportunities across infrastructure, regeneration, and world-leading sectors.

The Prospectus showcases some of the region’s biggest projects including the £4bn Sports Quarter with its new Birmingham City FC stadium, the Sandwell – Dudley Metro Corridor and the region’s three key Investment Zone sites in Coventry & Warwick, Wolverhampton and Birmingham.

The Prospectus builds on the Mayor’s Growth Plan, a blueprint for how the region will grow its economy by £17 billion over the next decade, creating 100,000 new jobs and 120,000 new homes.

Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands, said: “Our region is brimming with talent: We have brilliant people, globally renowned businesses and world-class universities. Yet there is so much more potential waiting to be released.

“This Prospectus shows the sheer scale of what’s happening across our region, offering investors the opportunity to be at the forefront of driving a new era of growth, good jobs and affordable homes – the things that really matter to people.

“We have a proud history of innovation and industry but now is the time to go further and faster than ever before. Now is the time to invest in the West Midlands.”

Several Birmingham schemes set out in the prospectus will benefit from a new Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC), the biggest and most ambitious of its kind in the UK.

They include the Sports Quarter, the £4 billion Birmingham Knowledge Quarter, the HS2 station at Curzon Street, the £1.9 billion Smithfield development, and a major creative industries hub in Digbeth - all part of the Birmingham and North Solihull Gateway Project.

The MDC will give investors speed, scale and certainty, helping to deliver major schemes more quickly by bringing together planning powers, land, funding and delivery under one roof, cutting bureaucracy.

The Prospectus will play a key role for the region when the Mayor joins Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Secretary of State for Business and Trade Peter Kyle, in co-hosting the Regional Investment Summit in Birmingham tomorrow (Tuesday October 21).

The Summit will give the West Midlands and other regions the chance to showcase to global investors their potential for growth, innovation, and talent.

The West Midlands has seen a wave of inward investment over recent years and is now home to the country’s largest advanced manufacturing base and fastest-growing tech sector outside London. It also boasts world-leading clusters in clean energy, health tech and professional services.

Leading economist Bridget Rosewell CBE, who has been appointed by the Mayor to provide independent advice on aligning the region’s capital investments with his Growth Plan, said: “The West Midlands is a modern economic powerhouse with world leading sectors and an ambition and capacity to match.

“The Mayor’s Growth Plan provides us with a clear route to sustained growth. By bringing together transport, commercial development and housing in an aligned approach we can create dynamic new places, strengthen communities and give investors clarity on what’s coming, where and when.

“This is about crowding in private sector investment, sequencing schemes intelligently and moving from plan to spades in the ground with speed and confidence.”

The Prospectus showcases regional strengths and highlights investment opportunities underpinned by more than £2.4bn of new transport infrastructure to provide fast, reliable connections across the region.

On October 9, 2025, the U.S. Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2026 (Senate NDAA). The NDAA is annual legislation that authorizes policies and authorities for Department of Defense (DOD) programs and activities, military construction, and national security programs of the Department of Energy (DOE). While the NDAA focuses mostly on defense-related activities, this can include policy impacting the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), critical mineral supply chains, and nuclear energy. The House passed its version last month. The conference process between the Senate and House armed services committees will now kick off.

Below are some of the notable provisions in the roughly $914 billion defense legislation impacting environmental and natural resource policies, most of which are not included in the House version.

NEPA

Section 311 of the Senate NDAA requires the DOD to overhaul its existing guidance for implementing NEPA. Within 120 days of the bill's enactment, the Secretary of Defense must rescind all current NEPA-related directives and issue a new, unified directive applicable across all military departments and DOD agencies.

This new directive must ensure full compliance with NEPA, including updated procedural requirements established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. Additionally, within 90 days, the Secretary must appoint a responsible official to oversee the implementation of the directive and ensure environmental reviews are conducted promptly, avoiding unnecessary regulatory delays. This section clarifies that it does not change or override any part of NEPA itself. However, it is important to note that the Trump Administration is in the process of its NEPA overhaul, managed through the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), so provisions in the final NDAA could instruct or be guided by the CEQ effort.

PFAS

The PFAS-related sections of the Senate NDAA outline several significant policy changes and new requirements for how the DOD addresses contamination from PFAS.

PFAS Disposal and Procurement Restrictions

Section 315 grants the DOD authority to destroy or dispose of PFAS using ""innovative technologies"" that are also ""cost effective"" and approved by relevant federal or state agencies. The DOD must also update its existing PFAS disposal guidance to align with this approach.

In Section 316, the law updates a previous restriction on buying firefighter protective gear containing intentionally added PFAS, now allowing such purchases if the equipment meets the safety specifications of Standard 1970 from the National Fire Protection Association, rather than banning PFAS-containing gear outright. Section 318 repeals prior prohibitions on DOD procurement of certain PFAS-containing products (cookware, cooking utensils, furniture, carpets, and rugs containing perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)).

Community Support

Section 317 (which is included in the House version as Section 314) mandates that the DOD continues providing bottled water to communities with private wells contaminated by PFAS due to military activities—so long as contamination exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) limits and bottled water was already being supplied prior to the bill's passage. This requirement ends only if households are connected to municipal water systems or the contamination has been remediated to meet federal and state standards.

Cleanup Measures and Reporting Requirements

Section 319 repeals the moratorium on incinerating PFAS and aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), potentially allowing the resumption of incineration under approved methods. While Section 320 expands the DOD's responsibilities to address both actual and potential PFAS contamination. It requires preliminary site assessments at all ""covered facilities""—especially those with fire training pits. These assessments must consider interim responses to reduce public exposure, including bottled water, public water connections, and filtration systems. The DOD must expedite these measures, particularly in areas relying on a single drinking water source, and share assessments with the EPA, states, tribal governments, and the public for a minimum 60-day review period. Follow-up reports to Congress are required to track progress and justifications for any inaction.

Long-Term Transparency

Section 333 (which is included in the House version as Section 320) introduces a new annual reporting requirement to Congress detailing funding, site-by-site status updates, and progress on PFAS interim remedial actions across military installations. The reports must break down project phases, delays, and barriers, and provide site-specific timelines and remediation strategies. Additionally, within 180 days, the DOD must submit a PFAS remediation acceleration strategy with prioritization criteria, cleanup timelines, lab testing capabilities, and department performance benchmarks. To ensure public transparency, a regularly updated online dashboard must be launched within a year, providing real-time data on site cleanups, budgets, and community contacts.

Nuclear Energy

These provisions reflect a broad federal effort to modernize nuclear waste management, safeguard the uranium supply chain, enhance nuclear safety, and explore innovative nuclear technologies like microreactors.

Uranium Supply Chain Modernization

Section 3111 (Subsection 5633) mandates that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) accelerates the modernization of depleted uranium manufacturing processes by 2030, including establishing repeatable production methods and exploring off-site manufacturing options. The NNSA must report annually to Congress on the cost and progress of the program. Section 3111 (5642) requires DOE to submit biennial long-term plans through 2031 for meeting national security requirements for unencumbered uranium. These plans must include inventories, projected needs through 2070, enrichment options, industrial capabilities, potential shortfalls, and how policy changes or domestic enrichment investments could reduce reliance on adversary nations.

Section 3111 (Subsection 5643) complements this by requiring a separate report—due 120 days after enactment—on creating domestic uranium enrichment capability sufficient to meet all DOD needs through 2060. The plan must outline material requirements, milestones, funding needs, and how the U.S.-Australia-UK (AUKUS) nuclear submarine partnership affects enriched uranium demands. Annual compliance certifications will be required until the final milestone is achieved.

Microreactor Deployment

Section 922 requires the DOD to launch a pilot program for deploying microreactors at U.S. military bases. This initiative is designed to improve energy resilience and reduce dependence on vulnerable civilian power grids, signaling growing interest in small-scale, deployable nuclear power for national security infrastructure.

Critical Minerals

A new section from S.Amdt.3712 adds a critical minerals and rare earth elements mapping initiative to the Senate NDAA, reinforcing U.S. strategic resource independence and supply chain security. It authorizes the Department of the Interior, through the U.S. Geological Survey, to partner with foreign governments to cooperatively map and assess global mineral resources while prioritizing U.S. and allied access to those resources.

What's Next

The conference committee is traditionally used to resolve differences between the Senate and House on the NDAA. Conferees are House and Senate members, drawn mainly from the two armed services committees, who are expected to resolve disagreements between the House and Senate positions and provide an agreement in the form of a conference report.

Once agreed to by the conference committee, the conference report is subject to debate during floor consideration but cannot be amended. If organizations want to affect change to the final NDAA legislation, then now is the time to reach out to Congress.

Taken together, LNG export capacity in North America is projected to climb from 11.4 Bcf/d at the start of 2024 to 28.7 Bcf/d in 2029, if all projects under construction begin operating as scheduled.
That expansion would account for more than half of all new LNG capacity expected globally through 2029, according to the International Energy Agency.
Canada’s west coast LNG terminals are strategically positioned to serve Asian markets, with transit times about 50% shorter than from U.S. Gulf Coast terminals.
Outlook: A global supply shift If completed as planned, the North American LNG buildout would add more than 17 Bcf/d of new export capacity by 2029, cementing the region’s dominance in global LNG trade.","Liquefied natural gas (LNG) developers across North America are on track to more than double the region’s export capacity by the end of the decade, led by a new wave of large-scale projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Liquefaction Capacity File and trade press reports, U.S. LNG exporters have announced plans to add about 13.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of new capacity between 2025 and 2029. The United States, already the world’s largest LNG exporter, currently has 15.4 Bcf/d of installed capacity.

Taken together, LNG export capacity in North America is projected to climb from 11.4 Bcf/d at the start of 2024 to 28.7 Bcf/d in 2029, if all projects under construction begin operating as scheduled. That expansion would account for more than half of all new LNG capacity expected globally through 2029, according to the International Energy Agency.

U.S. expansion centered on Gulf Coast

Most of the new U.S. capacity will be concentrated along the Gulf Coast, where developers continue to build new liquefaction trains and marine terminals to meet global demand. The region is already the largest export hub in the Atlantic Basin.

Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 shipped its first cargo in December 2024, while Plaquemines Phase 2 and Corpus Christi Stage III began cargo shipments earlier this year, though neither has yet entered full commercial service.

Five additional U.S. export projects have reached final investment decision (FID) and are now under construction:

Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 (1.6 Bcf/d)

Rio Grande LNG (2.1 Bcf/d)

Woodside Louisiana LNG (2.2 Bcf/d)

Golden Pass LNG (2.1 Bcf/d)

CP2 LNG Phase 1 (2.0 Bcf/d)

To feed these terminals, developers are advancing new pipeline projects to move gas from major producing regions to the Gulf Coast. However, permitting and construction delays remain a potential constraint for supply growth.

Canada enters export market

Canada officially joined the ranks of LNG exporters in mid-2025 when LNG Canada shipped its first cargo from Train 1 in Kitimat, British Columbia. The facility, the country’s first LNG export terminal, can produce a combined 1.84 Bcf/d from its two liquefaction trains and is expected to reach full capacity in 2026.

A proposed second phase would double that capacity to 3.68 Bcf/d by adding two additional trains, though the expansion is not expected online until after 2029, according to the Canada Energy Regulator.

Canada’s west coast LNG terminals are strategically positioned to serve Asian markets, with transit times about 50% shorter than from U.S. Gulf Coast terminals. The projects will draw feedgas primarily from the prolific Montney Formation in Alberta and British Columbia.

Two other projects are also under construction in Western Canada:

Woodfibre LNG (0.3 Bcf/d), expected online in 2027

Cedar LNG (0.4 Bcf/d), a floating facility that reached FID in June 2024 and is scheduled to begin exports in 2028

Mexico emerges as new export route

Mexico’s LNG export sector is also taking shape, supported largely by U.S. natural gas supplies. Two projects now under construction will add a combined 0.6 Bcf/d of export capacity by the end of the decade.

The Fast LNG Altamira floating production vessel (FLNG2) on Mexico’s east coast will provide 0.2 Bcf/d of liquefaction capacity, while Energía Costa Azul on the west coast will contribute 0.4 Bcf/d.

Mexico’s first LNG cargo was produced in August 2024 from the Fast LNG Altamira FLNG1 vessel, which sources feedgas via the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline from the United States.

Outlook: A global supply shift

If completed as planned, the North American LNG buildout would add more than 17 Bcf/d of new export capacity by 2029, cementing the region’s dominance in global LNG trade. The surge in supply capacity reflects continued demand growth from Europe and Asia, where buyers are seeking long-term contracts for reliable, lower-carbon energy sources.

The expansion also underscores the shifting geography of LNG exports—anchored by the U.S. Gulf Coast, supported by new routes through Mexico, and extended to the Pacific via Canada’s west coast. Together, these developments are set to redefine global gas flows over the next decade.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20251020-150855-Gas-Lines-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 10:59:11.218518

Investing in Ukraine's underground gas storage facilities was not attractive to American players in the past when cheap Russian gas went to Europe, according to energy expert, Viktoriia Voitsitska.
""We have the Odesa–Brody pipeline, and the U.S. wants to ensure zero Russian gas and zero Russian oil,"" the president said.
Last month, President Donald Trump reprimanded Europe for continuing to purchase Russian gas and oil and called for an end to Russian imports.
""The Americans will, in any case, completely drive out Russian gas from Europe.","Ukraine has presented potential gas, nuclear, and oil projects to the White House and American companies as Washington pushes Europe to rid itself of Russian energy and fuel, Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing on Oct. 19.

Zelensky's comments come as Brussels confirms its plans to completely end Russian gas imports by 2028, while the U.S. increases its energy exports to Europe. Kyiv is also offering its energy resources to the U.S.-Ukraine reconstruction investment fund, with state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz pitching 10 projects to the fund in September.

Among the projects Kyiv is discussing with the U.S. is a terminal in Odesa to import American liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to Zelensky, who added that ""this entire gas project has been presented both at the White House and to American companies.""

For the project to work, Turkey would have to agree to unwind restrictions that prohibit LNG tankers from passing through the Bosphorus, which links the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea, he said.

Zelensky also said the U.S. was ""interested"" in Ukraine's gas storage facilities and gas network, without providing details. Ukraine’s network connects its gas fields to neighboring European nations and its massive underground gas storage facilities, the biggest in Europe.

""They see that we have the largest number of gas storage facilities and an established network — they are interested,"" he said.

Investing in Ukraine's underground gas storage facilities was not attractive to American players in the past when cheap Russian gas went to Europe, according to energy expert, Viktoriia Voitsitska. ""But since Europe has this vision of phasing out Russian fossil fuels, more and more players will be interested in selling their products to European markets,"" she said.

Another project under consideration is the Odesa-Brody oil pipeline, said Zelensky. The pipeline transports crude from Odesa to Brody on the Polish border in Lviv Oblast and is operated by the state-owned ​​company UkrTransNafta.

""We have the Odesa–Brody pipeline, and the U.S. wants to ensure zero Russian gas and zero Russian oil,"" the president said.

Zelensky also noted that the U.S. could boost Ukraine’s nuclear energy sector by erecting nine additional nuclear reactors. Nuclear power makes up half of Ukraine’s current energy generation, although six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors are located in the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The sector has strong ties with the U.S., as American nuclear firm Westinghouse provided fuel for reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant before Russia’s full-scale invasion. It planned to sell fuel to other nuclear plants in Ukraine. In July, the company inked plans for new factories in Ukraine to make parts for nuclear fuel, having previously agreed in 2022 to build nine new reactors.

To address urgent energy needs this winter after recent Russian attacks damaged 60% of Ukraine’s gas facilities, Zelensky said Kyiv could import American LNG via Poland if needed. Ukraine may need an additional $2 billion worth of gas to survive winter, with financing secured from Norway and Ukrainian banks, while gas can be sourced from Greece and Azerbaijan, said Zelensky.

The U.S., the world’s largest LNG producer, exported a record 9.4 million metric tons of LNG to Europe, its top market, in September. While Europe is increasing American LNG imports this year, it still brought nearly 5 billion euros worth of Russian LNG in the first half of 2025 — 1 billion euros more than the same period last year.

Last month, President Donald Trump reprimanded Europe for continuing to purchase Russian gas and oil and called for an end to Russian imports.

""The Americans will, in any case, completely drive out Russian gas from Europe. We must understand — regardless of various agreements — that Russia has lost Europe to the Americans,"" Zelensky said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:11:22.375512

These measures underscore a renewed commitment to ensuring that the clean energy transition delivers prosperity and dignity for every worker.","The UK’s clean energy revolution is poised to create a record-breaking 400,000 new clean energy jobs by 2030, doubling the size of the current workforce and transforming the nation’s industrial landscape.

Backed by major government and private investment, this boom is fuelling demand for skilled workers across every corner of the country – from electricians and plumbers to welders and engineers.

UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband explained: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and we are publishing a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Green jobs boom backed by record investment

Driven by the government’s clean energy mission, more than £50bn in private investment has flowed into the sector since last July.

Projects like the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which will support up to 10,000 clean energy jobs at peak construction, and the Rolls-Royce small modular reactor programme, expected to create 3,000 roles, are at the forefront of this industrial resurgence.

The government’s green light for carbon capture projects such as Acorn in Scotland and Viking in the North East adds a further 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships.

Combined with ongoing carbon capture, usage and storage initiatives in the North West and Teesside, the clean energy sector is fast becoming one of the UK’s largest sources of industrial employment.

National strategy to train the next generation

For the first time, the UK Government will publish a comprehensive national plan to train the next generation of clean energy workers.

This landmark workforce strategy aims to ensure that the 860,000 jobs expected by 2030 are not only plentiful, but also high-quality and well-paid.

At the heart of this plan are five new Technical Excellence Colleges, dedicated to equipping young people with the skills needed for careers in renewables, nuclear, and advanced energy systems.

Pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire – worth a combined £2.5 million – will support new training centres, courses and career advice.

Education providers, industry leaders and local authorities will collaborate under one cohesive framework, aligning skills training with real-world demand in 31 priority occupations, including welders, electricians and engineers.

Empowering veterans, ex-offenders and oil & gas workers

A series of tailored initiatives aims to open clean energy jobs to a wider workforce. In partnership with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a veterans’ transition programme, matching ex-service members with roles in wind, solar and nuclear energy.

For ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed, targeted schemes will provide training pathways into skilled energy roles – tapping into a pool of over 13,000 people who already possess relevant skills from previous industries.

Meanwhile, workers from traditional oil and gas backgrounds will benefit from up to £20m in retraining funds.

The successful Aberdeen skills pilot is being expanded nationwide, alongside the extension of the Energy Skills Passport, helping offshore workers seamlessly transfer into clean energy roles such as offshore wind and grid maintenance.

Better pay and fairer work in the clean energy economy

Clean energy jobs are not only plentiful – they’re lucrative. Entry-level roles in this sector pay 23% more than equivalent positions elsewhere, while jobs in wind, nuclear and grid infrastructure offer average salaries exceeding £50,000, compared to the UK’s national average of £37,000.

The government’s new Fair Work Charter, developed with trade unions, will guarantee strong pay, secure contracts and safe conditions for all workers in the clean energy industry.

In addition, new legislation will extend employment protections, including the National Minimum Wage, to offshore clean energy workers beyond UK territorial waters.

These measures underscore a renewed commitment to ensuring that the clean energy transition delivers prosperity and dignity for every worker.

Building a future-ready workforce

As demand for skilled labour surges, the government has pledged to restore trade unions’ role as key partners in shaping modern workplaces.

With union membership in the energy sector down from 70% in the 1990s to around 30% today, ministers see collaboration as vital to securing fair pay and good conditions across the industry.

The UK’s clean energy transformation also aligns with broader education reforms announced by the Prime Minister, setting a target for two-thirds of young people to engage in higher-level learning – whether academic, technical or through apprenticeships – by age 25.

Powering Britain’s clean energy future

From the industrial heartlands of Teesside to the coastal wind farms of the East of England, where 60,000 people are expected to be employed in the sector by 2030, the clean energy revolution is reshaping Britain’s economic future.

As investment accelerates, opportunities expand, and pay rises, the UK is positioning itself as a global leader in clean energy jobs – delivering not just a net-zero future, but a fairer, more prosperous one for all.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2247342469-696x376-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:29.152757

According to an Ocober 10 ruling signed by district judge Judge Penelope Richard, the Office of Coastal Management under the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources did not consider several factors when issuing the permit.

The court finds that the LDENR – OCM “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative

impacts, specifically this facility’s impact on climate-related change in the coastal zone, if any, in conjunction with the other LNG facilities in the area.”

Moreover, the LDENR – OCM also “failed to consider environmental justice issues in its basis of decision.”

“Based on the OCM’s failure to consider these two issues, the court hereby remands this case to the OCM, for further proceedings, as may be appropriate. The coastal use permit will be vacated until such time that the OCM has considered these issues in issuing the CUP to Commonwealth and makes a finding that the benefits of this project outweigh the costs to the community,” it said.

Kimmeridge’s Commonwealth told FERC in its newest monthly status report it was notified that its coastal use permit had been vacated and remanded to the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy Office of Permitting and Compliance, formerly LDENR-OCM, to fully consider two issues raised during public comment about the proposed project.

The project is “working with our state officials and regulators to resolve this matter as quickly as possible, while ensuring our permit record fully demonstrates the project’s compliance with all regulatory criteria.”

“The project will notify the Commission when the permit is reissued. Site preparation activities will not be initiated until such time,” Commonwealth said.

Pivot Energy commits to community donation funds that are injected into the local community for every megawatt of solar installed.","Climate urgency, shifting regulations and rising community expectations are reshaping how clean energy is delivered. Solar is no longer a niche asset class, it sits at the heart of how organisations decarbonise, reduce costs and build energy resilience.

For Pivot Energy, that mission is both commercial and social. Founded in 2009, the company develops, constructs, finances, owns and manages onsite and offsite solar projects across the US.

Today, Pivot Energy is a leading independent power producer and Certified B Corp. Its portfolio spans 4.1 GW and nearly 1,800 projects completed or in development, delivering reliable renewable power and tangible benefits to host communities.

Agrivoltaics is now a strategic pillar for the firm; instead of choosing between farmland and photovoltaics, Pivot Energy integrates both to improve land productivity and local livelihoods.

Angela Burke is driving that shift. As Director of Operations at Pivot Energy since 2022, Angela has spearheaded the company’s agrivoltaics strategy and operations.

Her leadership is accelerating a 100% agrivoltaics portfolio, turning ambition into deployment at pace.

The result is thousands of grazing sheep and dozens of new solar farmers working productively beneath panels.

Recognised as the 2024 North American Agrivoltaics “Champion of the Year”, Angela is a vocal advocate for solar farming and a practical operator focused on safety, quality and long-term performance.

In this interview with Sustainability Magazine, Angela shares her expertise of agrivoltaics with us.

What is agrivoltaics?

Agrivoltaics, also known as dual use solar, is an approach that integrates solar panel production with agricultural production on existing farmland usually between 5 acres and 50 acres.

Pivot Energy, who has been utilising some element of agrivoltaics on its qualified solar sites since 2022 and currently has 72 active dual use solar projects, more than any other solar developer.

Pivot follows a three-pronged strategic agrivoltaics approach that focuses on livestock grazing, enhanced habitat and crop production.

More than 95% of the solar sites Pivot operates include at least one of these land stewardship practices:

Livestock grazing

Multiple types of animals: sheep, chicken, pigs, alpaca, llamas, ducks and other livestock can be integrated into the solar array area to complete grazing activities that manage vegetation while also improving soil health.

Today, more than 3,200 sheep are grazing on 700 acres of dual use solar across 6 states.

Enhanced habitat

Planting customised native, low-growth plant seed mixes that flower throughout the year to maximise pollinator benefits.

Pivot Energy’s site plans also incorporate native crops, wildflowers and we partner with apiaries to house bee hives to pollinate land and produce honey to sell.

Crop production

Pilot sites’ harvests include vegetables such as radishes, daikon, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions.

April 2024, Pivot led first-ever U.S. PV+Crop+Subsurface Drip Irrigation configuration that was installed in LaSalle, CO.

In late April of 2025, Pivot’s farm partner tilled and planted the site and we look forward to seeing the first harvest this fall.

Pilot PV+Cropping site in IL will support a hay/alfalfa crop to be harvested 2-3 times annually.

These pilot projects are integral to achieving Pivot’s overall goal of adopting agrivoltaics as a standard and at scale.

What is the impact of these?

Pivot works with landowners to sign long-term leases between 20 and 40 years in order to develop purpose-driven community-scale solar projects.

This enables landowners to receive dual-use solar projects that are helping to restore soil quality, increase ecosystem functioning and create pollinator habitats under the solar panels in rural communities across the country.

Almost all of Pivot’s ground-mounted sites have committed to dual-use agricultural practices and we have more solar grazing sites than most U.S. developers.

The benefits of agrivoltaics include soil enrichment where sustainable seeding and land practices and fertilisers enhance soil health over a solar array’s lifetime.

Additionally, shade reduces the amount of water needed for irrigation and in return, the vegetation underneath the solar panels keeps those panels cooler, boosting operational efficiency and the amount of electricity they produce.

Overall, it reduces the need for fossil-fueled vegetation management, machinery, herbicides and pesticides.

Agrivoltaics sites also provide impactful financial benefits to the community.

Undoubtedly, energy security was a key factor for the 20+ countries that signed a declaration to triple nuclear energy in 2023 at COP 28.
Energy security is vital for economic growth and national security.","Summary:

Energy security was particularly topical in 2022, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a global energy crisis, with pronounced severity in Europe. Oil prices temporarily rose above $120 per barrel in the first half of 2022, and even the U.S. felt the pain, despite being the world’s largest oil producer.

The Biden Administration responded with the largest-ever release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in coordination with the International Energy Agency (IEA). Both the SPR and the IEA were actually born out of the energy crises in the 1970s.

The impact of higher prices for oil and liquefied natural gas were broad, albeit most severe for the European Union. Prior to the invasion, Russia accounted for 50% of EU oil imports and over 60% of the EU’s natural gas imports.

In retrospect, the EU was able to pivot away from Russian imports in fairly quick order, limiting Russia’s ability to further weaponize its natural gas exports. However, improving energy affordability and being better prepared for price crises are key focuses of the EU’s energy policy going forward.

While energy security tends to come into focus during geopolitical unrest or unexpected supply disruptions, it isn’t just an event-driven issue. Energy security also encompasses reliability and affordability, which are perennially important for the economy, quality of life, and safety. With electricity demand expected to grow globally, sufficient and affordable power is critical to economies and central to an ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) arms race.

From an energy security standpoint, AI is arguably a mixed bag. For example, AI can help energy companies combat cyberattacks, albeit those attacks have become more complex due to AI. Meanwhile, AI data centers are driving more electricity demand, which could put upward pressure on energy prices.

On the other hand, hyperscalers have been quick to support innovative power solutions, including advanced nuclear (read more). Hyperscalers have plenty of capital to back new projects, while their influence in Washington can also help ease the path for nuclear. Nuclear support is one area of continuity in energy policy from the Biden to the Trump administration (read more), with the U.S. military also focused on advanced nuclear as exemplified by an announcement last week.

In the U.S., power demand has largely been flat for 20 years, so a shift to growing electricity demand is notable. The U.S. will need plenty of affordable power from a range of sources, including renewables, natural gas, and nuclear. The political focus may even move from prices at the pump to monthly electricity bills.

Energy security concerns in the 1970s were part of the impetus for the robust build-out of nuclear capacity in the ’70s and ’80s in the U.S., as shown below. Undoubtedly, energy security was a key factor for the 20+ countries that signed a declaration to triple nuclear energy in 2023 at COP 28. Signatories include the U.S., Canada, Japan, and several European countries. In total, 31 countries have now signed on to the declaration to triple nuclear power by 2050.

It is not surprising that countries are turning to nuclear. Its carbon-free power generation is important for meeting climate goals, while its reliability can complement intermittent renewables.

Energy security is vital for economic growth and national security. Countries around the world are recognizing the importance of nuclear power in addressing energy security concerns, sparking a new nuclear renaissance. For investors, this can represent a compelling growth opportunity. The Range Nuclear Renaissance Index (NUKZ ) includes global companies participating in this long-term megatrend.

What's happening?

A new analysis from the national nonprofit E2 shows the industry added about 100,000 jobs in 2024 and now employs more than 3.5 million people. But federal efforts to roll back support for renewable projects and domestic manufacturing have put that momentum, along with thousands of local paychecks, on the line.

As Reuters reported, gains stretched from factories to construction sites, with the strongest growth last year in Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, and New Jersey. Energy-efficiency roles alone accounted for roughly 2.4 million positions nationwide. E2's Bob Keefe warned the clean energy sector's growth is now ""at serious risk — and with it, our overall economy,"" per Reuters.

That risk isn't abstract: The administration is weighing additional multibillion-dollar cuts to clean-energy funds after canceling other awards, which is a shift that could stall projects, hiring, and private investment tied to them.

Why are these policy changes important?

These are not niche jobs. The clean energy workforce outnumbers oil, gas, and coal jobs by about three to one, according to E2, anchoring supply chains for heat pumps, batteries, and modernized grids that lower household energy costs and improve air quality.

Communities in fast-growing states — from Gulf Coast manufacturing hubs to Mountain West construction crews — stand to lose the most if factories pause retooling and developers shelve projects.

There's also a consumer knock-on effect: When grid upgrades and efficient equipment slip, families face higher bills and more frequent outages during heat waves and winter storms — exactly when reliable power matters most. Globally, renewables are surging, which underscores how retreating here could mean ceding jobs and competitiveness to other countries.

What's being done about these changes?

States are moving to keep demand and jobs alive. California and New York have rules requiring all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035, sustaining investment in EV supply chains and charging. A recent federal decision also shielded California's clean-car waiver from a fast-track repeal in Congress, adding regulatory certainty automakers say they need to invest.

People can choose high-efficiency appliances when replacing old ones, opt into community solar where available, and support local policies that expand building upgrades and grid modernization.

These are the kinds of purchases and programs that keep electricians, factory workers, and installers on the job. Paired with durable state standards and stable federal funding, those choices help hold together a workforce that has become a backbone of community resilience.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lsK87tiSQ1uhXAhYTb4jTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/36e36b02cc5f8790ec45ada720b5a3a9,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:33.327791

Billions in Cuts Would Harm Clean Energy Hubs Across the Country

On October 2, the Trump administration announced $7.6 billion in cuts targeted at clean energy projects. Many experts are concerned over potential project cancellations in more states as the government shutdown continues. For instance, the South Texas Direct Air Capture Hub and the Louisiana Project Cypress Air Capture Project, both supported by bipartisan groups of lawmakers, stand to lose funding from cuts. More troubling are at-risk multi-state initiatives, such as the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, which invests throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

Future cuts could contribute to higher power prices as electricity demand rises, leading many companies to move their investments outside the country. Carbon removal hubs in Louisiana and Texas and offshore wind projects on the east coast are predicted to create thousands of high-paying jobs in the clean energy industry. If the Department of Energy (DOE) decides to make these cuts, the United States will move even further away from a just transition to clean energy.

News and Updates

FEMA Cancels $11B in Disaster Payments to States

In a report released in late September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) publicly confirmed that the administration withheld $10.9 billion in critical disaster assistance from more than 45 states.

In addition to this rescission of previously approved funds, FEMA’s proposed budget would significantly cut the agency’s disaster spending by tens of billions of dollars. The states that the budget shortfall would most heavily impact are New York, California, Maryland, Georgia, Florida, and Pennsylvania. These states all experience increasingly frequent extreme weather disasters made worse by climate change.

For First Time, Renewables Beat Out Coal in Total Generation Globally

In the first six months of the year, renewable energy sources like wind and solar generated more electricity globally than coal, according to a report published this month by energy think tank Ember. As the United States deprioritizes renewables, green energy has made historic gains around the rest of the world.

“We are seeing the first signs of a crucial turning point,” Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember, stated within the report. While the lead renewables had over coal this year is small, the trajectory is clear: solar and wind are surging because they are increasingly very cheap compared to coal. In the U.S. a study found that 99 percent of coal plants are more expensive to run than renewable replacements would be. Renewables are cheaper, healthier, and overall better than their coal alternatives to generate electricity, which puts us on a strong path forward as we counter the climate crisis.

At the time, I described hydropower as ‘the forgotten giant of electricity’.
“That’s similar to all the power produced worldwide by solar and wind combined, and 50% more than the amount generated from nuclear plants,” Birol noted.
“Many hydropower plants in advanced economies are over 40 years old.
And I hope that in another four years’ time, hydropower will no longer be a forgotten giant.”","The Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol, has renewed his call for the global energy community to give hydropower the attention it deserves, warning that the sector remains “the forgotten giant of electricity.”

In a LinkedIn post published on October 17, Birol said that four years after the IEA released its major report on hydropower, the technology continues to be left out of key energy policy discussions despite its central role in global electricity systems.

“Four years ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a major report on hydropower. It noted that hydro is often left out of conversations on energy, despite its huge role in electricity systems around the world. At the time, I described hydropower as ‘the forgotten giant of electricity’. Unfortunately, this is still the case today,” Birol wrote.

Hydropower remains the third largest source of power generation worldwide, after coal and natural gas, generating around 4,500 terawatt-hours of electricity last year — 14% of global supply. “That’s similar to all the power produced worldwide by solar and wind combined, and 50% more than the amount generated from nuclear plants,” Birol noted.

Hydropower, Birol said, is uniquely placed to help countries meet rising electricity demand as the world enters what the IEA has described as a “new Age of Electricity.”

“Hydropower can help meet this increasing power consumption as populations and economies grow, electrification advances and investment pours into digital infrastructure like data centres,” he said.

Birol also highlighted hydropower’s role as a dispatchable low-emissions source of electricity with “unmatched capabilities when it comes to flexibility.”

“Hydro plants can quickly adjust their generation up and down – and can be stopped and restarted relatively smoothly. This enables them to quickly adapt to shifts in demand, helping to keep the lights on in times of strain – and usually at a lower cost than most nuclear or coal plants,” he wrote.

He added that hydropower is a crucial partner to renewables: “In periods when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow, hydro can quickly and cheaply fill the gaps.”

Birol also underlined hydropower’s critical role in electricity storage, noting that pumped storage hydro plants “are currently the largest form of electricity storage worldwide, with the capacity to hold 30 times more power than batteries.”

Birol pointed out that in many advanced economies, hydro plants are decades old and in need of refurbishment.

“Many hydropower plants in advanced economies are over 40 years old. Refurbishing them is vital to sustain output, and owners should consider simultaneous upgrades that improve flexibility and storage,” he said.

In contrast, developing and emerging economies hold vast untapped potential.

“In emerging and developing economies – where about 60% of hydro potential remains untapped – hydropower can both expand energy access and power industrialisation, spurring economic growth,” Birol wrote.

He emphasized the multiple benefits hydropower can bring to communities and industries alike — from low-cost electricity and irrigation services to jobs and cross-border trade.

Calling for urgent action, Birol urged governments to make financing more accessible and affordable, speed up permitting processes, and strengthen the resilience of hydropower infrastructure in the face of changing rainfall patterns due to climate change.

“Hydropower development requires long-term planning, so challenges need to be addressed now,” he said. “This is why I believe it’s essential to move hydropower up today’s energy policy agenda.”

“These actions can be taken now. And I hope that in another four years’ time, hydropower will no longer be a forgotten giant.”",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/1760636026652.png,N,,2025-10-20 12:11:43.985187

It comes as the UK Government has published a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.

The plan will set out clear workforce estimates for the first time, and aims for industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

For young people, the government said the jobs can offer higher levels of pay – with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles.

Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed

Upskill existing workers – Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy.

The plan also includes proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have good quality pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50%.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

“Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said:

“We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry – and will drive growth across the nation.”

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

“Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.”

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, said:

“After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy – as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.”

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said:

“GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs.”

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT, said:

“RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain.”

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said:

“Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.”

Alasdair McDiarmid, Assistant General Secretary at Community Union, said:

“The push for new clean energy jobs will also support our members in both the light industries and steel sector, with steel being an essential component for green energy infrastructure and construction.”

Sue Ferns OBE, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect, said:

“The infrastructure investment required to achieve the government’s clean energy mission must be backed by a major boost to jobs and skills. If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development. In this context is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.”

Frances O’Grady, Former General Secretary of the TUC, said:

“Energy workers and their families are at the heart of this plan – showing the clean energy transition provides not just energy security but job security.”

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said:

“Well paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition. Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights. The actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.”

Chris O’Shea, Chief Executive of Centrica, said:

“We have committed to creating a new apprenticeship for every day of this decade. These new secure, skilled, well-paid jobs are key to unlocking the economic growth the UK so desperately needs.”

Keith Anderson, CEO of ScottishPower, said:

“Thanks to the clear direction set out by the government’s Clean Power 2030 Mission, we’re investing at record levels in the clean electricity infrastructure the UK needs for energy security and economic growth.”

EDF power solutions UK CEO Matthieu Hue said:

“We welcome the plan which brings clarity on the scale of the opportunity for people across the UK to work in high quality jobs which will contribute to our electric future.”

Darren Davidson, Vice President of Siemens Energy UK&I, said:

“Siemens Energy is a major employer in the UK with 6,500 workers at sites across the UK. We have taken on 140 new apprentices this autumn, and we currently have more than 200 active vacancies.”

Chris Norbury, CEO of E.ON UK, said:

“Clean power is a defining opportunity to grow the economy, strengthen energy security, and create skilled jobs that support communities nationwide. We welcome the Clean Energy Jobs Plan as a vital step towards building the workforce to realise that potential.”

Michael Lewis, CEO Uniper said:

“Uniper aims to invest approximately €8 billion into growth and transformation projects by the early 2030s, including solar and onshore wind projects, hydrogen projects, and a new combined-cycle gas turbine power station with carbon capture technology at our Connah’s Quay site – contributing to the retention and creation of jobs, and supporting the regional economy.”

Zac Richardson, Group Chief Engineer at National Grid, said:

“Secure, affordable and clean energy is essential to unlocking UK economic growth and productivity – ambitions which are underpinned by electricity networks and the unprecedented levels of planned investment in them.”

Tania Kumar, Director of Net Zero at the CBI, said:

“The growth of the clean energy economy is creating opportunities for people and places across the whole of the UK. The launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan offers a tangible way to connect communities with both the opportunities emerging across the sector and the businesses at the forefront of delivering them.”

Dhara Vyas, CEO of Energy UK, said:

“Today’s announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system. It rightly recognises the need to tackle the skills challenge collectively by investing in both new talent and our existing workforce.”

Jane Cooper, Deputy Chief Executive at Renewable UK, said:

“The Clean Energy Jobs Plan sets out the scale of the massive opportunity which the UK has to create tens of thousands of new jobs in renewables all over the country. “

Katy Heidenreich Supply Chain and People Director at Offshore Energies UK, said:

“Investing in skills development is essential to support the UK’s energy sector and it is encouraging to see governments recognise the huge resource of our oil and gas workforce and how their skills can be developed to provide the expertise needed for the energy mix of the future.”

Claire Mack OBE, Chief Executive of Scottish Renewables, said:

“The clean power mission is not just about energy security for the country, it’s about good jobs and a workforce fit the future in your locale. The scale and importance of the energy transition requires new approaches to ensure investments in skills, apprenticeships and training serve the needs of the entire economy.”

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

“The net zero economy is continuing to grow, and the Clean Energy Jobs Plan clearly sets out how the government will recruit essential workers who are critical for the UK’s energy transition. This will support both net zero and economic growth across the UK, providing certainty for people and local communities. “

Verity Davidge, Director of Policy and Public Affairs, at Make UK said:

“Manufacturers are moving at pace to invest in decarbonisation and net zero projects and the transition to clean energy offers huge opportunities for industry. To take full advantage, companies will need to have access to increasingly higher levels of skills and a talent pipeline which will fuel the growth we need to see.”

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said:

“We welcome the Clean Energy Jobs Plan’s recognition that hydrogen will be vital to net zero and to creating high-quality jobs. Much of the oil and gas workforce already has transferable skills, and supporting their transition into hydrogen will be key to a just and rapid shift to a clean energy economy.”

Olivia Powis, CEO of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said:

“We welcome the Clean Jobs Plan and its recognition of the vital role CCUS and hydrogen will play in achieving the UK’s growth and decarbonisation goals while keeping industries competitive. Developing the necessary skills base is crucial to unlocking these sectors’ full potential and protecting thousands of existing industrial jobs.”

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said:

“This Jobs Plan shows the huge opportunity clean power offers the UK, and the vital role nuclear will play in delivering it. With 100,000 people already working in nuclear in good, skilled jobs across the country, new stations like Sizewell C and a fleet of SMRs will create thousands more — especially for young people — in clean and secure energy.”

Chris Hewett, Chief Executive, Solar Energy UK, said:

“Solar energy and battery energy storage already support over 20,000 British jobs, with expectations that the sectors will employ more than twice the number in 10 years’ time. But to reach our goals for cheaper, cleaner power, we need to redouble our efforts to attract and train staff for these fast-growing sectors. With our Solar Careers UK programme and critical support from government under the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, we have every expectation that our aspirations will be fulfilled.”

Yselkla Farmer, CEO of BEAMA, said:

“We have a long heritage of manufacturing for the electricity industry in the UK. As a supply chain at the heart of the clean energy sector we know the growth potential is substantial as we electrify our energy system. “

Lawrence Slade, CEO of Energy Networks Association, said:

“This plan is an important step towards accelerating the real economic benefits of the clean energy transition right around the country. Today network operators employ around 26,000 people and facilitate 1,500 apprenticeships, in order to maintain the safe, reliable operation of over 500,000 miles of wires and cables.”

Lieutenant General (Retd) Richard Nugee CB CVO CBE, Chair, Mission Renewable, said:

“The Clean Energy Jobs Plan reflects the valuable contributions those who have served have made and can continue to make to the nation. By linking veterans and their families with career opportunities in the clean energy sector, Mission Renewable helps companies tap into and retain skilled talent, while at the same time enabling Armed Forces communities to thrive and feel valued.”

Paul Cox, Group CEO of Energy & Utility Skills, said:

“For the government to achieve its 2030 target, we must put people at the heart of that ambition – only by having the right people with the right skills will we deliver the UK’s energy future.”

David Hughes, Chief Executive of Association of Colleges, said:

“This exciting plan will help people get the skills they need to secure good work locally and it is great to see the investment in colleges to back the government’s ambitions on a net zero future.”",https://transportandenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1530086603-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:38.210144

(Reuters) — The Trump administration's plans to cancel nearly $8 billion in Energy Department grants are illegal because contracts had already been signed and will cause consumer energy prices to skyrocket, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate energy committee said on Oct. 16.

Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled $7.56 billion in funding for clean energy projects that it claimed would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

""These are projects that would have added energy to the grid and added flexibility,"" Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said. ""The administration is constraining the energy that we can put on the grid, and at the end of the day, this is going to raise energy costs for consumers.""

Heinrich said that 218 of the 233 projects ranging from battery storage to green hydrogen were located in states with Democratic governors.

Soaring home electricity bills, driven largely by skyrocketing electricity demand by data centers to power artificial intelligence, have become a top voter concern, and one that Democrats hope to seize on ahead of upcoming gubernatorial elections and next year's congressional elections.

Heinrich said retail electricity prices were already 10% higher year over year even before the cuts were proposed.

The Energy Department has said it is prioritizing oil, gas and coal energy, which it says will meet baseload demand needed by data centers and lower prices.

""Americans were upset, and rightfully upset, of four years of extreme expenditures, spent money, and the net result of spending money to subsidize energy that was more expensive energy,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters on Oct. 16.

“It’s a voluntary program,” an Xcel spokesman told the news outlet.
“It erodes personal choice, home comfort, and the basic right to control appliances and vehicles you paid for with your own money.
However, when the grid gets overwhelmed, for any reason, the companies can take control and shut down air, heat, and hot water.
Ultimately, public utility companies exist to serve the public and cater to their convenience – not the other way around.","Ohio – which has a Republican governor and Republican supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature – has become the latest state to consider legislation allowing utility companies to seize control of thermostats during heat waves or shut off hot water during peak demand in the name of protecting the power grid. Other states are considering similar measures that critics say represent an egregious violation of private property rights and shift blame to customers for the failure of politicians and utility companies to improve grid capacity and reliability.

The legislation under consideration in the Buckeye State is being sold as an effort to “modernize Ohio’s energy regulations and help homeowners and small businesses save money while improving electric grid reliability.” The bill would create “voluntary demand response programs, where participating customers can allow utilities to temporarily adjust energy usage, such as raising thermostat settings or cycling water heaters, during periods of high demand.”

Rep. Klopfenstein claims customers could “override these actions” and that other states have implemented similar programs with success.

“Demand response programs have proven to be a vital tool for our large commercial users, and it’s important that similar programs are made available to residential and small commercial users,” the Republican claimed. “These programs will ease the strain on our energy grid and save money for all Ohioans.”

But the experience of other states shows that these promises are paper thin, and there’s no guarantee customers will always be able to “override” the controls.

Colorado serves as a cautionary tale. There, Xcel Energy operates a voluntary program that also promised tens of thousands of residents they could override the controls if they chose.

But during an “energy emergency” caused by equipment failure in 2022, ABC News’s Denver affiliate reported that Coloradans “learned they had no control over the temperatures in their own homes” even as a heat wave washed over the state.

“I mean, it was 90 out, and it was right during the peak period,” Tony Talarico told the outlet. “It was hot.” Talarico said that “normally” he is able to override the thermostat lock, but “[i]n this case, we weren’t. So, our thermostat was locked in at 78 or 79.”

Asked for comment, the utility company shockingly blamed the customers and emphasized that they signed up for the program (leaving out that they were promised they could bypass the controls).

“It’s a voluntary program,” an Xcel spokesman told the news outlet. “Let’s remember that this is something that customers choose to be a part of based on the incentives.”

But as Colorado Public Radio noted, the utility program changed the rules in the middle of the game. While the program says it can be used during “the hottest summer days,” it said nothing about “thermostat adjustments due to equipment failures.”

Other states have proposed going much further, taking away any agency for consumers and forcing them into the program. A bill in Connecticut, for instance, backed by both Democrats and Republicans, would give utility companies the same ability to take over not just thermostats and water heaters, but also electric cars, inverting the batteries to put power back into the grid.

Some people fear that this is part of a larger plan to restrict energy usage and make government even more invasive in the lives of everyday Americans. “This legislation is a slippery slope toward centralized, government control of private energy use,” Chris Herb, CEO and president of Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, said in April. “It erodes personal choice, home comfort, and the basic right to control appliances and vehicles you paid for with your own money. When does it end?”

Others have pointed out that the companies are charging customers more for not having smart meters, which could coerce Social Security recipients and other low-income individuals into signing up to save money. The program may appear to give customers free will, but imposed costs for not complying will effectively force many to submit to allowing utility companies to control their air conditioner and other appliances.

“Participation in programs like AC Rewards [in Minnesota] will be voluntary at first, but like the $180 fee, I predict the extra costs associated with not allowing the utility to control your power will eventually become cost-prohibitive, especially for low-income families and businesses,” Isaac Orr, an energy researcher with the Center of the American Experiment, warned in 2024.

These “voluntary” programs all start the same way: they come into houses under the guise of installing helpful “smart meters” with the supposedly altruistic goal of helping Americans save a few dollars on electricity. Oftentimes the companies even offer $100 or more as a “gift” for compliance.

However, when the grid gets overwhelmed, for any reason, the companies can take control and shut down air, heat, and hot water. Instead of focusing on fixing the problems underlying the grid failures – like overreliance on wind and solar, the decommissioning of fossil fuels plants, and decades of deferred maintenance – the companies simply turn the blame and burden back onto the customer.

The animal health company’s homecoming signaled a new commitment to innovation and an era of collaboration in a space emerging with opportunity: One Health (the intersection of animal, plant, human and environmental health).

In partnership with Purdue University and the State of Indiana, Elanco’s campus includes the OneHealth Innovation District, a community-centered research hub designed to unite corporate innovators, academic researchers, students, investors and government leaders to advance science and inspire innovation. Indiana’s $72.4 billion agbioscience economy, coupled with its leading life sciences sector, positions the state to lead in the exploration, development and growth of this new economy and its impact on the planet.

AgriNovus CEO, Christy Wright, remarks that this concept holds tremendous opportunity across the value chain. “The One Health discussion generates new ideas simply by understanding what problems can be solved through cross-sectional collaboration. It also brings to surface new perspectives on how innovation in food and nutrition fit into the larger discussion of the One Health portfolio.”

Elanco’s OneHealth Innovation District bolsters this concept significantly, and the success stories are already rolling in Indiana. Let’s examine a few.

BiomEdit exploring the untapped potential of the microbiome

Elanco announced in 2021 the intention to carve out its microbiome platform and pipeline. About six months later, BiomEdit was launched in Indiana to explore the ways that the health of animals, humans and the environment are influenced by the populations of bacterial species they host. They leverage the animal’s own microbial ecosystem to innovate solutions where none exist – preventing disease and focusing on critical issues like food security and methane emission reduction.

BiomEdit has a long-term strategic research and commercial partnership with Nutreco, to bring livestock and aquaculture producers feed additives developed through microbiome technology. They have also received a $4.5 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to accelerate research and development of novel microbiome-based solutions to reduce methane emissions that also enhance feed efficiency for beef and dairy cattle.

Their technology, BE-101 has entered the final phase of the USDA conditional licensure process and is advancing toward commercialization, expected in 2026. Assuming the name “Optavant,” it is the first-of-its-kind probiotic vectored antibody designed to prevent mortality associated with necrotic enteritis (NE) in broiler chickens. The disease causes an estimated $6 billion in annual losses worldwide.

Corteva Agriscience accelerating disruptive innovation through Corteva Catalyst

Corteva Catalyst, the company’s investment and partnership platform, was launched in 2024 focused on accessing and bringing to market innovation that accelerates the development of early-stage, disruptive technologies that enable farmers to sustainably produce more food and feed. Six months later they announced an equity stake and strategic collaboration in Pairwise, a technology company accelerating the delivery of advanced gene editing solutions to farmers, ultimately benefiting the environment and consumers.

A five-year joint venture, Pairwise and Corteva are leveraging both companies’ advanced gene editing capabilities to generate and evaluate unique gene edits across multiple traits in a range of crops to develop and deploy new products that are more resilient to extreme weather events and climate change.

Also enabled through Corteva Catalyst in 2025 was the strategic collaboration with Profluent Bio, a pioneer in generative AI for protein design, to deliver a new generation of more sustainable, resilient crops. This partnership integrates with Corteva’s Genlytix ecosystem, a set of industry-leading capabilities that enable gene editing and its future role in plant breeding, including precision to improve yield, pest resistance, tolerance to drought and heat, and quality – creating dependable solutions for growers around the world.

Startup landscape emerging across One Health, food is health

AgriNovus identified Food is Health as a priority for Indiana’s innovation future in its Accelerate 2050 strategy and there is early-stage innovation quickly emerging and contributing to the overall One Health picture.

True Essence Foods is a technology company focused on licensing flavor balancing and symmetry solutions for the food and beverage industry.

FloVision Solutions leverages automated data collection and actionable insights to optimize protein quality, processes and yield.

NutriPop is a healthy super food snack made from popped water lily seeds that is 130 calories and 3 grams of protein per serving.

Earth Life Foods is a plant-based food manufacturing company that offers their own branded products, bulk packaging, private labeling and non-GMO, vegan and non-vegan options.

As the focus of One Health continues to crystalize and collaborations evolve, Wright encourages leaders to consider new conversations that feel unconventional. “Across Indiana’s leading R1 academic institutions, agbioscience and life sciences ecosystems, there is a massive opportunity to identify, ideate and solve some of the biggest challenges facing One Health. The conversations need to start in rooms with new faces where we learn new things, and that’s an exciting endeavor.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BQ48t7yUlqk48ls0GQXpcR8nipu9I_vB8oYMIaW6EuE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9lbGFuY29fZ2xvYmFsX2hxXy1fa3ZfOTgxNC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-20 10:07:02.538556

Hope in data centre development?
However, BESS being tied to data centre development is not necessarily a sure thing.
Morrison says, “I think people have not totally figured out yet what role battery storage is going to play with data centres.
But we’ve not seen that deployed at the same scale as we have other technologies for purposes of behind-the-meter delivery to data centres.","This policy is expected to significantly affect Chinese companies or those with over 20% Chinese ownership, beginning at the end of this year.

As seen in Troutman Pepper Locke’s report and noted by other analysts, such as BloombergNEF’s Isshu Kikuma, the US is expected to see a significant amount of load growth over the next decade, primarily from the rapid development of data centres.

Industry discussion has seen data centre development as a potential lifeline for continued BESS project development.

Morrison highlights how companies are responding to the FEOC restrictions, as well as the pros and cons of integrating BESS with data centres.

The impacts of FEOC restrictions

“Battery storage emerged relatively unscathed from this budget reconciliation process, at least in the near and medium terms,” Morrison says.

“If you look at where the industry is now compared to where it was before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed, when there were no tax credits for battery storage except to the extent paired with solar-plus-storage, the industry is much better off, for sure.”

Morrison hopes to see the industry grow, but acknowledges the current confusion companies are experiencing in maintaining eligibility requirements and navigating FEOC restrictions.

“There are developers that are closely held, and that’s the end of the discussion. Others are owned by hundreds of LPs, which is more complex. And then there are those who have publicly issued debt, multiple tranches of publicly issued debt over time. Going back and trying to figure out who it was sold to at the time of the issuance is just a Herculean task.”

John Leonti, a partner at Troutman, who contributed to the report with Morrison, notes, “The most prepared in the sector have acted nimbly to restructure supply chains, and key stakeholders are strengthening their close working relationships to share risk and collaboratively revise strategies.”

Morrison says a large focus has been placed on avoiding the need to restructure arrangements to allocate risk in the first place.

This is complicated because if a taxpayer, potentially including a tax equity investor, is the “wrong type” of entity, it could lead to a disallowance.

Morrison clarifies that when an FEOC holds too much of a taxpayer’s debt, it can lead to disallowance. Consequently, some companies are considering including representations and covenants to shift the risk to the party best able to manage it.

He says, “Our primary focus has been on negotiating risk allocation with suppliers and service contractors. This includes crafting contracts that may activate certain control categories, such as representations and covenants confirming that the counterpart is not, and will not become, a specified foreign entity.”

Morrison continues, “We’ve also dedicated significant effort to designing contracts that avoid triggering these categories, especially for clients with a more cautious approach. This involves removing affirmative licenses to prevent falling under licensing restrictions and adjusting clauses to ensure they are well within safe boundaries, providing greater certainty that these categories are not met.”

Additionally, the Troutman Pepper Locke partner notes that many companies have not previously needed to monitor debts and ownership details at this level of detail. Consequently, many are now “scrambling” to gather this information.

Hope in data centre development?

In a recent discussion with ESN Premium, Jason Abiecunas, business development manager at FlexGen, said:

“There is the potential that the data centre market is one of our larger market segments. It’s a significant driver of economic growth. It’s a significant driver of the next major wave of industrialisation. We see it as enduring, and we see it as significant.”

Morrison says that, perhaps crucially, to its relative sparing in the OBBBA, the storage industry has separated itself from the renewable energy industry, a “logical” decision, he notes.

The industry’s focus on providing energy security over being a renewable energy source has already had a bit of a ripple effect, with solar developers taking note of the messaging and others adapting it further.

BESS projects can help data centre developers manage power fluctuations and quality; the pairing makes logical sense. However, BESS being tied to data centre development is not necessarily a sure thing.

Morrison says, “I think people have not totally figured out yet what role battery storage is going to play with data centres. There are some intuitive use cases, particularly around pairing storage with intermittent generation, which is so important to a lot of the hyperscalers. But we’ve not seen that deployed at the same scale as we have other technologies for purposes of behind-the-meter delivery to data centres. So, that’s still early days.”

He continues, pointing out the risk as well: “The risk is that the load does not actually pan out the way people think it will, or that if it does, people are so focused on reliability that they just disregard non-conventional generation technologies altogether. So, there is a risk of either that boat not coming into port or missing that boat if other technologies gain an advantage that can’t be overcome.”

There are multiple unknowns for BESS and data centre development. As Thomas Cornell, CEO and President of Prevalon Energy, recently pointed out in a discussion with ESN Premium:

“I think everybody’s been following the existing process, but now the question is, are they going to declare an emergency?”

Cornell continued, “Then, the data centres are going to move to the front of the line, or some of these gas assets are being moved to the front. Especially now, the government has really hampered wind and solar. Most of the queues, if you look at them over the next five years, are flooded with wind and solar energy, mainly solar projects, and then gas is beyond that.”

“Now, you take solar out of the mix, and you cannot build gas generation fast enough. What are people left to do?”

In a situation like the one Cornell described, developers would find themselves in an even tougher spot, and have limited opportunities to pivot into other industries or niches.

Morrison explains, “If you’re just a general energy investor, then you probably just pivot to natural gas or data centres at that point. If you’re a battery storage developer, I think you’re focusing more on opportunities that are not as vulnerable to interconnection queue delays.”

“We have already seen a good bit of that in PJM and ISO New England, where existing interconnects are repurposed for ancillary services or what have you, and then focus on behind-the-meter applications,” he continues.

While a large number of projects are thought to be secure through Safe Harbouring, and onshoring the supply chain presents a potentially longer-term opportunity, creating domestic BESS products and adhering to FEOC restrictions remain a near-term issue that could become more significant.

Morrison says, “I think between the FEOC rules, the 45X credits and the domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act, what we’re seeing at the federal level is a unified market signal from both parties that domestic manufacturing is important, and it’s something that the federal government is investing in, regardless of who’s in power.”

“If you’re in the business of building the only thing that the two political parties can agree on, that’s a good business to be in, for sure.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-71.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:04.391137

According to a government report released on Sunday by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the decarbonisation plan will stimulate job creation across several sectors, including nuclear, renewable energy, carbon capture, and energy efficiency- Bloomberg first reported.

The report highlights that trades such as plumbing, carpentry, electrical work, and welding will experience significant demand growth as the country ramps up its clean energy infrastructure.

In the East of England, construction of the Sizewell C nuclear facility on the Suffolk coast is expected to generate around 10,000 jobs at peak construction.

Meanwhile, Scotland and the North East of England will see approximately 35,000 jobs supported by carbon capture and storage projects. London’s clean energy workforce could also more than double, with up to 25,000 people employed directly in the sector by the end of the decade.

A breakdown of the report

The report noted that the clean energy expansion will require a major skills upgrade to meet labour demands.

By 2030, the number of plumbers and carpenters will need to double compared to 2023 levels, while the number of welders must triple to support the planned growth.

The government has committed to increased funding for vocational training and technical education to bridge the skills gap.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized that the government’s priority is to ensure British workers benefit directly from the green jobs boom. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Miliband stated, “We will do everything we can to make sure that these jobs go to workers from Britain.” He added that the government aims to train about 20,000 people to prepare them for the new employment opportunities in clean energy industries.

“Where are the good jobs of the future going to come from? What’s the job my son or daughter can do in the future?” Miliband said. “This is the answer: clean energy jobs working on nuclear power stations, offshore wind, and carbon capture.”

What you should know

However, reports have raised concerns that the government’s projections may be overly optimistic, noting that the UK could face challenges in sourcing workers with the necessary expertise domestically.

Some reports warn that additional reliance on skilled labour from abroad could increase costs for employers and slow down project timelines.

Despite the skepticism, the Labour government maintains that its green transition plan will be a cornerstone of the UK’s economic renewal strategy, positioning clean energy as both an environmental and employment driver.

Earlier, Nairametrics reported that the British government had announced a record £3 billion investment in skills training, aimed at reducing the country’s dependence on foreign labour by equipping locals with industry-relevant skills.

The initiative is expected to create 120,000 training opportunities across high-demand sectors, including construction, engineering, health and social care, and digital.

The initiative is part of the UK’s broader goal to achieve a net-zero energy system by 2050, with significant progress targeted by 2030 through investments in nuclear power, offshore wind, and carbon capture technologies.",https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/United-States-1.png,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:42.812790

On Oct. 19, the government published a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

The government is aiming to galvanize industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations, setting clear workforce estimates for the first time.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how the government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70 percent in the mid-90s to around 30 percent currently. Recognizing trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

“Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs” said Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. ""The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen. Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.""

The government's clean energy mission has already galvanized over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23 percent more than the same occupations in other sectors.

“We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation” added Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden. “Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future, as part of our Plan for Change.”

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - Five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be supported by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new program to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation and wind turbine factories, alongside other roles in nuclear power stations.

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades.

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the 'energy skills passport', which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind and to new sectors such as the electricity grid.

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights.

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy.

This comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50 percent currently.

With at least one in six ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation and wind turbine factories.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 55,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

The lawsuits, filed in the court of federal claims and federal court in Washington state, seek monetary damages and reinstatement of the program.
The coalition includes 22 states and Washington DC, led by Democratic attorneys general challenging Trump’s energy and environmental policies.","Nearly two dozen states have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration after it cancelled a $7bn solar grant program designed to expand clean energy access for low-income communities.

The Solar for All program, managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), aimed to fund solar installations for disadvantaged households. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced its termination in August, calling it a “boondoggle”. The agency declined to comment on ongoing litigation.

California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said the cancellation violates federal obligations and would strip billions from renewable energy investments. “The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said. “In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.”

California will lose around $250m in congressionally approved funds, while Arizona will forfeit $156m. Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the move will affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide, including 11,000 in her state. She warned that energy bills could rise by 20%. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” she said.

The lawsuits, filed in the court of federal claims and federal court in Washington state, seek monetary damages and reinstatement of the program. They follow a separate legal challenge from solar companies and labor unions filed earlier this month.

The cancellation stems from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by Donald Trump in July, which eliminated the program’s funding source. The president has repeatedly rolled back support for renewable energy, describing solar and wind as unreliable and costly.

Mayes highlighted the impact on Arizona’s Hopi tribe, which was set to receive $25m to bring electricity to hundreds of homes using solar and battery systems.

The IEA’s Energy Policy Review of Mozambique was officially launched today alongside complementary IEA analysis, National Climate Resilience Assessment for Mozambique, during the 5th Energy Seminar of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) in Maputo. The Seminar is part of the CPLP Energy and Climate week, co-organised by the Lusophone Renewable Energy Association (ALER) and the Association of the Portuguese-Speaking Energy Regulators (RELOP).

IEA Deputy Executive Director Mary Burce Warlick launched both reports in the opening ceremony of the CPLP Seminar, which also included remarks from Ms. Marcelina Mataveia, National Energy Director at the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy of Mozambique. Speaking by video message, Ms Warlick said: “Mozambique is a country with tremendous energy potential. From vast natural gas reserves to abundant hydropower, solar and wind resources, the foundations are in place to build a modern, inclusive, and sustainable energy system. With the right partnerships, planning, and investment, Mozambique can turn its energy potential into lasting development gains.”

The IEA worked closely with the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy of Mozambique for the preparation of the Energy Policy Review, which benefitted from broad consultations with the key stakeholders across the energy sector, ranging from public bodies to development partners, private sector developers, academia, civil society and commercial banks. The review takes stock of progress in expanding electricity access and encourages continued efforts to strengthen governance, coordination, and data quality for the government to achieve its energy and development goals.

Over the past decade, Mozambique nearly doubled its electrification rate thanks to grid extensions and off-grid solutions. Yet, more than half of the population still lacked access to electricity in 2022, and access to clean cooking is critically low, with just 7% of the population using modern solutions. The report shows that mini-grids and standalone solar home systems will be key to enable least-cost electricity access in rural areas, but further efforts are needed to stimulate market development in these sectors, which remain dependant on public funding.

Through its Energy Transition Strategy (ETE), approved in 2023, Mozambique has set a long-term vision to achieve universal, affordable, and reliable access to modern energy by 2030. It aims to leverage Mozambique abundant energy resources – including hydropower, solar, wind, biomass, and some of the world’s largest natural gas reserves – to build a modern and inclusive energy system, accelerate industrialisation and move up the value chain of critical minerals.

However, implementation of the ETE faces constraints, including infrastructure and affordability challenges. Mozambique’s investment environment is hampered by a high cost of capital, restricting access to finance for projects and making it hard to close the country’s energy infrastructure gap. While Mozambique is already exporting LNG, major projects have been delayed, and the anticipated benefits have yet to materialise. The government has established a new Sovereign Wealth Fund to help manage the financial revenues generated from the country’s gas operations.

Moreover, Mozambique has developed a strong policy foundation for enhancing climate resilience and adaptation, including the National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy (NCCAMS) and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The National Climate Resilience Assessment for Mozambique highlights that further benefits could be achieved by developing a comprehensive adaptation plan for the energy sector, conducting detailed analyses of climate impacts on hydropower, and promoting coordinated actions through collaborative frameworks and capacity-building programmes.",https://iea.imgix.net/250e83dd-7e90-483f-a65d-f189274c1f96/AerialofskylineofMaputo_Mozambique_shutterstock_1458983672.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=902%2C0%2C2772%2C2772&w=1200,N,,2025-10-20 11:28:32.111394

There is an economic storm brewing across the state; Long Beach as a trade hub must also navigate the impacts of federal trade volatility.
This is why I am calling upon the Long Beach business community and every concerned stakeholder to stand up now for a balanced energy approach.","The current state of California’s energy policy landscape reflects the ongoing debate over how to best balance energy needs and preferences with resource reliability, evolving environmental protections and the economy’s vitality.

Business groups, labor organizations and communities across both the state and here locally in Long Beach are calling for a solution that prioritizes a thoughtful energy transition. There must be prioritization for an even-handed plan capable of respecting the real-world economic pressures faced by working families, businesses and industries.

In Long Beach, this crucial need is sewn into the very fabric of our communities. We are a proudly diverse, deeply progressive city complemented by the busiest, most robust port complex in North America, “America’s Coolest Airport” and some of the nation’s most innovative aerospace companies. While we are all dedicated to working towards a cleaner energy future, we are also deeply tied to logistics, manufacturing, the working communities and the small businesses that rely on affordable, reliable fuel and transportation.

Our values are being directly challenged by the state’s recent energy policies, and their unintended consequences. A gas excise tax increase on July 1, the newly expanded Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) mandates, and the pending closures of the Phillips 66 refinery in Wilmington and the Valero refinery in Benicia (which together account for over 17% of in-state fuel production) each promise unnecessary, self-inflicted economic hardships in our community. There is an economic storm brewing across the state; Long Beach as a trade hub must also navigate the impacts of federal trade volatility.

Regulations must be realistic

Trade through the Port of Long Beach supports nearly 2.7 million jobs nationwide, contributes $309 billion to GDP and generates $84 billion in tax revenue. In the five-county Southern California region, over 691,000 jobs are connected to port trade, construction, and tourism – or 1 out of every 17 jobs. As a sobering reminder of what is at stake, port and civic leaders emphasize that a 10% drop in cargo cost more than 100,000 jobs regionally.

Continuing to add fuel costs to our industries and partners already dealing with historically tight margins will be more than the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Our drayage trucks, freight operators and warehouse workers depend on diesel. Each incremental cent at the pump adds up fast.

Take for example, Ability TriModal, an award-winning transportation company that has specialized in trans-loading, consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, and retail delivery in Long Beach since 1947 and proud member of The Chamber since 1984.

Few companies embody the realities of California’s energy policy shifts more than they do. Having worked directly with the EPA and CARB since the 1980s, they’ve seen every iteration of environmental regulation come down the pipeline. What they will tell you is not that change is unwelcome, but that mandates too often arrive without consultation, scientific grounding or realistic timelines. The result is technology and regulation moving on two separate tracks: manufacturers can’t build fast enough, technicians can’t be trained fast enough and companies are left with equipment that is too expensive, too unreliable and too quickly obsolete.

It’s not that there is opposition to innovation; there is opposition to this mandate-first mentality that ignores on-the-ground realities and undermines the very spirit of American industry – the drive to continuously make things better. For businesses both in and beyond this industry, California’s current path risks sidelining progress by setting rules we cannot realistically follow.

Long Beach is a forward-thinking community capable of balancing industry growth and environmental sustainability. From the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, to the groundbreaking Clean Trucks Program, to investments into green infrastructure expansion, we have proven we are dedicated to working together to build a bridge to a cleaner future, but one our businesses are still able to walk across.

Young entrepreneurs and climate-considerate workers are looking for a path in the middle. They want to see job growth in logistics, clean manufacturing, port-adjacent green tech. What they don’t want is being forced to choose clean energy at the expense of local wages and commerce.

This is why I am calling upon the Long Beach business community and every concerned stakeholder to stand up now for a balanced energy approach. We must continue to invest in initiatives like port-side charging or hydrogen fueling infrastructure, advocate for stable trade policy, and ensure our workers and businesses have access to reliable, affordable energy. Our infrastructure, our industry, our communities are simply not prepared for the burdensome and unrealistic mandates set upon us by the state.

This is not a call to retreat from progressive environmental values; it is instead an embrace of a solution that balances our unique economic realities. That fact that there is debate in Sacramento represents our progress already. Legislators and regulators are listening. It is time that we speak up.",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LABJ-placeholder-logos-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:28:35.315144

This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance, uplift the American worker, protect the American industry, cherish American resources, and make America the most prosperous country on the face of the Earth.","President Donald Trump issued a Proclamation declaring the month of October as National Energy Dominance Month.

Trump was Monday’s KVML “Newsmaker of the Day”. Here are his words:

“From the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River to the Great Plains and beyond, for nearly 250 years, America has been endlessly sustained and enriched by our abundance of precious natural resources like oil, clean coal, minerals, and natural gas. This National Energy Dominance Month, my Administration proudly recommits to harnessing the liquid gold and minerals under our feet and bountiful resources in our waters, forests, and fields, achieving American energy dominance, and forging a future defined by three simple words: “Drill, baby, drill.”

During my first term in office, America became the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and the coal industry was coming back — after eight hard years of Obama’s War on Coal. Tragically, after the conclusion of my first term, the previous administration launched a war on American energy — reversing all of my historic first term actions, leading all 50 States to hit record-high gas prices. Meanwhile, the Green New Scam shuttered dozens of coal plants leaving our power grid vulnerable, halted mining productions, and shipped our energy jobs from Texas to Tehran, from the Midwest to Moscow, and from Baton Rouge to Beijing. As I have stated many times before, energy security is national security. My predecessor outrageously depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve — emboldening our enemies and making us reliant on foreign nations while subjecting the American people to sky-high energy prices here at home.

This period of national self-destruction ended on January 20, 2025. As the 47th President of the United States, my energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power. On my first day in office, I declared a National Energy Emergency to lower escalating energy prices. I signed an Executive Order to unleash American energy, which rolled back energy restrictions imposed by the previous administration. I established the National Energy Dominance Council to ensure the American energy industry maintains its global leadership in the decades to come. I also took action to revive America’s dominance in offshore critical minerals and resources, lift burdensome regulations on coal plants to ensure they can continue to run, launch the nuclear energy renaissance, and open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the largest drilling sites in the world. Every day, we are making good on our promise to restore the United States as a global energy superpower — and our work has only just begun. Now, under my Administration, our workers are drilling, mining, and producing like never before.

This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance, uplift the American worker, protect the American industry, cherish American resources, and make America the most prosperous country on the face of the Earth.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2025 as National Energy Dominance Month.”

Researchers are proposing an approach that will allow policymakers and technology developers to better align the values programmed into smart city technologies with the ethics of the people who will be interacting with them.

“Our work here lays out a blueprint for how we can both establish what an AI-driven technology’s values should be and actually program those values into the relevant AI systems,” says Veljko Dubljević, corresponding author of a paper on the work and Joseph D. Moore Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at North Carolina State University.

At issue are smart cities, a catch-all term that covers a variety of technological and administrative practices that have emerged in cities in recent decades. Examples include automated technologies that dispatch law enforcement when they detect possible gunfire, or technologies that use automated sensors to monitor pedestrian and auto traffic to control everything from street lights to traffic signals.

“These technologies can pose significant ethical questions,” says Dubljević, who is part of the Science, Technology & Society program at NC State.

“For example, if AI technology presumes it detected a gunshot and sends a SWAT team to a place of business, but the noise was actually something else, is that reasonable?” Dubljević asks. “Who decides to what extent people should be tracked or surveilled by smart city technologies? Which behaviors should mark someone out as an individual who should be under escalated surveillance? These are reasonable questions, and at the moment there is no agreed upon procedure for answering them. And there is definitely not a clear procedure for how we should train AI to answer these questions.”

To address this challenge, the researchers looked to something called the Agent Deed Consequence (ADC) model. The ADC model holds that people take three things into account when making a moral judgment: the agent, which is the character or intent of the person who is doing something; the deed, or what is being done; and the consequence, or the outcome that results from the deed.

In their paper, the researchers demonstrate that the ADC model can be used to not only capture how humans make value judgments and ethical decisions, but can do so in a way that can be programmed into an AI system. This is possible because the ADC model uses deontic logic, which is a type of imperative logic.

“It allows us to capture not only what is true, but what should be done,” says Daniel Shussett, first author of the paper and a postdoctoral researcher at NC State. “This is important because it drives action, and can be used by an AI system to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate orders or requests.”

“For example, if an AI system is tasked with managing traffic and an ambulance with flashing emergency lights approaches a traffic light, this may be a signal to the AI that the ambulance should have priority and alter traffic signals to help it travel quickly,” says Dubljević. “That would be a legitimate request. But if a random vehicle puts flashing lights on its roof in an attempt to get through traffic more quickly, that would be an illegitimate request and the AI should not give them a green light.

“With humans, it is possible to explain things in a way where people learn what should and shouldn’t be done, but that doesn’t work with computers. Instead, you have to be able to create a mathematical formula that represents the chain of reasoning. The ADC model allows us to create that formula.”

“These emerging smart city technologies are being adopted around the world, and the work we’ve done here suggests the ADC model can be used to address the full scope of ethical questions these technologies pose,” says Shussett. “The next step is to test a variety of scenarios across multiple technologies in simulations to ensure the model works in a consistent, predictable way. If it passes those tests, it would be ready for testing in real-world settings.”

Parental Rights A proposed constitutional amendment in Texas would, affirm “that parents are the primary decision makers for their children,” the ballot title says.

Colorado, Maine, New York, Texas, and Washington also have measures up for a vote this year. Seventeen of the 26 total measures will appear on Texans’ ballots.

Unlike in 2024, when access to reproductive care was put to voters in 10 states, no single issue dominates across the country. Some voters will, however, see propositions similar to those popular on 2024 ballots, including adding language to constitutionally limit the right to vote to citizens and initiatives to require voter ID. Below are some of the issues the measures address.

Redistricting

California’s Proposition 50 is a legislatively referred constitutional amendment that would allow use of a new congressional district map until 2030. The map is designed to favor Democratic candidates for the U.S. House. Drawing a new map was endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) after Texas Republicans, with the encouragement of President Donald Trump, began discussing — and subsequently passed — a new congressional map in their state that favors Republicans and is expected to flip five current Democratic seats. If Proposition 50 passes, five California congressional seats are expected to become either competitive for or easily winnable by Democratic candidates.

Congressional maps are usually only redrawn after release of the once-a-decade census results. Mid-cycle redraws, as Texas did, are rare. Proposition 50 would also require that, following the 2030 elections and thus the 2030 census, power to draw congressional lines would return to the state’s nonpartisan redistricting committee.

Voting

Voters in Texas will decide whether to amend their constitution to say that “persons who are not citizens of the United States” cannot vote in Texas. This proposed amendment is similar to what voters in eight states considered in 2024; all eight approved the language. Both state and federal law already limit voting to citizens only, and noncitizens voting in elections is extremely rare.

In Maine, voters — via one citizen-initiated question — will decide whether to amend state law to make several voting-related changes. Multiple of the changes relate to limiting absentee voting, like eliminating two days of absentee voting, banning prepaid potage on absentee ballot return envelopes, ending ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, and requiring voters to provide proof of photo ID before voting absentee. The measure would also require photo ID for in-person voting.

Maine saw its second-highest absentee voting levels in 2024 (after only the 2020 election, during the pandemic). Limiting access to by-mail voting is a focus of the Trump administration. The League of Women Voters has urged Maine citizens to vote no on the question.

Gun Laws

Question two on Maine’s ballot relates to firearm restrictions. The citizen-initiated measure asks voters whether state law should be amended to “allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger” to themselves or others.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) is against the measure. She argues gun laws already on the books allow law enforcement to take necessary steps to remove firearms from those who are a danger and that any removal process should be initiated by contacting law enforcement and not be left up to family members or friends to navigate the court procedures. Difficulties family members could encounter if they choose the court process, such as feelings of confusion or intimidation regarding what is required, might deter them from following through with getting the necessary help, she writes.

Parental Rights

A proposed constitutional amendment in Texas would, affirm “that parents are the primary decision makers for their children,” the ballot title says. The Texas Tribune described the amendment as codifying in the state constitution rights that are currently defined mostly in federal court cases.

Judicial Conduct

Another proposed Texas amendment would change the makeup of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, including by increasing the number of citizens on the commission who are selected by the governor from five to seven, which would give the governor the power to appoint a majority of the commission’s 13 members. The amendment would also alter how the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court selects the tribunals that review the commission’s recommendations for removal or retirement of a judge and restrict the commission’s ability to issue private reprimands in certain circumstances. Current Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) previously removed acting commissioners for their 2019 decision to reprimand a judge who was refusing to conduct same-sex marriages.

Environment

Texas’s ballot also includes a proposed amendment that would dedicate a portion of certain tax revenue to the Texas water fund and to provide for the allocation of that revenue. The proposed amendment comes as at least one estimate said a major drought could mean the state couldn’t meet its water supply needs as soon as 2030. If the amendment passes, funds could be used to repair aging infrastructure and develop new water sources.

A proposed amendment in New York would allow for the development of winter sports facilities on more than 300 acres of a sports complex in the Adirondack mountains, but would also require preserving more than 2,500 acres of land in the area.

Criminal Law

Texas’s Proposition 4 would make several changes to the state constitution’s provisions relating to certain criminal offenses — including capital murder, aggravated sexual assault, or indecency with a child — to deny the accused bail if the state shows “by a preponderance of the evidence” that bail is not sufficient to prevent the defendant’s “nonappearance” in court or ensure the safety of the community.

Taxes and State Investments

A majority of the ballot measures in Texas relate to taxes. Some of Texas’s measures involve a ban on capital gains taxes for individuals or estates, a tax exemption related to “border security infrastructure,” school tax exemptions for the elderly, and increased property tax exemptions that will allow Texas homeowners to pay lower taxes for public school funds.

A Colorado proposition would lower some citizens’ tax deduction limits in order to generate funds for Healthy School Meals for All Programs. A proposed amendment in Washington would allow a specific state fund to be invested in stocks. Currently, the state constitution forbids investment of public funds in private stocks, thus limiting state investments to less risky options like government bonds. The amendment had bipartisan support in the state legislature.

• • •

Most of the measures up for vote next month would amend states constitutions and were initiated by state legislators, who voted to put the measure up for public approval. Maine’s, however, are citizen-initiated legislative changes rather than constitutional amendments. The measures need a simple majority of the public vote to pass.

,Texas American Energy ,2025-10-20 12:21:57+00:00,Solar Power World,EG4 meets the moment in solar with budget-friendly off-grid products,Kelsey Misbrener,,,,,https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2025/10/eg4-meets-the-moment-in-solar-with-budget-friendly-off-grid-products/,"EG4 and its parent company Energy Access Innovations (EAI) were created in rural Sulphur Springs, Texas, by CEO James Showalter.
He and his team noticed many of the residential solar products on the market weren’t the best fit for its customer base.
Showalter’s DIY roots mean the products are designed with the off-grid solar customer front-of-mind.
The user-friendly elements of EG4’s products are another selling point for West Texas Solar.
“I know that they are continually adding new products, and I hope there’s compatibility with old products to new products.","Catching the solar industry’s attention sometimes means spending money on an enormous booth at RE+. Other times, word of mouth can bring a brand to the forefront without too much flashy marketing.

Hybrid inverter + battery storage manufacturer EG4 Electronics is one of those companies the residential solar industry can’t stop talking about right now — and the transformation from a modest, far-flung RE+ booth in 2024 to hefty square footage in the main exhibit hall in 2025 reflected that come-up.

“They weren’t really on my radar, and then I just kept hearing people ask about it, ask about it, ask about it. So then it makes you go, ‘OK, well, what is this?'” said Gage Mueller, senior energy consultant at Texas-based Solstice Solar.

EG4 and its parent company Energy Access Innovations (EAI) were created in rural Sulphur Springs, Texas, by CEO James Showalter. Showalter started his solar journey in the DIY community, installing a fully off-grid system on his family’s home in 2013. From there, he opened a long-tail solar installation company in West Texas. Ever the entrepreneur, he gave the company to one of his brothers to start a new endeavor — a solar product distribution company called Signature Solar that sold the products he wished he had access to at his installation firm.

Focusing on the DIY market meant fielding many questions from homeowners, so Signature established a call center with NABCEP-trained customer representatives.

“We were taking over 10,000 consultative phone calls a week with people building systems. The idea for an OEM new-generation storage manufacturer came within the first year,” Showalter said.

He and his team noticed many of the residential solar products on the market weren’t the best fit for its customer base. Many were tailored to the customers in the largest solar state of California — homeowners with relatively low energy demand, high energy prices and decent net-metering rates to sell power back to utilities (prior to NEM 3.0).

“When you define the problem by that market, it becomes irrelevant to the rest of the country, because the energy costs are much, much higher in California than the rest of the country, and people use less energy, so you end up with higher-priced hardware that isn’t designed to put out high power,” Showalter said.

So he set out to create a product that would work for a market like his hometown in Texas — high energy demand, lower but rising energy costs, and little to no incentive to export power to the grid.

Partnering with a Chinese OEM called LuxpowerTek, in 2020 Showalter launched EG4 — which stands for “energy generation for everyone” — to close that gap he saw in the market. EG4 makes hybrid inverters such as the FlexBOSS, the 18k and 12k, as well as wall-mounted batteries. Showalter’s DIY roots mean the products are designed with the off-grid solar customer front-of-mind.

“We’re an off-grid system that [was] designed to hook up to the grid. Most of the systems out there are grid-tied systems that they’re trying to go back and add off-grid functionality to,” he said. “Our inverter, for instance, can start a 5-ton air conditioner right out of the box. That’s not even a design protocol for most of the other battery ESS providers.”

Installer experience

EG4 isn’t the first to prioritize the off-grid or hybrid solar customer, but installers having issues with other manufacturers have found success with the company.

“The companies that I was using before, their service seemed to tank around the time EG4 was coming out, and EG4 service has been pretty spot-on,” said Rudy Wright, CEO of East Texas installer Wright-Way Solar Technologies.

The first generation of EG4’s products weren’t UL-rated or grid-interactive, and they also had quality issues, according to Wright and Landon Liles, VP of operations for West Texas Solar. But the installers say the company has addressed those problems in its current models.

“The RMA process is super simple on the very few issues that we have had with the inverters. But the batteries have been, I would say, foolproof,” Liles said.

Aside from reliable service, the biggest draw of EG4 has been the low prices.

“Their 14-kWh battery hit the market at one-third of the price-per-kWh of the one I was selling prior to that,” Wright said. “I was willing to sell American-made at a 20 to 30% premium. But by the time you’re at a 66% premium… I have to get off the boat of American-made and jump into China import.”

West Texas Solar has had nearly 100% battery attachment rates on solar jobs for the past two years, with customers wanting more backup power as utilities pivot away from export compensation. EG4’s larger, low-cost battery checked those boxes.

“We realized that grid-tied-only was not working out for them, and assuming that utilities are going to buy your power back is a wrong assumption,” Liles said. “We needed bigger battery banks that don’t cost an arm and a leg.”

Now, West Texas Solar is installing at least two EG4 outdoor-rated batteries on every job.

“Having it truly outdoor-rated allows us to take up a lot less space in the garage or on the walls, and we can put it under our ground mounts, or kind of get creative with our placement of the batteries,” Liles said.

The user-friendly elements of EG4’s products are another selling point for West Texas Solar. Homeowners can click a button for pre-loaded settings that meet their needs, including nighttime battery use or self-consumption.

“From the installation to the commissioning to the support in the design, it’s been good, and I hope it stays that way,” Liles said. “I know that they are continually adding new products, and I hope there’s compatibility with old products to new products. People want to add on to their systems — hopefully that all meshes well and it doesn’t get too software-heavy.”

2026 plans and FEOC

As the end of the 25D residential ITC approaches this year, budget-friendly solar products like EG4’s are only going to become more important.

“With the tax credit going away, with homeowners not wanting to rely on the grid anymore — now this is an affordable option, even without the tax credit,” said Mueller of Solstice Solar.

At the same time, more residential installers may turn to TPO financing structures to claim the 48E ITC — and will need to comply with new FEOC requirements limiting products from China and other countries.

EG4 is working on options for both categories of installers going into 2026.

“A lot of companies are going to raise the price for higher FEOC compliance, and they’re going to douse their 25D folks. We created a dual solution,” Showalter said.

Last summer, EG4 opened a 310,000-ft2 manufacturing facility in Commerce, Texas, to start assembling product in the United States. The company also acquired U.S. off-grid solar manufacturer OutBack Power to “combine OutBack’s legacy of engineering excellence with EAI’s global resources.”

In the fall, EG4 formed a supply partnership with LG Energy Solution to purchase 13.5 GWh of Michigan-made battery cells through 2030 that it will assemble into batteries at its Commerce facility for a “hyper-compliant” product, to be paired with its next-generation inverter. The company will still have Chinese batteries available for installers looking for cheaper options and not concerned with FEOC restrictions.

“We have a unified home EMS inverter and energy management platform, but we have a domestic content battery that’s rigorously compliant that we can bolt on, or we have a Chinese battery,” Showalter said.

Despite its humble DIY-focused beginnings, EG4 is becoming a recognizable name in solar during this time of slashed federal incentives and waning utility compensation.

“I think that’s what they initially started doing, was off-grid, and that’s what their passion was. And they still carry that with them, but have realized that they can compete with everybody else too,” Liles said.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EG4-texas-manufacturing-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:29:25.949984

The Friday Award pairs a former Faculty Fellow or Academic Leadership Fellow with an undergraduate student to work on a research project.","Doctoral student Sejal Mahendru grew up in New Delhi, India, where experiencing air pollution was a part of daily life. She recalls heavy smog, especially in the winter months, from industrial waste and agricultural crop burning to the north.

It was a tangible problem, something you could see and feel. Today, Mahendru, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in English and comparative literature with an interest in environmental humanities, is working on a far more invisible problem closer to her Carolina home.

PFAS is the abbreviation for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which are found in a variety of consumer products including nonstick cookware, fast-food containers, microwave popcorn bags, water-repellant clothing and firefighting foam. These human-created substances are often called “forever chemicals” and “legacy pollutants” because they are extremely difficult to break down over time and can be present in water, soil, air and food.

“The forever nature of PFAS is really scary. It’s nebulous. It’s everywhere,” Mahendru said.

Peer-reviewed studies have shown that high levels of PFAS exposure may lead to negative health effects, including increased risk for certain cancers, fertility issues and developmental delays, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

UNC-Chapel Hill is a leader in studying how to mitigate the impact of PFAS in North Carolina, with researchers from chemistry to public health working on the issue.

But Mahendru is part of a team of scholars, led by English faculty members Jordynn Jack and Courtney Rivard, who are examining the effects of PFAS exposure on people’s lives via a humanities lens. The team is gathering oral histories from residents in Pittsboro, North Carolina — Chapel Hill’s southern neighbor — where PFAS has been identified in some drinking water.

Different personal and professional experiences led Jack and Rivard, both leaders in the field of rhetoric, to team up to explore the impact of PFAS.

Jack grew up in Chatham, Ontario, Canada, and became interested in how community members there were dealing with water quality issues in their rural area after the installation of wind turbines.

During the pandemic, Rivard and her family discovered a new passion: exploring the Haw River by canoe. She also began reading news stories about some PFAS being found in the Haw River, which is Pittsboro’s drinking water source. The Haw is part of the Cape Fear River Basin, which extends into 26 counties in North Carolina. The Cape Fear River flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

The duo also realized the value of joining strengths through their respective English research labs — Jack co-directs the Health and Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Venue for Exploration Lab, also known as the HHIVE Lab, and Rivard directs the Digital Literacy and Communications Lab or DLC Lab.

Their resulting project is Forever Chemicals: A Story Archive in North Carolina, where they will develop a digital platform for sharing stories and valuable resources for people living with PFAS exposure. In the pilot phase of the project, the team has conducted and transcribed five oral histories, with a goal of gathering 15-20 interviews before creating a public-facing website. The oral histories are being stored in University Libraries’ Carolina Digital Repository and will eventually become part of the Southern Oral History Program. SOHP’s unofficial motto is “You don’t have to be famous for your life to be history.”

What can humanistic research methods bring to this multi-faceted problem?

“We’re really interested in hearing how people are making sense of this complicated issue through community-engaged research,” Rivard said. “Humanities also sits with that complexity instead of trying to get away from it or simplify it.”

Jack said that the Forever Chemicals team is also exploring how people are digesting information about PFAS contamination and its impacts on their health. Where do they go for information, and who do they trust? The EPA? Local government? News outlets?

“We are using our knowledge as scholars who study language and who are comfortable dwelling in the in-between to examine how people are relating to the scientific information they are receiving,” Jack said. “Many of our sources have been tested and are aware of their PFAS blood levels, but they are trying to understand that in the context of their lives.”

“It has been powerful to bear witness to people’s stories, but there’s a general frustration about what to do,” added Rivard, who is hoping that their project can help inform both scientists and policymakers. “The truth is there’s very little guidance for medical providers at the moment. And so that frustration is real.”

Strengths of a collaborative team

The English professors have built a team of creative undergraduate and graduate student scholars across disciplines.

Forever Chemicals project members have been reaching out to local advocacy groups like the Haw River Assembly and have published a Facebook page to try to solicit more interview sources.

In 2024, the team received two College awards to support the project.

Jack, Rivard and Mahendru received an Arts and Humanities Research grant, co-funded by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and the Institute for the Arts and Humanities. Mahendru has been working to ensure that the project adheres to best practices for environmental justice issues.

Tara Hinton ’25 of Sylva, North Carolina, was a part of the team as an undergraduate. She graduated last May with a major in environmental studies and a minor in statistics and analytics. She was also an intern with the SOHP.

Rivard and Hinton received a William C. Friday Arts and Humanities Research Award from the IAH. The Friday Award pairs a former Faculty Fellow or Academic Leadership Fellow with an undergraduate student to work on a research project.

Hinton, who brought strengths in conducting oral histories across the lifespan, worked on transcribing the interviews and also developing metadata — learning how to organize the audio and transcripts in an ethical and easily accessible way for future researchers. She said she loved the seamless blending of the humanities and the sciences through this project.

“One of the things that we are also learning is that people are turning this exposure to PFAS into a sense of agency — they’ve started environmental activism groups and have been advocating for their health in really important ways,” Hinton said.

The project received early support from the Arts and Humanities Grant Studio, an initiative based in the College that supports scholarly activity among humanists and humanistic social scientists at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Mariah Marsden, who today is the studio’s grants development manager, was a postdoctoral fellow when she began working on the Forever Chemicals project. She sat in on weekly team meetings, supported grant development proposals and helped with project management tasks.

“Having that kind of sustained attention was important to me,” said Marsden, a folklorist who grew up in the Ozarks in Missouri. “We have an engaging set of academic and community collaborators who work really well together. Artists and humanists ask really interesting, robust, meaningful research questions. And there’s something very satisfying about being a part of this project from the ground up and seeing it grow.”

Mahendru said the opportunity to work on a local project with possibly a larger statewide impact has been especially meaningful.

“When it comes to the environment, there are conversations about what you should be focusing on,” Mahendru said. “There’s an argument to be made for global — our environment connects us all. But being immersed in a local community is important to help make sense of that larger narrative.”

Courtney Rivard was named a Thorp Faculty Engaged Scholar in fall 2025.

YAHD SIGNS AND BUMPAH STICKAHS SENATE SPECIAL — State Rep. Rodney Elliot will run for the Senate seat previously held by late state Sen. Edward Kennedy.","BANK ON IT — While we were focused on the nascent Senate race, the latest Federal Election Commission filing deadline came and went.

THE SENATE SHOWDOWN — Sen. Ed Markey posted one of his biggest quarters this cycle, raising $755,741 from July through September as reports of a potential primary challenge ramped up. That’s more than twice Moulton’s $300,279 haul in the third quarter.

Markey also ended September with $2,662,200 on hand, more than Moulton’s $2,125,110.

But Moulton has raised another $500,000 since announcing his Senate bid, his campaign announced over the weekend (We won’t be able to check the totals until the fourth quarter reporters are out early next year.).

HIGHS AND LOWS — Markey raised the most of any member of the delegation, but Rep. Jake Auchincloss is sitting on a lot more money than everyone else. He ended the three-month period with more than $6.4 million in the bank. Elizabeth Warren had the next most cash on hand (just under $4 million). Rep. Stephen Lynch raised the least of any incumbent, with just $60,617. Meanwhile …

THE CHALLENGERS — … his challenger, Patrick Roath, an attorney from Jamaica Plain, pulled in about $143,000. Lynch still has more money in the bank ($1,056,625 to Roath’s $261,369).

Jeromie Whalen, the former Northampton teacher who is running against Rep. Richard Neal, raised $55,394 since getting in the race in August and ended the period with $15,743 in the bank. Neal had a significant advantage there, raising $216,461 and ending the quarter with $3,973,431 in his campaign coffers.

GOOD MONDAY MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS. In other fundraising news …

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Dan Koh, a former Biden White House official and longtime aide to former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, raised more than $800,000 in the first 24 hours of his congressional campaign launch, an amount he says is the largest first-day haul for any Democratic campaign this cycle.

That includes $50,000 of his own cash Koh is putting into the race. That money (which Koh says is a donation, not a loan) will go toward covering health care premiums for campaign staff.

“I know how hard it is to be a staffer, and I know how hard it is to work on a campaign. And on top of that, I don’t want my staff to be worried about how they’re going to pay their medical bills when they get sick,” Koh told Playbook.

Koh said he was “incredibly humbled” by the early fundraising haul. “I’m just grateful to the hard-working people who supported my campaign because they want a representative who will fight for working people, protect democracy and make life more affordable,” he said.

Koh raised some serious cash during his previous run for Congress in Massachusetts’ Third District, though his campaign also earned headlines for how much of that money was flowing from donors outside the district. Koh ended up coming in a close second in that race to Rep. Lori Trahan. His home in Andover ended up in the Sixth District after lawmakers drew new congressional maps in 2021.

YAHD SIGNS AND BUMPAH STICKAHS

SENATE SPECIAL — State Rep. Rodney Elliot will run for the Senate seat previously held by late state Sen. Edward Kennedy.

“This announcement comes with heartfelt deference to both Senator Kennedy and his family upon his passing,” Elliott said in announcing his bid for the seat that covers Lowell, Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell and Tyngsboro. “As a member of the House of Representatives and previously as a City Councilor, I had the distinct honor of working closely with Senator Kennedy, and have long respected his dedication and passion for serving both Lowell and the First Middlesex District.”

The Senate has yet to officially set the date for the special election to fill the seat Kennedy held until his death earlier this month.

MONEY WARS — Rep. Seth Moulton’s announcement that he won’t take money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (commonly known as AIPAC), isn’t sitting well with the organization. AIPAC took aim at Moulton in a fundraising missive last week, accusing Moulton of “capitulating to extremes rather than standing on conviction.”

DATELINE BEACON HILL

— Massachusetts gambling regulators look to rein in VIP programs by sports betting apps by Patrick Madden, WBUR: “The Massachusetts Gaming Commission is eyeing regulations for VIP programs used by online sports betting companies that offer perks to frequent bettors. VIP or loyalty programs at companies like DraftKings and FanDuel have come under increasing scrutiny over concerns they target gamblers who are losing money and encourage them to keep playing by rewarding them with trips, sports tickets or bet credits.”

— Education council releases draft of new state graduation standard after overturn of MCAS by Grace Zokovitch, Boston Herald: “Proposed regulations for a new graduation standard could see students across Massachusetts taking “end of course assessments” designed and administered by the state, according to a new draft released nearly a year after voters overturned the statewide MCAS testing graduation requirement. The preliminary draft released by state education officials lays out what standards Massachusetts high school students may be required to meet to graduate, replacing the former MCAS standardized testing requirement.”

IN ALIGNMENT — Massachusetts Republican gubernatorial hopeful Brian Shortsleeve has plenty of criticism for Gov. Maura Healey. But there’s one policy area where Shortsleeve and Healey overlap (at least a little): housing.

Shortsleeve wants to free up state-owned land for housing development in an effort to address the state’s housing crisis, he said during an interview on WCVB’s “On the Record” that aired Sunday.

“The state owns 100,000 acres of land around metro Boston in areas where the community would be happy to have you build,” he said, pointing to a program then-Gov. Charlie Baker launched in 2015.

If that sounds familiar, it’s because Healey made a similar move this summer. Her administration opened up 450 acres of state-owned land to developers who claim it could mean up to 3,500 new homes in the area of a former hospital campus, an abandoned school and an old state prison.

FROM THE HUB

DRAWING A CROWD — Boston’s “No Kings” protest caught social media attention for the aerial view of its crowd.

But for #mapoli watchers, it was also the first time Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Seth Moulton took the stage at the same event since Moulton announced he would challenge Markey for his Senate seat.

Markey appeared, draped in a transgender flag (a gift from a transgender high school student who attended the event, according to Markey’s campaign), a not-so-subtle reminder of comments Moulton made about transgender athletes to The New York Times in the wake of the 2024 election.

Some in the crowd still took issue with those remarks. Moulton’s speech was greeted with some booing, “and expletives from some rallygoers,” per MassLive. More on the protests in Quincy, Hyannis, Worcester, the Berkshires and the South Coast.

The Race for City Hall

— Incorrect email address led to New Bedford City Council candidate’s tardy campaign filing by Frank Mulligan, The Standard-Times: “City Council candidate Christopher Cotter has filed a required campaign financial document with the state that had been due last month, a lapse he had been warned could subject him to $25-per-day fines. However, he said his lack of response to the warnings was unintentional. Cotter stated in an Oct. 16 communication to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance that the lapse had been due to an incorrect email address.”

— Attleboro mayoral write-in candidate incorrectly claims police charge against him is a rumor by Rhianwen Watkins, The Sun Chronicle: “Write-in mayoral candidate John Robinson is claiming a news article published last week in The Sun Chronicle about him being charged with threatening to assault a school committee member was based on rumor and that no formal charges have been filed against him. The claim was debunked by Police Chief Kyle Heagney. Heagney confirmed with The Sun Chronicle Sunday that a charge has indeed been filed against Robinson in Attleboro District Court and that Robinson will be summonsed at a date to be determined by the court.”

WHAT'S ON CAMPBELL'S DOCKET

— AGs sue Trump EPA over solar energy program by Christian M. Wade, The Eagle-Tribune: “Attorney General Andrea Campbell has joined about two dozen other Democrats in suing the Trump administration over its decision to pull the plug on a $7 billion solar energy program for low-income households. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, alleges that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violated federal law and the Administrative Procedures Act when it terminated the Solar for All program, approved by Congress in 2023 as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

— Feds freeze funding for Cape Cod’s aging bridges due to government shutdown by Tonya Alanez, The Boston Globe: “Hundreds of millions in federal funding to help pay for the replacement of two aging bridges that carry traffic on and off Cape Cod suddenly appears to be in flux. The Trump administration last week announced a pause in $11 billion in US Army Corps of Engineers projects in Democratic cities, including Boston, due to the government shutdown. Governor Maura Healey and other Massachusetts lawmakers immediately expressed concern about the federal money, $350 million for the Sagamore Bridge and $250 million for the Bourne Bridge, which was earmarked in the spring of 2024 for the replacement projects.”

FROM THE DELEGATION

— Neal: It’s up to Trump, and the pressure of rising health insurance costs, to end the shutdown by Jim Kinney, The Springfield Republican: “Democrats are firm in their resolve to protect tax credits in the Affordable Care Act as the government shutdown heads toward its fourth week. U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal said higher bills for health insurance — costs the tax credits are meant to counteract for working Americans making too much money for Medicaid —that will end the impasse.”

THE LOCAL ANGLE

— Tens of thousands of Massachusetts federal workers face uncertainty amid government shutdown by Anjali Huynh, Katie Johnston, Laura Crimaldi and Jason Laughlin, The Boston Globe: “As congressional Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a standoff to reopen the government, federal workers in Massachusetts are facing chaos and confusion over whether they will get paid, or have jobs to return to if they are furloughed. More than half of Massachusetts’ estimated 46,000 federal employees — about 25,000 — have faced furloughs or are working without pay because of the shutdown, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, a union of federal workers. That number is part of a bleak national picture, in which federal workers say they’re acutely feeling the shutdown’s effects as many have now missed paychecks since the shutdown began Oct. 1.”

— Quincy ordered to pay $16 million to retirement pension fund. It could raise taxes by Peter Blandino, The Patriot Ledger: “The expected tax hike for Quincy property owners next year may be higher than previously anticipated. The $456 million fiscal 2026 budget is an 8.6% increase over the previous year, largely due to an expected $20 million jump in debt service tied to the city’s 2021 pension obligation bond. Debt service makes up almost 20% of the city’s budget. The bond is essentially a fixed-rate $475 million loan Quincy took out to fund the pensions of retired city workers fully by 2040, as mandated by the state. But Quincy also has another new $16 million bill to pay. The money is due to be paid into Quincy’s retirement system. The budget, proposed by Mayor Tom Koch and passed unanimously by city council, allocates nothing for it.”

DOE told POLITICO’s E&E News on Friday that it canceled the five grants during the second week of October. The cuts appear to be the first that DOE has confirmed from a list of targeted projects circulating among lobbyists. Until now, it was unclear if DOE planned to move forward with scrapping any of the more than $200 billion in awards on the list.

The $700 million covers grants that the Biden administration awarded to battery companies Ascend Elements, American Battery Technology Co., Anovion and ICL Specialty Products, as well as a glass manufacturer LuxWall, according to DOE.

The projects “had missed milestones, and it was determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement. He did not specify the milestones that DOE says the projects missed.

The cancellations are some of the largest to date of advanced battery manufacturing projects, affecting plans to build landmark plants in red states like Kentucky and Missouri. That distinguishes them from DOE’s initial tranche of $7.56 billion in terminations, which mainly affected projects in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

Those earlier cancellations included less than $175 million in funding cuts from DOE’s Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office (MESC) . The newly canceled funding totals approximately $718 million from the same office, affecting initiatives to manufacture components for electric vehicles and grid batteries.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and other Trump administration officials have been critical of federal funding of electric vehicles and renewables, which often work in tandem with batteries.

Wright has been leading a broad review of projects, following criteria outlined in a May memo. He defended funding cuts this month, saying that projects “have cancellation clauses.”

“If they’re not in the interest of the taxpayers, if they’re not a good expenditure of the money, you always have the ability to cancel these projects,” he said.

Democrats charge that DOE’s actions are illegal and will hurt the economy and slash jobs. Last week, 37 Democratic and independent senators said in a letter to Wright that “the illegality of your cancellations is the only thing as indisputable as the harm your cancellations will wreak.”

The department “must expend these funds and faithfully execute the law, including many programs that have strict requirements for the timing of fund expenditure, purposes, and contractual expectations,” the lawmakers said.

From Alabama to Michigan

The nixed grants affect projects backed by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

The $197.3 million award to ICL Specialty Products was slated to help build a plant in St. Louis producing 30,000 metric tons annually of lithium-ion phosphate powder for the battery industry. The company did not respond to request for comment but said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that it was “reviewing DOE’s announcement and the implications thereof.”

When the project was announced, ICL projected it would create 120 permanent positions and more than 800 construction jobs.

The largest canceled award — $316 million to Ascend Elements — was intended to support the manufacture of components from recycled electric vehicle batteries at a planned $1 billion plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The battery components would compete with supply that now comes primarily from China, the company said.

“The DOE’s decision regarding the grant doesn’t change our trajectory. We’re moving forward,” Linh Austin, president and CEO of the company, said last Thursday to E&E News.

“Our funding path is diversified well beyond DOE. We are replacing the remaining unused portion of the DOE grant with a mix of other sources of funding available to the company including equity, project finance, municipal bonds, and other forms of debt.”

According to the Massachusetts-based company, $206 million of the DOE award had been disbursed, so the cancellation would affect the roughly remaining $100 million.

The $57.7 million grant to American Battery Technology Co. was meant to support construction of a Nevada plant to produce lithium hydroxide for batteries.

The company said it received a notice from DOE on Oct. 9 about the axed funding, which it plans to appeal, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said there was roughly $52 million remaining to be disbursed from DOE, although the company said it has raised the same amount in public markets.

“Regardless of the outcome of the appeal process, the Company intends to move forward with the project without impact to timeline or scope,” the filing said. The filing added that Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council supported the project as a priority, and the administration has selected it for expedited permitting.

“All evidence demonstrates that this critical minerals project aligns with the administration’s mission and key priorities,” said American Battery Technology Co. CEO Ryan Melsert in an email

Melsert also told POLITICO on Friday that he was puzzled by DOE’s action, considering the administration’s earlier support of the project.

“Sometimes different agencies don’t communicate with each other, and we want to make sure this is really the decision of the administration,” Melsert said.

The $117 million award to Anovion was intended to support production of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion battery anodes, including through construction of a large plant in Alabama. Anovion did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.

LuxWall planned to use its $31.7 million DOE grant for construction of an advanced glass factory at the site of an old coal plant in Detroit. In announcing the funding in 2023, the Biden administration said the company’s products would support energy efficient windows that could help slash building emissions.

LuxWall said Saturday that it plans to appeal DOE’s decision to nix the grant.

It’s unclear if DOE intends to move forward with other cancellations on the $200 billion list. After the announcement of $7.56 billion in funding cuts, Wright told CNN there would be “many more” cancellations this fall.

The circulating list has angered Democrats and prompted several Republicans to pressure DOE to save projects in their states.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), for example, has said that funding for a “blue” hydrogen project in Appalachia that would use natural gas and carbon capture should not be eliminated. To date, DOE has canceled more than $2 billion in funding for two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast focused on producing the fuel with renewables.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/54/b5/fd4096d24086959c32b60918322a/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2239622919,N,,2025-10-20 09:03:30.467511

Indiana already has customer generation and, in fact, industrial customers in Indiana generate hundreds of megawatts of their own power to support their operations.
These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.","Frustration over utility rates and concerns about the impact of new businesses locating in Indiana have driven discussions about Indiana’s energy policy to an unprecedented but justified level of intensity in recent months.

It is not hard to understand why. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to our daily lives. It is also critical to the state’s manufacturing and industrial sectors, which currently account for 26% of the state GDP, a larger share than any other state.

Though it is easy to understand why energy anxiety has hit new levels, it is a little harder to pinpoint, exactly why. It is a long and complex story. Suffice to say that economic incentives to support utility investment, the necessary process of retiring aging power plants and building replacement generation, inflationary pressures, changing customer demand, and a litany of other factors have all played a role in bringing us to this point. The interplay of these factors help explain why the process of creating balance between customers and utilities — which is the ultimate goal of the regulatory process — is difficult.

Unfortunately, while Indiana and some very dedicated policymakers and stakeholders have tried very hard to find the right balance between those pressures and their impact on customers, we haven’t gotten the mix quite right.

Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

At this historic juncture, with a need to expand electric capacity on a scale the likes of which this country has not seen since the 1940s and 50s, we now have two broad paths open to us. One is to keep doing what we have been doing. The other is to try new approaches to adjust the balance. Understanding the story of how we got here is important, not to lay blame, but to focus on the essential question: “Which path do choose?” If we want reliable and affordable power as well as economic prosperity and development, we cannot continue along our current trajectory.

But if we choose a different path, what does that look like?

One step is to establish better support for customer investment in the energy resources which serve them. Indiana already has customer generation and, in fact, industrial customers in Indiana generate hundreds of megawatts of their own power to support their operations. But more could be done to balance the rights of customers and the interests of utilities. Expanded options for ownership and operational models for customer generation, actively supporting voluntary partnerships between utilities and customers to develop generation, and removing geographic and economic constraints on generation are all positive steps that could expand private investment in energy resources and reduce the need for costly new utility construction at public expense.

We also need to re-evaluate the incentives currently provided to utilities. In the past, Indiana has encouraged infrastructure investment by providing financial incentives for cost recovery. But a sustained cycle of incentivized capital investment by utilities will continue to drive utility rates higher. In that regard, Gov. Mike Braun has suggested we need to be more “attentive” to the investments utilities make.

One approach would be to revisit prior legislation to add stronger ratepayer protections. Utilities should be required to provide better justification for investments which receive automatic rate recovery; to demonstrate more than ordinary business risk before recovering cost overruns from customers; and adjust their profit margins to reflect the reduced risk arising from pre-approved investments. These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.

Indiana has many advantages as we head into the future. Our location at the Crossroads of America means we have the highways, the pipelines, the transmission facilities and other resources to propel ourselves forward.

McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself.","Monday marks the start of early voting in Texas' Nov. 4 general election. The only statewide contests this year are ballot propositions to amend the state constitution – 17 of them, to be exact.

More than half the constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall deal with taxation, while others pertain to bail practices, dementia research and the state’s water supply.

Arguably, the most significant measures would raise homestead exemptions. They determine how much of a home's property value can be taxed to pay for public schools.

Proposition 13 would lift the homestead exemption for all Texas homeowners from $100,000 to $140,000.

""Now that will save all those 5.7 million homeowners $484 per year,"" said Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt of Houston, author of the measure. ""Once the voters approve of a homestead exemption for schools, it follows you, no matter where you go. That $140,000 exemption means it’s whatever your primary homestead is, and it doesn’t matter if it’s year one or year 50, that’s going to be there. So that’s a substantial lifetime benefit.""

Bettencourt is also the author of Proposition 11, which would lift the additional homestead exemption for homeowners who are over age 65 or disabled from $10,000 to $60,000. In other words, if both Propositions 11 and 13 pass, those homeowners would have a homestead exemption of $200,000.

""Now you may ask, ‘Why do more for over-65 and disabled homeowners?'"" Bettencourt said. ""They’re generally on fixed income, and they need the most help staying in their home. And in the case of seniors, you can’t argue that they already paid a lifetime of taxes and probably don’t have any current students in the public education system.""

The combined benefits, and burdens, of tax breaks

Taken together with amendments to reduce property taxes passed in earlier elections, maintaining these reductions will cost the state roughly $51 billion.

“A lot of those have been funded out of surplus money, and surplus money is one-time revenue,"" said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""It’s not recurring revenue. So, when the surplus ends, you have to find another way to finance these reductions.""

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes, through a process called ""compression."" But unlike the homestead exemptions, the compressions would not be written into the constitution.

""There’s a big difference between the homestead exemptions, which are constitutionally passed and so guaranteed forever, but the compressions can be taken away just like that,"" Diamond said, snapping his fingers. ""Those are not protected.""

And that could lead to deep cuts in public education funding in lean budget years, much as Texas saw 20 years ago.

Some of the other tax measures are highly targeted. Proposition 7 would provide a full or partial homestead exemption to the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a disease or medical condition related to their service. Proposition 17 would provide property tax relief for homeowners whose property has been affected by the installation or construction of border security infrastructure along the Mexican border.

Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire. That's another of Bettencourt's measures.

""And so we decided, fine, we’ll give them the same coverage that we do for tornadoes and hurricanes,"" Bettencourt said. “Because if your home’s burned down, you shouldn’t have to pay for all the whole full value.""

University of Houston economist Steven Craig said all those exemptions add up.

""Our heart can go out to all kinds of people, and then the question is, ‘Is this the way to help them, or is there a better way to help them?'"" Craig said. ""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""

Then there are a series of measures that would ban the state from collecting certain kinds of taxes altogether. Proposition 2 would ban capital gains taxes. Proposition 6 would ban taxes on securities transactions. That's ahead of Texas establishing its own stock exchange. And Proposition 8 would ban inheritance taxes.

Texas doesn't collect any of these at present, but Diamond said ruling them out limits the state's options when revenues from other sources fall.

""Sales taxes, I could definitely see those flattening out as the consumers' resilience finally fades,"" Diamond said, ""and then federal transfers almost certainly are going to fall and could fall significantly. That is a huge chunk of the Texas budget.""

Felony bail reform

At least three ballot measures that don't relate to taxation have potentially widespread ramifications for the state. Take Proposition 3, which would amend the constitution to allow judges to deny bail to people charged with certain felonies. Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman of Houston has been trying to get this passed since 2019.

""A judge would have to determine that either the person was going to be a threat in some way to the safety of the community or to law enforcement and/or a likelihood that the person would not return to court,"" Huffman said.

The amendment would apply only to the most serious offenses – capital murder, murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and continuous human trafficking.

""This doesn’t take away any of the other rights that they would have for a trial, for the state to have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Huffman said. ""It’s just reserved for those that would be held pending trial. And I will say that many states have this exact same type of system, and the federal system operates this way for violent offenders.""

Prop 3 would affect a relatively small number of cases in the Texas justice system, about 40,000 out of more than 800,000 arrests made in Texas every year. That's according to Nick Hudson, senior manager of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of Texas. But Hudson said he has serious concerns that the measure would worsen overcrowding in Texas jails.

""I think this is very likely to pass. Our focus has been on trying to mitigate the harm it will cause,"" Hudson said. “We, along with many other people and many House and Senate negotiators, worked to ensure that there was access to lawyers baked into this proposal to blunt some of the potential negative impacts. We are happy to see that provision in, but we are really concerned that this will accelerate pretrial detention.""

Hudson argued that the measure could wind up violating one of the most basic rights of the accused.

""They have not been convicted,"" Hudson said. ""They are presumed innocent [until proven guilty], waiting for trial behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of about $1.2 billion a year.""

Investments in water infrastructure and dementia prevention

One ballot measure with a similar price tag, but less controversial, is Proposition 4. This amendment would dedicate up to $1 billion per year from existing state sales tax revenue to the Texas Water Fund for the next 20 years. The money would be used to fix some of the state's most pressing water infrastructure needs.

Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation, estimated the state's total needs for new water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as to replace aging infrastructure, at $150 billion, far above the maximum of $20 billion that Prop 4 would provide.

""Is it enough? No, it’s not enough to meet everything,"" Schlessinger said. ""Is it a significant move towards funding water infrastructure in Texas? Yes, significantly so.""

Schlessinger said the total amount of money the amendment would commit is less significant than the fact that the amendment provides for a dedicated and ongoing source of funds – allowing the state to better plan for long-term needs, like combatting droughts worsening in the face of climate change.

RELATED: Mayor Whitmire considers sending Houston water to West Texas – despite forecasted shortfall

Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at the public policy think tank Texas 2036, said Houston and other major cities have a lot riding on the passage of Prop 4.

""First, they need to expand and diversify their water supply portfolio for a dynamic, growing region,"" Mazur said. ""And second, there’s also this issue of aging, deteriorating, leaking water systems within the Houston metropolitan area that really need to be resolved sometime soon. These are systems that annoy everyday families and businesses through inadequate or leaking service, causing boil water notices or even service interruptions.""

Then there's Proposition 14, which would create a state institute for fighting dementia, formally the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT), similar to one Texas has already established to target cancer (CPRIT). The amendment would provide an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue to a fund dedicated to finding medical breakthroughs, cures, and prevention.

""It would be a breakthrough,"" said Ashley McPhail, chief external affairs and administration officer at the Texas Medical Center. ""It really would make a huge difference in sort of the path and trajectory that we are on for dementia and other related diseases within this space. If you look across funding, this would be sort of the second-largest funding for something like this, for brain health outside of the [National Institutes of Health] in the United States.""

McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself. It could lure hundreds of researchers to the state and spark the creation of dozens of companies dedicated to fighting Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, much as CPRIT has done already with cancer research. And that doesn't even touch the savings in residents' medical bills.

""Currently, over 400,000 Texans are living with Alzheimer’s, which costs families over $20 billion per year,"" McPhail said. ""Texas ranks third in the nation for the number of Alzheimer’s cases and second in the number of Alzheimer’s deaths. So, the need here in Texas is also very acute and specific from that side, and I would say it’s a $3.9 billion cost for Alzheimer’s to the Texas Medicaid program every year.""",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/25164942/Photo-of-voting-sign.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:10:51.569500

In 2022, Congress designated $7 billion to the EPA for promoting greenhouse gas reductions in disadvantaged communities. EPA created the “Solar for All Program” to distribute the funds nationwide, and California received $250 million.

However, the EPA in August announced that it would be cancelling the Solar for All Program. Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the EPA, said in a post to X that Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminated the program.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, in an announcement Thursday, said that clawing back the funds already granted for the Solar for All Program is unlawful since the Big Beautiful Bill states that only unobligated funds were taken away.

“The EPA had no legal right to terminate this congressionally approved program or rescind funds that have already been obligated to the states,” Bonta said in a virtual briefing.

California has joined two separate lawsuits, one filed in the Court of Federal Claims and one in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Washington.

“With these lawsuits, we’re asking the Court of Federal Claims to rule that the Trump EPA breached its contract with California and award us and the other states money damages,” Bonta said. “We’re also asking the District Court to declare that the Trump EPA termination of the Solar for All Program is unlawful, and to require EPA to reinstate the Solar for All Program.”

Rolling back the $250 million, Bonta said, will cost Californians more money since the California Public Utilities Commission will no longer be able to construct the more than 600 renewable energy facilities it had planned on that would have provided lower-cost solar energy.

Utilities in the Bay Area, including the Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the East Bay Municipal Utility District and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, would have been able to offer discounted rates for low- and middle-income families using solar energy.

So it’s little surprise that Energy Secretary Chris Wright chose the conservative academic to help write a government-backed report — released in July — that called into question the severity of global warming. Wright himself has disputed the risks of climate change, and the five authors he handpicked to write the report align with that perspective.

But a review by POLITICO’s E&E News has found another common thread.

Four of the five authors that Wright selected to write the July report have spoken out against the endangerment finding, a 2009 EPA decision that underpins many federal climate regulations. That includes Koonin, who in February urged the administration to begin the process of rolling back the endangerment finding “as soon as possible.”

The criticism from Koonin and his co-authors is significant because the report they co-wrote is being used as evidence by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to eliminate the endangerment finding, which Zeldin once called the “holy grail” of climate science. EPA’s plan to undo the endangerment finding cites the Wright climate report no less than 16 times, E&E News has found.

Climate scientists, environmental groups and Democrats have seized on the revelation and said it’s further proof the Wright climate report is little more than a political document — written with the express purpose of helping the Trump administration unravel climate rules made possible by the endangerment finding.

The goal of the report is “to basically develop enough soundbite-worthy quotes that policymakers could use … to try to cast doubt on the science” of global warming, said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who organized an academic response to the Wright climate report.

Wright has defended the report as an attempt to counter the narrative of mainstream climate science, which has made clear in thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers that humanity’s burning of fossil fuels is heating the planet, with dangerous repercussions for people and other living things.

“Hydrocarbon-based fuels, the argument goes, must be rapidly abandoned or else we risk planetary ruin,” Wright wrote in a forward to the report.

“That view demands scrutiny,” he continued. “That’s why I commissioned this report: to encourage a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and energy.”

The writers themselves have defended the report too, with author Judith Curry, a former climatologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, telling E&E News that it was a “red herring” to question their independence.

“This issue of ‘independence’ is never raised about scientists employed by, or affiliated with or otherwise supporting, environmental advocacy groups,” she said.

But one climate law expert argued that the authors’ past criticism of the endangerment finding — coupled with their ties to groups that have advocated for its elimination — call into question the Wright report’s credibility.

“It’s the furthest thing from an independent review, it’s a preordained review,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “It’s an additional brick in an already high wall of facts discrediting the report.”

The courts have also shown skepticism toward Wright’s framing of the report as an independent review.

Environmental groups have sued over the Wright report — largely because they don’t want it included in EPA’s review of the endangerment finding.

Last month, a federal judge denied the green groups’ attempts to bar its inclusion. But in doing so, Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts — a Reagan appointee — threw cold water on Wright’s claims about its intentions.

“The conclusion of the report itself shows that it is no mere ‘review’ of the literature. To suggest otherwise borders on sophistry,” Young wrote. “No reasonable jury could find that these words, arranged as they are, do not constitute advice or recommendations for a renewed approach to climate policy.”

Endangerment critics tapped to attack it

The endangerment finding stands out as a milestone in U.S. climate policy — as it empowered the federal government to take more robust action against global warming.

Announced during the first Obama administration, the 2009 determination asserts that six greenhouse gases are driving climate change and that EPA has the authority to regulate these gases in the interest of public health.

The federal government has used the endangerment finding to implement a wide swath of climate regulations, including those intended to reduce greenhouse emissions from vehicles and power plants.

For that reason, conservatives have long sought to overturn the endangerment finding — which they say has been used to drive up prices and create unnecessary regulation.

Among its critics are four of the five authors that Wright tapped to write the July report on climate.

Chief among them is Koonin, a fellow at the Hoover Institution. Koonin organized an adversarial review of climate science during the first Trump administration, and in February, he sent Zeldin an email offering “technical assistance from me and colleagues in the review of the Endangerment Finding.”

Two other authors — University of Alabama climatologist Roy Spencer and University of Guelph economist Ross McKitrick — spoke in May at an event hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation entitled: “Is the Sky Falling, a Reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding.”

During the Heritage event, McKitrick said “most climate policies would make societies worse off.” A 2017 paper written by McKitrick “outlines a case for re-doing the science behind the Endangerment Finding.”

For his part, Spencer was a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation last year as it was promoting a conservative playbook — known as Project 2025 — now being used by the Trump administration to attack a wide range of policies, including climate regulations. The document recommends the Trump administration “establish a system, with an appropriate deadline, to update the 2009 endangerment finding.”

At Heritage, Spencer wrote white papers and blog entries — one of which is cited in the Wright climate report. In the post, Spencer explicitly warns against policy based on climate models, a support beam of the endangerment finding.

He said climate models that warn of significant future warming are “unreliable” — even though mainstream scientists have shown them to be accurate.

Then there is John Christy, a University of Alabama, Huntsville, climatologist, who has spent years attacking climate models and claiming they have been manipulated. He has previously stated that the endangerment finding was a “political exercise” because parts of it were written by Obama administration officials. He pledged to work on rolling back the finding during the first Trump administration.

“When you can prove and demonstrate that climate models used for the basis of the endangerment finding can be falsified, that would at least bring the endangerment finding back for consideration,” he told E&E News in 2017.

Ties to groups opposed to climate action

Wright last week defended the authors’ backgrounds in response to questions from E&E News.

“These are not political people,” Wright said. “All of them were top and well-known scientists.”

He added the report is not about “their personal histories or their past, it’s about the science and the data.”

But at least three of the authors have ties to groups that employ and promote critics of climate action, including the endangerment finding.

In addition to his work with Heritage, Spencer has been affiliated with the Heartland Institute, which has long sought to tear down the endangerment finding.

And McKitrick is a fellow at the Fraser Institute and has been affiliated with the Cato Institute. Both have published and promoted his work advocating against the endangerment finding or other arguments against climate policy.

Koonin’s work for the Hoover Institution has long focused on tearing down the endangerment finding.

Heritage, Heartland, Cato, Hoover and Fraser have long criticized energy regulations and have collectively received millions of dollars in funding from fossil fuel industry groups or foundations that oppose regulations.

The only one of the five authors who did not have an extensive public record of targeting the endangerment finding for rollback is Curry, the former climatologist at Georgia Tech.

Speaking for the other authors of the report, she said their affiliations with outside groups did not shape the report’s findings.

“This whole issue is a red herring,” she wrote in an emailed response to questions. “The scientific content of our report, and any other report, should be judged by its merits.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/59/8e/d3c3615d4123af34c1ff9834c68d/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2235553092,N,,2025-10-20 08:10:54.235741

Why it matters: The rewards and penalties on EVs reflect an industry in flux, as policymakers try to balance environmental goals with the need to pay for roads and other critical infrastructure.

State of play: Biden-era federal tax credits on EV purchases — up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 on pre-owned EVs — were killed by Congress, effective Sept. 30.

Buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring federal credits, leading many forecasters to predict an immediate drop in EV sales.

The numerous states with continuing incentives hope they'll sustain some level of sales momentum.

Yes, but: Ohio doesn't have any, and its fees can run counter to increasing EV adoption, note researchers at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank that mostly supports lower taxes.

Ohioans pay a $200 annual EV registration fee, $150 for plug-in hybrids and $100 for hybrids.

Context: In car sales platform Carvana's 2024 state-by-state breakdown, EV sales in Ohio accounted for just 2.9% of used car sales.

That was lower than the national average (4.3%) and significantly behind EV hot spots that approached 10%.

What we're watching: State lawmakers are once again pushing back with a bipartisan proposal to eliminate the $100 hybrid fee.

The big picture: States fund most of their road and infrastructure budgets with revenues from federal and state gasoline taxes.

But that income isn't enough to meet rising costs, and the funding gap will keep growing as cars get more efficient and EV ownership grows.

Since EV owners don't pay gas taxes, states like Ohio levy the extra fees to ensure they pay their share for road maintenance.

Between the lines: Ohio's lack of EV tax credits may be par for the course, but our EV infrastructure lags far behind other states.

As of January, our 15.5 charging stations per 100,000 residents was far behind the top states, and even neighbors like Michigan and Pennsylvania.

To close the gap, some Central Ohio suburbs are taking matters into their own hands.",https://static.axios.com/img/axios-site/axios-placeholder-16x9.png,N,,2025-10-20 09:03:33.623183

A growing body of research warns that climate disasters are disproportionately dangerous for older adults, especially those in long-term care settings who rely on others for essential support. Those risks are often compounded in rural areas, where resources are scarce and emergency support is slower to arrive.

As temperatures plummeted and power went out across Texas during the February 2021 Winter Storm Uri, a record-breaking winter storm that brought unprecedented cold and ice, staff at Gainesville Nursing and Rehabilitation, a nursing home in the rural North Texas town of Gainesville, made a desperate call: evacuate all 36 residents. The nursing home had lost both power and water and the facility’s backup systems had failed.

Fire-rescue crews scrambled to borrow school buses to move everyone to a temporary shelter at a nearby college. “We had two buses, and it probably took us four hours to move those 36 residents,” Gainesville Fire-Rescue Chief Twiner told the Gainesville Daily Register in 2021. “We had to take some of their beds—there were beds at [the shelter], but it wasn’t enough.”

Research indicates that extreme weather disproportionately affects rural areas, which also have limited capacity to respond to weather events and the prolonged utility outages that often follow.

A 2025 report from the Federation of American Scientists found that rural communities faced heightened risks from extreme heat, with residents more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, limited healthcare access, and older or substandard housing. In rural areas, heat waves disrupted work, strained local businesses, and exposed weaknesses in aging energy infrastructure, revealing a pressing need for targeted investments in health systems and resilient energy.

A 2025 study published in Natural Hazards Review further found that rural communities hit by natural disasters faced significantly longer power outage recovery times than urban areas, highlighting how limited infrastructure and resources can leave rural populations disproportionately vulnerable.

Power Outages Can Lead to Death

New research is beginning to explain the toll that Winter Storm Uri had on older populations in rural areas. The chaos in Gainesville was just one of hundreds of stories that unfolded across Texas in February 2021. Now, a 2025 study has confirmed the human toll of the severe weather event on these communities. Long-term nursing home residents whose facilities lost power or water during the storm faced significantly higher death rates than those in facilities that remained operational.

The peer-reviewed study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), found that utility failures were the driving factor behind the rise in mortality.

“We can estimate that [the outages] would contribute to about 11 or 12 excess deaths, had those nursing homes not experienced a utility outage,” said Brian Downer, PhD, associate professor in the School of Public and Population Health (SPPH) at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and one of the article’s authors. “To better contextualize those 11 excess deaths, the state of Texas was able to attribute about 150 deaths among adults aged 60 and older…to Winter Storm Uri.”

A 2022 study in Nature found that rural communities faced greater challenges during Winter Storm Uri. Limited resources and slower emergency support made outages harder to manage. Residents in these areas were also less prepared for prolonged power loss, highlighting vulnerabilities in infrastructure and disaster response.

“It is the rural communities that are being disproportionately affected by the power outages,” Downer said about the Nature study.

New Texas Legislation Helps Essential Services Adapt to Severe Weather

In response to such risks, the Texas Legislature authorized $1.8 billion this year for the Texas Backup Power Package, an initiative aimed at strengthening energy resilience through backup power systems and microgrids in critical facilities, including those in rural areas. The program, funded through the broader Texas Energy Fund, was designed to ensure that essential services like nursing homes, hospitals, and water systems are better equipped to remain operational during future grid emergencies.

“The extreme weather events that crippled Texas in recent years made it clear this investment was overdue,” said Texas State Representative Ana Hernandez, who serves on the Texas Backup Power Package Advisory Committee. “These backup systems allow vital facilities to keep operating even if the main grid goes down.”

The Texas Backup Power Package was passed in 2023, but didn’t receive funding until the 2025 legislative session. It will provide grants and loans for generators, battery storage, and solar systems.

State Representative Hernandez said the program rules will be drafted later this year and applications are expected online by spring 2026, with installations starting that summer. Final eligibility is still being decided, but critical facilities will be prioritized.

“By providing multi-day, stand-alone backup systems, the program ensures that vital services don’t go dark when the grid fails. Health centers, senior living facilities, emergency responders, and other critical operations will be able to stay open and serve the public,” Hernandez said. “In short, it helps communities hold steady in the face of long outages and strengthens overall resilience.”

Outages Deepened Health Risks for Older Adults

During Winter Storm Uri, Texas experienced historically low temperatures and sweeping power failures as the state’s electric grid struggled to meet surging demand.

According to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 578 of the state’s 1,212 nursing homes, nearly half, reported at least one incident during the storm, including 139 that lost power, 327 that had to boil water, and 121 that suffered burst pipes, water shortages, or complete water loss.

An estimated 39,000 residents, about half of all nursing home residents in the state, lived in facilities that reported such incidents, according to data compiled by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

For residents, those outages were more than an inconvenience. They intensified existing health risks and exposed the particular dangers that extreme temperatures pose to older adults.

Andrea Earl, associate state director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Texas, said older adults in care facilities faced heightened risks during extreme temperatures because their bodies struggle to regulate heat and cold. Many residents also have mobility issues, chronic health conditions, or cognitive impairments that limit self-care. Medication, medical equipment needs, and social isolation further increased vulnerability to extreme temperatures, according to Earl. But some nursing facilities lacked staff expertise to recognize early signs of heat or cold stress, making reliable utilities critical for protecting residents’ health.

Some of the effects of extreme weather and utility outages are not immediately detectable.

“In extreme cold, your blood starts to thicken, especially if you’re older, and that increases the risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular incidents. And I think the hard part about both is these things don’t come on right away,” Earl said.

In the JAMA study, researchers captured these longer term effects by reviewing outcomes over the course of the weeks following the storm.

“We really need to start paying attention to these more delayed effects that are coming up,” said Alex Holland, a doctoral student in population health sciences at UTMB and a co-author of the JAMA article. “In our study, we didn’t really see that difference in mortality until three weeks after winter storm Uri, so there’s somewhat of a delayed effect.”

New Backup Systems Target Future Outages

The Texas Backup Power Package aims to strengthen the state’s energy infrastructure by installing generators, microgrids, and batteries at critical facilities across the state that could run independently when there are grid failures.

Winter Storm Uri caused economic losses upwards of $80 billion. The state’s power grid faced an unprecedented surge in electricity demand and critical parts of the system failed.

To prevent a total collapse that could have taken weeks or even months to recover from, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages most of Texas’s electric grid, implemented emergency blackouts.

Some of the water shortages were directly tied to ERCOT emergency directives, which required utilities to reduce power consumption to stabilize the electric grid.

In Medina County, a rural area west of San Antonio, water was unavailable during Winter Storm Uri, even for essential needs like drinking, bathing, and flushing toilets. Nursing homes in the county were among those affected, facing dangerous conditions as power and water systems failed.

As part of their research, Downer and Holland spoke with nurse practitioners at UTMB who conduct home visits to nursing homes in the area. They said the access to water can be critical to mitigate health risks and manage hygiene.

“[The nurse practitioners] were really emphasizing how both physical and oral hygiene can be really important, not only to just general quality of life and a person’s comfort, but also, too, from an infection risk, especially when it comes to oral health,” Downer said. “We felt that it would be interesting to include water outages for that reason. And then also, too, since power and water outages tend to occur together.”

Those health risks are amplified in rural areas, where limited infrastructure and slower emergency response make outages harder to manage.

Although this utility collapse was widely attributed to frozen power plants, a University of Texas study highlighted the need for better energy efficiency measures to reduce strain on the grid and protect vulnerable populations during extreme weather events.

“There’s a whole host of reasons why extreme weather events can result in lower supply,” said Joshua Rhodes, PhD, a research scientist at the University of Texas and one of the report’s authors. “[During Winter Storm Uri,] we saw [that] every single kind of power plant didn’t perform as well as we would have liked it to perform. We saw power plants freeze, be they coal, natural gas or nuclear, wind. We saw snow on top of solar panels. But we also saw the natural gas sector freeze…we lost the ability to produce about 80% of the natural gas in the Permian Basin, and so we weren’t able to move as much natural gas. We also had a bunch of power plants that just couldn’t get fuel.”

Winter Storm Uri brought the state’s energy sector to a standstill and future extreme weather threatens to do the same.

“Texas is seeing more disasters as more people live in areas where we have hurricanes, and as, just generally, more people are around, and we rely on more things for electricity,” Rhodes said.

To boost energy resilience, Texas lawmakers approved $1.8 billion in 2025 for the Texas Backup Power Package.

“We’re recognizing that there are thousands of facilities across the state, many in rural areas, but some also in urban areas, that provide vital community services, like water treatment facilities, fresh water facilities, assisted living centers and other medical facilities…,” said Texas Senator Nathan Johnson, who led legislation to create and fund the Texas Backup Power Package. “So in order to make that more affordable, what we wanted to do is just put some state money behind it.”

“Modern life runs on electricity,” Rhodes said. “I think it’s good that we’re at least keeping the critical parts of that life, of that livelihood, up and running whenever we run into issues.”

An Uncertain Pathway Forward

Researchers and advocates said that while the Texas Backup Power Package has potential to serve long-term care residents, it is not a guaranteed fix.

During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers failed to pass SB 481, which would have required nursing and assisted living facilities in Texas to maintain safe temperatures during emergencies with backup power systems. Without such state regulations, Earl expressed concern that many facilities may be unaware of the Texas Backup Power Package program or lack the capacity to apply for it.

“A lot of these places are understaffed…so any extra administrative processes might be a hindrance to why they would apply,” Earl said. “We’re hopeful that facilities out there are paying attention to [the backup power package], but I think that’s another thing too. How well is this fund going to be marketed? Are we going to see these facilities know firsthand that they can apply for this? How are they going to find out about it?”

Holland said that the successful implementation of backup power also depends on training and education for effective emergency preparedness.

“Now there’s funding available to help with these backup power sources, like the Texas Backup Power Package. But then the question becomes like, well, then what? These facilities might not know, what is the best power supply backup for us? Where should we put them?” Holland said. “We see sometimes that generators end up getting put on the floor and ground level in areas that are prone to flooding or nursing home staff aren’t trained on how to use this emergency backup equipment.”

Without proper guidance and preparation, the funding alone cannot guarantee that facilities will be ready when disaster strikes.

“Disaster preparedness is for everybody,” Holland said. “I think especially that’s something that lends itself very strongly to rural communities [where] you kind of have that ‘everybody knows everybody’ feel. And so taking that into the disaster preparedness side of things, and knowing how your city or your county is preparing for some of these events, or, what are the resources in place, kind of at that local level, also definitely come into mind.”

Earl emphasized that emergency preparedness shouldn’t wait for tragedy.

“We don’t think death should be the underlying reason for, or the catalyst for, doing backup power and requiring a certain level of power in these facilities,” Earl said. “We think that there’s a lot of dignity with this stage of life and where you’re at and that that should be preserved, especially if you are paying to be in a facility and putting your hard earned dollars and assuming and expecting a certain level of care.”

Once Leapmotor begins European production, tariff exemption eliminates the primary cost disadvantage, rendering European competitors' margin structures unsustainable.
Supply chain participation in Chinese EV platforms now flows through European manufacturing hubs rather than direct export relationships.","The compact SUV market in Europe, where full-electric models surged 174 per cent to 257,623 units through August, represents perhaps the industry's most fiercely contested battleground. Into this space steps Leapmotor, Stellantis' Chinese partner, with the B10, priced from just under €30,000 ($35,000). This month's European launch for the new model (expanding on the carmaker's initial 2024 launch in the region), marks a strategic inflection point not merely for Leapmotor International, the Stellantis-led joint venture, but for how legacy automakers must now recalibrate manufacturing footprints to remain competitive.

The tariff context is decisive to this development. Leapmotor currently faces a 30.7 per cent combined duty on exports from China—the result of Brussels' anti-subsidy investigation concluding that Chinese producers benefit from unfair state support. This comprises a 20.7 per cent countervailing duty layered atop the standard 10 per cent import tariff. For extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), the same regime applies, creating a powerful incentive to shift production westward.

Stellantis has already confirmed that B10 manufacturing will commence in Spain next year, though the company declined to specify which of its three Spanish plants—Zaragoza, Madrid, or Vigo—will host production. Spanish automotive capacity offers compelling logic: relatively contained labour costs, an established supplier ecosystem, and unexploited capacity. Industry sources suggest Zaragoza as the likely candidate, though such decisions hinge on broader portfolio optimisation within Stellantis' sprawling manufacturing network.

Stellantis stakes $13bn on US manufacturing renaissance

The transatlantic carmaker's largest-ever domestic commitment signals a decisive pivot towards US production, promising five new vehicles and 5,000 jobs as it pursues a 50% capacity expansion across the industrial Midwest.

This localisation strategy represents a calculated pivot. Rather than accept margin compression from tariff passage, Leapmotor leverages Stellantis' manufacturing asset base to circumvent duties entirely. The economics favour production relocation once volumes justify fixed investment. Leapmotor International aims to sell between 50,000 and 60,000 vehicles globally this year, with Europe accounting for over 70 per cent of sales. These volume expectations suggest Spanish production economics become feasible within 18 months of European launch.

Equally significant is the precedent this establishes. Chinese EV manufacturers—historically dependent upon export-led growth from centralised production hubs—now face structural incentives to embed within European manufacturing infrastructure. Tariff avoidance becomes a lever for platform localisation, supply chain reconfiguration, and eventual deeper integration. Stellantis' infrastructure becomes Leapmotor's Trojan horse.

Technology transfer from China-first development

The B10 represents an intriguing divergence in product development architecture. Launched at the 2024 Paris motor show and developed initially for Chinese markets, the B10 is nonetheless the first model designed by Leapmotor after it acquired Stellantis investment in 2023. Critically, ""Leapmotor has an 18-month time to market, and the B10 is the first new product with inputs from Stellantis,"" according to Francesco Giacalone, head of product and marketing at Leapmotor International, speaking during a media event in Biot, southern France, on 13 October.

This timeline compression signals methodological divergence from traditional European development cycles. Leapmotor's proprietary LEAP 3.5 architecture underpins the B10, derived from platform development rooted in Chinese market requirements. The vehicle stretches 4,515 millimetres, spans 2,735 millimetres between wheels, and stands 1,655 millimetres tall. Such dimensions reflect Chinese consumer preferences: notably generous rear legroom and headroom that European compact SUV customers—accustomed to tighter proportions—may initially find atypical.

The B10's interior architecture reinforces this China-centric genesis. A 14.6-inch central touchscreen dominates the interface, with an 8.8-inch instrument cluster below. Critically, the vehicle eliminates conventional physical switches entirely—a design philosophy prevalent in contemporary Chinese models but rare in European offerings. Keyless entry utilises NCF-enabled credit card-sized access fobs swiped on the driver's side mirror, or the Leapmotor smartphone application. Drivers shift from park to drive or reverse electronically, with engagement requiring only the touchscreen.

This interface minimalism reflects divergent design philosophies between Chinese and European automotive traditions. Rather than retrofit European ergonomic expectations onto a China-optimised platform, Leapmotor implements iterative adaptation. Francesco Giacalone noted previously that after receiving criticism regarding the C10 midsize SUV's driver-assistance system usability, the company developed a solution within six weeks—a responsiveness considerably exceeding traditional European development cadences. The imminent arrival of updated control interfaces enabling faster deactivation of advanced driver-assistance systems exemplifies this agility.

Battery architecture points to cost competitiveness. The entry-level B10 incorporates a 56.2-kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate battery pack delivering a 361-kilometre WLTP range. The long-range variant employs a 67.1-kWh LFP unit achieving 434 kilometres. In comparative testing, a long-range B10 demonstrated real-world consumption of approximately 15 kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometres, precisely aligning with official WLTP homologation—a rarity suggesting either conservative testing methodology or genuine efficiency gains from vertical integration. Charging speeds from a 168-kilowatt fast charger enable 50 per cent battery replenishment within 20 minutes for both variants.

The technological substrate reflects Leapmotor's historical competitive advantage: vertical integration across electric drive systems, battery engineering, and software architecture. Rather than reliance upon third-party components, Leapmotor manufactures proprietary drivetrains and battery modules in-house, mitigating supply chain fragmentation and cost inflation endemic to modular approaches.

Segment disruption through cost architecture

Through August, the Volkswagen ID.4 held segment leadership with 51,582 European registrations, marginally ahead of the newly launched Skoda Elroq at 48,975 units and Kia EV3 at 45,270. These three models account for approximately 57 per cent of full-electric compact SUV sales. The B10, by contrast, arrives with aggressive pricing that directly challenges margin expectations.

A Skoda Elroq with a 52-kWh battery and 350-kilometre WLTP range commands €33,900 ($39,500) in Germany. The equivalent Volkswagen ID.4 specification—identical battery capacity, 364-kilometre range—lists at €40,395 ($47,100). Leapmotor's entry-level B10, delivering superior battery capacity (56.2 kWh), comparable range (361 kilometres), and broader interior space, launches from just under €30,000.

China's Hybrid EV shift demands Western production pivot

A new survey reveals how Chinese consumers are reshaping global automotive production priorities, with technology trumping price wars and plug-in hybrids gaining ground over pure battery electric vehicles: McKinsey

This pricing architecture warrants structural analysis. Chinese automotive cost bases historically benefit from lower labour outlays, streamlined supplier ecosystems, and government support mechanisms. Yet Leapmotor's European positioning transcends simple labour arbitrage. The company achieves cost advantage through platform efficiency: the B10 derives from a China-developed architecture requiring no fundamental European adaptation, thus circumventing development cost capitalisation.

LFP battery chemistry, commodified through scale, undercuts NCA/NCM alternatives favoured by European competitors. Vertical integration reduces component costs substantially relative to modular approaches. Finally, distribution through Stellantis networks leverages existing infrastructure rather than establishing standalone dealer networks.

Leapmotor's margin mathematics and inverted market approach

Margin mathematics have become unforgiving for incumbents. Volkswagen's traditional financial models assume moderate volume, premium pricing, and high-margin software-as-a-service revenue. Leapmotor inverts this: accept slimmer per-unit contribution margins in exchange for volume acceleration and market share penetration. For manufacturers like Volkswagen and Skoda, this represents profound strategic distress. The combination of lower pricing, comparable technology, and superior interior space directly attacks the value proposition upon which established players have constructed European distribution strategies.

Crucially, this represents the first tangible test of whether tariff regimes can arrest Chinese competitive encroachment. The EU imposed definitive countervailing duties ranging from 7.8 per cent for Tesla to 35.3 per cent for SAIC, with Leapmotor facing 20.7 per cent additional levy. Leapmotor's tariff is marginally lower than BYD's 17 per cent rate, suggesting EU investigators viewed Leapmotor as less culpable of subsidy capture than the industry leader. Yet even at 30.7 per cent combined duty, importation economics remain viable through the remainder of 2024.

The strategic calculation shifts upon Spanish manufacturing commencement. Once Leapmotor begins European production, tariff exemption eliminates the primary cost disadvantage, rendering European competitors' margin structures unsustainable. Volkswagen's strategic warning that tariffs ""are not suitable for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry in the long term,"" reflected precisely this calculus: tariffs neither prevent Chinese expansion nor improve incumbent positioning, merely accelerating the localisation of Chinese manufacturing capacity.

Leapmotor International's trajectory reflects broader industrial restructuring. The company commenced European sales last September with the T03 minicar and C10 midsize SUV. Through August 2025, Leapmotor accumulated 13,095 European registrations, with the T03 commanding 8,924 units. This progression—from market entry to segment penetration to mainstream competitive challenge—compressed into fewer than 12 months, underscores the velocity advantage Chinese manufacturers maintain once European manufacturing capacity materialises.

BYD’s record UK sales in September, despite being shut out of subsidy schemes, underline a wider reckoning for UK auto manufacturing strategy. An industry built on incentives and protection needs fresh foundations in design, export and resilience.

Extended-range electric vehicle expansion amplifies this competitive challenge. ""With EREVs we lure customers who are attracted by electric vehicles, but not ready yet for a battery-only vehicle and its related range and charge anxiety,"" Giacalone stated. Leapmotor intends to introduce B10 REEV variants within approximately six months, potentially paired with an allwheel-drive electric configuration through front-axle motor addition. No determination has been reached regarding Spanish manufacture of REEV or allwheel-drive variants, though tariff economics mirror those of full-electric models—a combined 30.7 per cent duty applying to extended-range vehicles exported from China.

The REEV positioning deserves particular attention. European consumer adoption of plug-in hybrid technology has accelerated, particularly among buyers exhibiting range anxiety or requiring flexibility between electric and conventional propulsion. By offering B10 REEV variants at near-parity pricing with full-electric equivalents—a strategic contrast to European competitors' conventional hybrid pricing structures—Leapmotor addresses a psychological barrier that tariff analysis frequently overlooks. Tariffs address only cost, not consumer preference fragmentation.

Stellantis' strategic positioning merits consideration. Under new chief executive Antonio Filosa, Leapmotor represents ""a very good"" investment, announced at September investor conferences. For Stellantis, the partnership simultaneously achieves multiple objectives: access to cost-competitive Chinese EV technology, leverage of excess Spanish manufacturing capacity, direct participation in segment growth, and customer acquisition through differentiated pricing.

Francesco Ciancia returns to lead Stellantis global production

Stellantis has appointed Francesco Ciancia as Global Head of Manufacturing, reuniting with an executive whose international experience in lean production and transformation will shape its future operations.

Critically, Stellantis absorbs no technology transfer obligation, maintains manufacturing control, and retains distribution authority—a structuring vastly preferable to conventional joint venture arrangements burdening European manufacturers in China.

Implications for competitive positioning

The B10 articulates a fundamental competitive discontinuity. European manufacturers have historically competed through premium positioning, technological differentiation, and margin protection. Chinese competitors, by contrast, deploy cost leadership and margin sacrifice to achieve volume. This divergence has intensified as tariff regimes fail to alter competitive incentives, instead merely accelerating localisation timelines.

For procurement and manufacturing organisations, the B10 represents a signal event. Spanish automotive capacity, long viewed as secondary to German manufacturing excellence, suddenly becomes critical to competitive survival. Supply chain participation in Chinese EV platforms now flows through European manufacturing hubs rather than direct export relationships. Tariff avoidance through localisation becomes a cornerstone of competitive strategy rather than a contingency planning exercise.

The implications extend across the automotive value chain. Battery suppliers, previously dependent upon Volkswagen, Renault, and PSA volume commitments, now navigate a fragmented market where Chinese vertically integrated competitors participate alongside traditional module and cell suppliers. Supplier margin compression accelerates. Tier-one system integrators face erosion of software-to-customer relationships as over-the-air update architectures enable manufacturers to capture software monetisation directly. Dealer networks confront margin pressure from simplified Chinese vehicle architectures requiring reduced service intensity.

This AMS livestream investigates how automotive manufacturers and suppliers are adapting existing and new factories to produce EVs and electrified vehicles.

For manufacturing strategy specifically, the B10 confirms that tariff regimes address symptoms rather than causes. Chinese cost competitiveness stems not from subsidies alone, but from integrated manufacturing ecosystems, labour arbitrage, platform efficiency, and willingness to accept lower per-unit contribution margins.

European manufacturing must either match Chinese cost structures through automation, efficiency gains, and supply chain reconfiguration, or retreat to higher-value segments where technological differentiation justifies premium pricing. The B10 permits neither approach: Leapmotor prices aggressively whilst incorporating contemporary technology, eliminating the margin buffer traditional competitors require.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/1591312.jpg?imageId=1591312&x=0&y=4.08&cropw=100&croph=87.76&panox=0&panoy=4.08&panow=100&panoh=87.76&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-10-20 12:12:11.015407

The program was designed to support access to solar energy for low-income households and disadvantaged communities.

A Biden-era program, SFA was expected to support over 4 GW of distributed solar deployment in 5 years. A total of 60 winners were selected for grants and low-cost financing to support solar installations across 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and territories (see Joe Biden Announces $7 Billion In Grants For Residential Solar).

On August 7, 2025, the EPA terminated the program ‘to remain aligned with Congressional intent’. The Working Families Tax Cut repealed the EPA’s authority to administer the program and rescinded all remaining funds.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had stated back then, “With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”

Now, in lawsuits filed by the multistate coalition with the United States District Court Western District of Washington and the Court of Federal Claims, the petitioners have called out the EPA for ‘unilaterally and illegally’ terminating the multi-billion-dollar program that would have provided solar energy to more than 900,000 households.

These lawsuits follow a similar one that was recently filed by a coalition of environmental groups in the federal court in Rhode Island. The plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, Rhode Island Center for Justice, Solar United Neighbors, Sunpath Consulting, Black Sunlight Sustainability, among others.

The complainants argue that the funds had already been obligated by the EPA, meaning legally committed to the program. They also started building out their state SFA programs before the EPA terminated the SFA. Further, the US Congress did not authorize or direct the terminations of the program.

According to the lawsuits filed, Congress repealed large parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, but did not repeal the SFA program retroactively. It rescinded only unobligated balances that preserved all $7 billion of the obligated funding already awarded by the EPA for the SFA.

“Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be harmed by Defendants’ executive overreach. By arbitrarily terminating a program in which Plaintiffs participated and which was expected to bring substantial benefits to Plaintiffs and their residents, Defendants have illegally eliminated Plaintiffs’ ability to participate in and benefit from the SFA Program,” reads the lawsuit.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who has joined the multistate coalition alongside the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), said the SFA termination denies states of critical funds needed for low-income and disadvantaged communities in the country. California alone was allocated almost $250 million in SFA funds.

“At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy,” said Bonta. “Solar for All was built to deliver relief for all Americans — by lowering energy bills for working families, reducing our carbon footprint, and creating high-quality union jobs that would bolster our economy. We will not let this illegal termination of the Solar for All Program stand.”

They now seek the court to declare the terminations as unlawful, SFA funding to be restored or redistributed to SFA recipients, and the program to be reinstated.

Swear in Adelita Grijalva.","Details

By Levi Rickert

October 20, 2025

Opinion. When U.S. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) passed away on March 13, 2025 at the age of 77, Indian Country lost one of its strongest voices in Congress. After more than two decades in Congress, Grijalva championed Native American issues, supporting tribal sovereignty, environmental justice and education equity.

Grijalva’s district, Arizona’s 7th Congressional District — stretching from Tucson to the Phoenix suburbs — is home to the Tohono O’odham Nation, Pascua Yaqui Tribe and Cocopah Tribe. According to 2024 Census estimates, more than 30,000 Native people live in the district.

These tribes, along with more than 800,000 residents, have been left without a representative in Congress for more than six months.

In a special election held Sept. 23, 2025, voters chose Grijalva’s daughter, Adelita Grijalva, 54, to carry on her father’s legacy, which includes his support of Indian country. She won decisively, with 69% of the vote—defeating her Republican opponent by a 40-point margin. Yet, despite this clear electoral mandate, Grijalva has not been sworn in.

The reason? Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) has refused to administer the oath, citing procedural concerns related to the ongoing government shutdown. But observers from across the political spectrum aren’t buying that explanation. Many believe the real motive is political — and personal.

Grijalva’s swearing-in has been tied up in Johnson’s calculations around the House’s razor-thin majority. Her vote would be the 218th and final signature needed to force a vote on a bipartisan discharge petition to release Justice Department files tied to Jeffrey Epstein — the convicted sex offender with powerful associates in both political parties.

Johnson says the delay is “standard practice,” but that claim doesn’t hold up. Members of Congress — Republican and Democrat alike — have been sworn in during recesses and even during pro-forma sessions. The rules, when politically convenient, have been flexible. But now, with a key vote hanging in the balance, the process has suddenly hardened.

Meanwhile, Grijalva says her Capitol Hill office lacks computers. She cannot access the office congressional email system or hire staff. Her district has no voice in Congress.

For Native constituents in Arizona’s 7th District, the absence is especially significant. These communities often face underrepresentation and systemic neglect. To leave them without a representative—after they voted overwhelmingly—is an affront to the values of representative democracy.

Johnson’s delay has the practical effect of protecting members of his party from a politically uncomfortable vote. The bipartisan Epstein petition — led by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) — seeks to force transparency on a matter that should never have been hidden in the first place. But Johnson, who claims to support transparency, has quietly worked to block the effort.

By withholding Adelita Grijalva’s swearing-in, Johnson preserves the Republican majority by one vote and keeps the petition from triggering a floor vote. It’s a maneuver of convenience—not principle. He insists that the delay has nothing to do with the Epstein files. But the timeline—and the stakes—tell a different story.

This is not about ceremony. It’s about control.

When citizens cast their ballots in a free and fair election, they expect the winner to take office. Period. Delays like this erode trust — not just in a political party, but in democracy itself. What message does it send when a duly elected representative from a border district — who happens to be Latina and Native-serving — is told to wait her turn while Johnson plays procedural games?

Adelita Grijalva said it best: “The people of Southern Arizona have voted clearly, yet more than 812,000 people are still denied their voice in Congress.”

Special elections in Republican-leaning districts have not faced this kind of obstruction. GOP winners have been seated during House recesses or without ceremony. In Grijalva’s case, however, the clock keeps ticking — and so does the silence from Washington.

Adelita Grijalva deserves to be sworn in without delay—not because of who her father was, but because her district voted for her. She earned the trust of her constituents and should be working on their behalf right now.

Johnson’s refusal to seat her amounts to disenfranchisement. It denies representation to hundreds of thousands of Americans — Native and non-Native alike. And it does so in service of political strategy, not constitutional duty.

Every day this delay continues, the House of Representatives becomes less representative. Democracy suffers. Transparency stalls. And the message to voters becomes painfully clear: Your voice matters only when it’s politically convenient.

It’s time for Johnson to stop hiding behind the process and do his job. Swear in Adelita Grijalva. Let the people’s voice be heard. Let her get working on behalf of the Arizona tribes in the 7th congressional district.

Anything less is a betrayal of democracy.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-10-20 09:05:47+00:00,The Indianapolis Star,Wind and solar face resistance in Indiana despite statewide push for more energy options,"Sophie Hartley, Elizabeth Weise, Karl Schneider",,,,,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2025/10/20/wind-solar-face-resistance-indiana-despite-governor-braun-push-more-energy-options/86676693007/,"“I'm concerned about that for all energy development,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana's top energy official, in an interview with IndyStar.
This is considered a “suitable” speed for wind energy development, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Indiana’s first wind project, the Benton County Wind Farm, went online in 2008.
One solution proposed by Indiana lawmakers is creating statewide standards for renewable energy projects.
Right now, individual Indiana counties have the authority to create ordinances dictating regulations on solar and wind project developments.","Energy seems to be on everyone’s mind these days.

Hoosiers are watching their electric bills balloon, communities are rallying against energy-gobbling data centers, and government officials, consumer advocates and utilities have competing interests and ideas for how to move forward, including building several nuclear reactors.

All the while, opportunities for renewable energy development — which could quickly alleviate some of the pain from electric bills and electricity demand from new industry — are constricting across the state.

A USA TODAY and IndyStar investigation found that 40 of Indiana’s 92 counties had bans or impediments on new wind development and 24 counties had similar restrictions on solar energy as of September 2025. Battery storage systems, which are emissions-free energy sources, are also facing opposition; a Hamilton County proposal was axed this summer after the community pushed back.

With energy demands anticipated to rise significantly in the coming years, especially due to the buildout of AI and data centers, the speed at which wind and solar projects can be built is in their favor. A solar farm can go up in as little as 18 months. With current gas turbine backlogs, a natural gas plant can take five years and nuclear a decade or more.

Gov. Mike Braun campaigned on an all-of-the-above approach to addressing the state’s energy crisis, so for Braun's energy secretary, the county-level pushback to new renewable development isn't helping Indiana’s beleaguered energy grid.

“I'm concerned about that for all energy development,” said Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana's top energy official, in an interview with IndyStar.

Counties currently have power over whether or not to allow projects like wind and solar. Efforts to move more authority to the state level have failed in recent years, and controversy over who should green-light energy projects remains. Jaworowski has previously railed against counties who court energy projects for months or years, only to reject them in the end. She called the practice “disgraceful” according to reporting from the Indiana Capital Chronicle.

So, the state is working on a solution.

Jaworowski hopes to unveil the first iteration of a map in November that could guide interested developers toward counties looking to bring in more industry, which would include renewable energy projects.

“We're trying to be strategic about inviting counties to raise their hand to say, ‘Yeah, we're interested in this,’ or ‘No, we're not,’” Jaworowski said. Counties can note interest in industrial projects like wind, solar, batteries, nuclear or even data centers.

It’s not a commitment, Jaworowski added. Rather, it’s a way for counties and developers to match interests early in the development process so as not to waste time and money.

Indiana feels the breeze

Even without state guidance, developers found their way into Indiana counties to build renewable projects decades ago.

Bryan Berry, a Benton County landowner who later became a commissioner, started wondering about bringing wind to the county in the late 1990s.

When he raised the idea to sitting commissioners, “they laughed at me,” Berry said. They “said that will never happen, you know, it’s not windy enough here to do that.”

But Benton, on the western edge of Indiana, is one of the breeziest parts of the country where it counts: hundreds of feet above the county’s fields and farmland.

Developers eventually caught wind of the county’s potential. When they touched down in the mid-2000s they were met with swaths of wide-open farmland and high wind speeds. Eighty meters (about 262 feet) above some of the plains in central and northern Indiana, the wind races past at more than 7.5 meters per second (about 25 feet per second). This is considered a “suitable” speed for wind energy development, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Berry saw early on the county was poised to gain financially if it allowed wind farms to move in.

“There’s not a lot of industry, not a lot of jobs, and not a lot of people,” he said. This trifecta can make taxes a burden for rural families. But wind development could lead to an influx in the county’s assessed valuation and drop property tax rates.

Indiana’s first wind project, the Benton County Wind Farm, went online in 2008. That spring, Indiana’s first turbines — 85 in total — started adding megawatts to the grid.

And over the next several years, Berry saw property tax rates drop.

“I don’t know where it would be if we didn’t have the assessed value of the wind turbines,” he said.

Development across the state has since escalated. Now, most of the state’s wind projects sit in a corridor that stretches from Benton County east to Randolph on the Ohio border. By mid-2024, Indiana had about 3,400 megawatts of wind capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Over 10 percent of Indiana’s total in-state energy production came from wind in 2024, and over 3 percent came from solar.

Indiana feels the burn

But Benton was a special case.

Despite the economic boon wind and solar can provide for rural economies, county governments across the state have begun placing significant impediments and outright bans on their development. Many of the restrictions have cropped up over the last two years.

Some counties have such strict regulations on noise or location that it has become effectively impossible to build new wind projects. For example, from the front porch of a nearby house, wind turbines don't typically sound louder than a household refrigerator, which hums at around 55 dBA. But Wabash County limits sound from turbines to 32 dBA.

Counties like Huntington restrict solar panels from being placed on “prime farmland,” and counties like Jay and Parke have placed temporary moratoriums on wind, solar and/or battery storage.

County-wide pushback like this is concerning for organizations like the Indiana Conservative Alliance for Energy (ICAE).

Like Jaworowski, ICAE wants to see an all-of-the-above approach to energy in Indiana, which would encompass everything from coal and nuclear to solar, wind and hydropower. So the organization is trying to divert conversations about wind and solar away from politics, which has historically influenced attitudes toward renewables.

“We need to have more of these fact-based conversations to really make good energy policy,” Anderson said. Bringing the conversations about renewable energy out of the ever-changing political landscape is important, he added, because projects take so long to get approval. It's difficult for developers to propose projects will satisfy the energy grid's needs and the needs of their business model when national attitudes can change on a whim.

One solution proposed by Indiana lawmakers is creating statewide standards for renewable energy projects. Right now, individual Indiana counties have the authority to create ordinances dictating regulations on solar and wind project developments. Other states, like Wisconsin, have seen much of this control moved to the state level.

Indiana attempted to implement similar statewide standards, but proposed bills faltered in 2021 and in 2025. Simply put, it's controversial.

Unsubstantiated rumors still swirl online and in county meetings that wind, solar and battery storage facilities will degrade the environment, destroy rural culture and lower property values.

“It is just so hyper-partisan and political that often that’s drowning out the facts,” said Topher Anderson, the director of programs and operations for ICAE. “The facts are, things like wind and solar are really fast to deploy, and once you get them on, they’re the cheapest dollar per megawatt hour.”

“Utilities across the country are warning operators to be ready for sudden power shutoffs,” explained James Roth, the head of global policy and government affairs at Bloom Energy.
Operators begin to recognize the value of onsite systems in the face of unexpected utility power shutoffs.
The logic is simple: the more control a data center has over its power, the less exposed it is to regulatory risk and sudden disconnections.
What that means in practice, however, is that a new method of data center siting is emerging, where the map is drawn around storage potential rather than just transmission lines.","In Texas, a new kind of reliability standard is reshaping where data centers choose to build and how they power their operations. Under a “kill switch” law that was adopted earlier this year, utilities can forcibly disconnect large, noncritical industrial users like hyperscale data centers during grid emergencies to keep electricity flowing to the largest number of people.

“Utilities across the country are warning operators to be ready for sudden power shutoffs,” explained James Roth, the head of global policy and government affairs at Bloom Energy. He told ESS News that, for operators with contractual uptime commitments, the risk of sudden shutoffs is “simply unsustainable.”

While the Texas bill does also include a voluntary demand response program, it could still spell trouble for data center operators with 24/7 uptime guarantees or AI workloads that can’t afford a second of downtime. That’s where storage comes in. Operators begin to recognize the value of onsite systems in the face of unexpected utility power shutoffs.

The logic is simple: the more control a data center has over its power, the less exposed it is to regulatory risk and sudden disconnections. In Texas, that could look like installing batteries capable of supporting independent operations when a kill switch is triggered.

According to Roth, it’s no surprise that major cloud players like Oracle are looking to shield their operations using onsite storage and generation. What that means in practice, however, is that a new method of data center siting is emerging, where the map is drawn around storage potential rather than just transmission lines.

The general idea remains the same across state lines, but what it looks like in practice varies greatly. In California, for instance, ensuring steady access to power as quickly as possible means designing storage-backed microgrids that let a data center jump the queue and bypass long interconnection wait times.

It’s more of a structural problem, though it’s one that makes traditional grid expansion nearly impossible at the pace AI-driven workloads demand.

“Operators there are adopting islanded microgrids to bypass utility delays,” explained Roth. But, he cautioned, there’s also a political dimension.

California’s Application for Certification (AFC) process still treats onsite systems over a certain size as “thermal” plants regardless of the type of energy they use. Effectively, this locks the project into a series of slow-moving environmental reviews designed for gas infrastructure.

“Lengthy permitting constructs like California’s AFC process…must be reinterpreted,” Roth added, “to accommodate new solutions that can be deployed quickly and reliably.”

“Getting the policy framework right will determine whether the US effectively captures the economic benefits of the AI boom,” he noted.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2048px-Bloom_Energy_Servers_at_eBay.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:08:13.815208

What data center developers are looking for Voltus already has one developer on board to participate in its bring-your-own-capacity plan: Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which builds gigawatt-scale data centers.
Data center developers will face cost and air-quality challenges in using their ubiquitous diesel-fueled backup generators for on-site power.
Similar pressures are pushing up costs across the Midwest, and in data center hotspots like Georgia and Texas.","Data centers are creating problems for the congested, overburdened U.S. power grid. One company thinks it can crowdsource the solution.

California-based Voltus operates ​“virtual power plants” across North America, controlling the amount of electricity that participating homes and businesses consume or send to the grid via resources like rooftop solar and batteries.

Last month, the firm unveiled its ​“bring your own capacity” plan. Put simply, the idea is for data center operators to pay other utility customers to reduce their power use when electricity demand peaks, a move that would diminish strain on the system without disrupting computing processes at data centers.

The proposal comes as the nationwide boom in data center construction pushes electricity demand — and prices — to new heights. These conditions are putting pressure on data center developers, utilities, regulators, and regional grid operators to find ways to enable rapid construction that don’t break the grid, or customers’ wallets.

That’s where the bring-your-own-capacity concept could fill the gaps, said Dana Guernsey, Voltus’ CEO and cofounder.

The approach benefits utilities and their customers because it’s a lot cheaper to reduce energy use than it is to build new power plants and infrastructure. And it benefits data centers by offering a much faster route to getting a grid interconnection, as developers wouldn’t have to wait years for utilities to bring new power generation online.

“The hyperscalers and data center developers are eager to fund this,” Guernsey told Canary Media. ​“It’s more affordable, it’s faster, and it’s an investment back into the communities.”

Voltus is in a good position to spearhead this work, she said. As a virtual power plant operator, it already aggregates backup batteries, electric vehicles, smart appliances, and other fast-responding technologies to provide on-demand relief to the grid. Voltus was recently dubbed the top company in this sector by analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, and after several years of rapid growth, it now has more than 7.5 gigawatts of scattered ​“demand response” capacity under management.

In general, virtual power plants, or VPPs, could meet 10% to 20% of U.S. peak grid needs in the coming years and save utility customers roughly $10 billion in annual costs, according to a U.S. Department of Energy analysis released in January. Voltus’ new plan is to harness the power of VPPs to help specifically with the data-center-driven electricity crunch — a creative idea with big potential, if the company can convince utilities to play ball.

What data center developers are looking for

Voltus already has one developer on board to participate in its bring-your-own-capacity plan: Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which builds gigawatt-scale data centers.

“The right way to serve data center load quickly, at scale, and less expensively and more sustainably, is to leverage the existing resources on the grid as efficiently as possible,” said Brian Janous, Cloverleaf’s chief commercial officer.

Data centers, which are facing yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, are considering every available option. In Wisconsin, Cloverleaf is planning a flagship data center project that could draw up to 3.5 gigawatts of power from the grid when it’s fully built at the end of 2030. Cloverleaf has worked with utility We Energies and its parent company, WEC Energy Group, to develop a tariff that will put the onus on Cloverleaf to pay for the new resources the utility is building to meet its facility’s energy needs.

While specifics on that deal remain confidential, Janous noted that it could include demand response and VPP resources.

“The conversation we’ve been having with utilities is, we want to connect fast. If you tell us, ​‘You have to come back in seven years, after the completion of my latest gas-fired power plant,’ I’ll go somewhere else,” he said. But if Cloverleaf can work with a company like Voltus to supply the necessary energy capacity within months, a utility may be able to connect a data center faster.

Guernsey highlighted other examples of data centers bringing their own capacity to utilities. In August, Google announced agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority to reduce the peak loads of data centers in their territories.

Most of the attention on those deals focused on Google’s commitment to shift its computing workloads to reduce peak grid demand — a novel approach to data center power flexibility that tackles the electricity consumption of the massive racks of servers within the facilities’ walls.

But part of Google’s deal with Indiana Michigan Power includes transferring credits for a portion of carbon-free energy Google has contracted to serve its data centers in the region to help the utility meet its capacity requirements. In this case, the tech giant offered up its renewable-energy resources to cover its data centers’ power use, but Google could have leveraged VPPs for that purpose just as easily, Guernsey said.

Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for Wood Mackenzie, agreed that VPPs are theoretically a faster and cheaper means of achieving data center flexibility compared to the alternatives.

Most tech companies haven’t done the hard work that Google has done over the past decade or so to enable flexible computing, he said. Data center developers will face cost and air-quality challenges in using their ubiquitous diesel-fueled backup generators for on-site power. And they may be loath to invest in more expensive options like on-site solar, batteries, and gas-fired generators and microturbines — the ​“build-your-own-power plants” model some developers are pursuing.

“We don’t think that’s going to be faster or cheaper or more sustainable,” Janous said of the latter model. ​“We think the better approach is to work with companies like Voltus on how to bring more available resources into the mix.”

Demand-response programs and VPPs can also counteract utility customers’ rising power bills, since these initiatives financially compensate the individuals who allow their energy use to be managed.

“You’re paying homeowners and business owners to be part of the solution to accommodate data centers,” Hertz-Shargel said. ​“They’re already facing large and growing bill increases, not just because of large loads but because of utility investments, costs of climate change. This is a way to offset that.”

Are data center developers willing to pay?

It won’t be easy to turn these ideas into reality.

Utilities and regional grid operators consider demand response and VPPs primarily as a tool for managing existing grid stresses, but are far less eager to allow VPPs to substitute for building more traditional power plants and upgrading the grid. It’s always a tall order to get utilities to do something for the first time, but especially so when dealing with data centers, which can require a small city’s worth of electricity for their operations.

Guernsey conceded these challenges to Voltus’ plan. ​“Most of the deals we’re discussing start in 2027 or 2028 time frame,” she said. ​“We’re just running as fast as we can to keep up. We’re growing at a clip of about a gigawatt a year across North America. … In particular regions where data centers are getting built, we usually respond with, ​‘We can get a couple hundred megawatts in a given territory within that time.’”

One of Voltus’ key early targets is PJM Interconnection, a grid operator responsible for the transmission system and energy markets serving Washington, D.C., and 13 states from Virginia to Illinois. Electricity bills are spiking for the region’s more than 65 million residents — primarily due to data centers. Similar pressures are pushing up costs across the Midwest, and in data center hotspots like Georgia and Texas.

Johannes Pfeifenberger, a grid-planning expert and principal with The Brattle Group, has argued for years that grid operators need to embrace VPPs and other innovations to deal with rising demand. Among those options, ​“a VPP is very attractive, whether it’s storage, or controlled EV charging, or heating and air conditioning controls,” he said.

But putting this solution into practice will require grid operators to restructure the rules by which VPPs can directly reduce a data center’s impact on the system, he said. PJM and the Southwest Power Pool, which serves 14 Midwest and Great Plains states, are starting to take on these challenges, but their efforts remain a work in progress.

Data centers may also be limited by the capacity of the power lines and substations at the points they’re seeking to connect to the grid, he said. VPPs that consist of customers scattered across a grid operator’s territory can’t relieve those specific stresses, although other options could, such as data centers colocating at spots with ample grid capacity and building their own generation to fill those gaps, he said.

Guernsey agreed that Voltus’ bring-your-own-capacity construct ​“can only be a solution when capacity is the problem. If the data center is creating an acute distribution level constraint or requires a substation upgrade, that’s a different type of problem.”

Janous thinks data center developers are willing to pay even more than the currently inflated prices for energy if it means they can move faster. Grid operators just have to be willing to allow them to cut deals with companies like Voltus to go do it.

In the face of those pressures, allowing data centers and VPP providers to bring their own capacity is the kind of fast-track effort that could actually succeed at the speed needed, Guernsey said. And it’s a way to make sure that big developers — rather than ordinary consumers — are the ones paying for the energy capacity that data centers require.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/data-centers-in-northern-virginia.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=419f20cfcad02f9cd92d6ca5e30aaec3,N,,2025-10-20 08:08:24.261229

It remains unclear when consideration of new Class VI permit application may resume.","Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry this week signed an Executive Order declaring a moratorium on review of new permit applications for Class VI underground injection wells in the state and directing prioritized review of several pending applications seeking to construct Class VI wells in connection with proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities across the state to proceed.

The order directs the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) to suspend review of any new applications to construct a Class VI well submitted after its effective date and to spend the next 45 days reevaluating the status of the approximately 33 pending permit applications already received. The order prioritizes review of five specified applications for CCS projects in Point Coupee, Vernon, Calcasieu, Cameron, Caldwell and Ascension parishes.

Class VI wells are one of the core components of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities, which capture and liquefy carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sources such as power generation and manufacturing plants for reuse or disposal. The construction of a Class VI well allows CCS facilities to permanently remove their captured CO2emissions from the atmosphere by injecting the liquid CO2into underground geological formations. The resulting reduction in emissions can then be used or sold in carbon markets worldwide to offset emissions increases associated with expanding industrial activities under federal and foreign air permitting regimes.

Louisiana, one of the first states to be granted authority to regulate its own Class VI injection wells by the Environmental Protection Agency in late 2023, is a particularly attractive option for proposed CCS hubs due to its close proximity to manufacturing and energy corridors across the Southeast and its favorable subsurface geology, which features deep saline aquifers and porous rock reservoirs offering ample pore space.

Gov. Landry's order notes that some projections have found that announced CCS projects alone have the potential to generate 17,000 new jobs and $76 billion dollars in capital investments across the state. However, many of these projects have not yet submitted applications to construct the Class VI injection wells necessary for CO2storage. The order could pause the development of these and any new CCS projects in Louisiana indefinitely.

CCS projects in the state have faced increasing scrutiny from parish governments and local community groups, and the order acknowledges the concerns of ""citizens and communities"" while citing recent state legislation requiring the LDENR to give ""substantial consideration"" to local governments' comments on permit applications and other CCS-related actions. The order also points to President Donald Trump's support of ""energy innovation by advancing technologies"" such as CCS and several national executive orders regarding energy, which it finds ""necessitate constant evaluation of Louisiana's own energy policies and laws."" Although CCS technology may ""provide an opportunity to lift citizens of Louisiana out of poverty,"" the order says this must be balanced against the State's ""vital obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and the environment.""

Keep in mind, the order does not provide for an automatic end to the new review moratorium after the LDENR's 45-day review period for pending applications ends. It remains unclear when consideration of new Class VI permit application may resume. In the meantime, the order and related LDENR memoranda make it clear that even pending permits will not be prioritized for review until they have been determined to be complete and compliant with regulatory procedures.

The Phelps Project Development Team is continuing to monitor these new developments.

The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included $4.7 billion for orphaned wells, with West Virginia already receiving $56.2 million through the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Orphaned Wells Program Office.","CHARLESTON — A major natural gas producer is teaming up with the State of West Virginia on a 20-year plan to fund the plugging of more than 1,000 orphaned wells in the state.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey joined Diversified Energy CEO Rusty Hutson, Jr. in Bridgeport Thursday afternoon to announce the creation of the Mountain State Plugging Fund, which they called the nation’s first dedicated financial assurance initiative for retiring oil and gas wells.

“This is a wonderful day,” Morrisey said. “When Rusty first approached me about this, my immediate reaction was this is a triple winner. This is going to strengthen our energy future. It’s going to protect our environment, and it’s going to create good, high-paying jobs for the Mountain State. And you know what? It doesn’t cost the taxpayers one penny.”

“This is a big day,” Hutson said. “It’s an absolute cutting edge program that we’re entering into here with the State of West Virginia…This is the first time it’s ever been accomplished. No state agency has done this up to this point.”

According to Hutson, Diversified Energy will commit $70 million over the next 20 years to the Mountain State Plugging Fund. The funding will be guaranteed by the insurance provider OneNexus, providing up to $650 million of financial protection over time. The Mountain State Plugging Fund will ensure that Diversified Energy’s natural gas and oil wells are safely plugged and retired without expense to West Virginia’s taxpayers.

“What I love about this product that we’re rolling out today is that it outlasts me. It outlasts the governor. It outlasts the (state Department of Environmental Protection),” Hutson said. It’s going to be in place, and it will go on for decades and will take all of the burden off the taxpayers. That was something that was very, very important to us as we looked at it.”

The agreement between the state and Diversified Energy also mandates that the company, through its subsidiary Next LVL Energy, will retire at least 1,500 natural gas and oil wells in the first two decades, or approximately 250 wells per year when fully implemented. Both Morrisey and Hutson said this plan will help create between 50-100 jobs in the oil and natural gas industry with average salaries of $70,000 and help improve the environment.

“That’s a great opportunity for the Mountain State,” Morrisey said. “I’m hopeful that through today’s announcement, this is just going to be the beginning in the series for the Mountain State. Because the truth is today is about the wonderful partnership between the State of West Virginia and Diversified. But there’s still a lot of other wells that need to be plugged.”

According to a 2024 report from West Virginia University’s Bridge Initiative in Science and Technology Policy, Leadership, and Communications, there were more than 6,500 documented orphaned oil and natural gas wells in the state, defined as abandoned wells that have been idle for 12 months or more. However, when factoring in undocumented wells, that number grows to more than 21,000.

When the owner of a well cannot be identified, it becomes the state’s responsibility for plugging the well, but doing so is a costly endeavor. According to the WVU Bridge Initiative, the average cost for plugging a well is approximately $50,000 per well, though that cost can increase depending on the type of well and the terrain.

West Virginia has an Oil and Gas Reclamation Fund where forfeited bonds paid by companies for drilling vertical and horizontal oil and gas wells are deposited. However, there is a question about whether existing bond rates are high enough to avoid putting most of the cost for plugging orphaned wells directly on West Virginia taxpayers through the Department of Environmental Protection.

“I sponsored a couple of little bills through the Legislature that created little trickles of money for well plugging. So, it’s an issue that I was on a long time ago,” said Del. Bill Anderson, R-Wood, chairman of the House Energy and Public Works Committee.

“I think this is a monumental step forward,” Anderson continued. “It is a basically private industry stepping up to partner with our DEP to deal with the long-term environmental problems that have legacy issues that have been handed to us for more than 100 years. Anything we can do to improve well plugging and improve the quality of everything in the state, I am behind.”

Some orphaned wells have been sitting abandoned for decades, causing air pollution through methane emissions, or groundwater contamination from the slow leaking of oil and other contaminants.

Earlier this year, Morrisey signed House Bill 3336, creating an inexpensive way to cap abandoned wells. The bill allows oil and natural gas companies to plug abandoned wells by piercing the outer casing and pumping cement into the well. Prior to the passage of HB 3336, companies were required to remove most of a well’s equipment.

“I was happy to sponsor the bill, and I think this is a great continuation of that effort,” said Del. Mark Zatezalo, R-Hancock, the vice chairman of the House Energy and Public Works Committee. “If we can pull more people into this type of a program, it can only be a benefit.

“I don’t know how many of you know, but there are thousands of wells in the state that are abandoned,” Zatezalo continued. “You can argue how much environmental damage they do, but the fact that they’re open is something that you cannot overlook. The more aggressive we are with that, the better off we’re going to be.”

West Virginia has also received some federal funding for capping orphaned wells.

The federal incentive program for electric vehicle buyers has come to an end. As of September 30, 2025, the US government officially stopped funding your next electric car, causing concern among automakers about a sharp drop in demand.

State Alternatives

However, this does not necessarily mean a complete absence of any assistance. Depending on where you live, your state may still support you with its own tax credit scheme.

Who Continues to Support?

Some states remain extremely tight-fisted with funds, meaning there is no universal discount like the former federal assistance of $7,500. According to new data from the Tax Foundation, the situation at the state level resembles a patchwork mosaic of benefits, penalties, and bureaucracy.

While some states still roll out the red carpet for electric vehicles, others quietly burden owners with new registration fees to compensate for lost fuel tax revenue, highlighting the differing attitudes towards green policy across the country.

Ford and General Motors canceled an electric vehicle tax credit loophole after allegations of fraud with taxpayer funds.

Several states remain firmly on the buyer’s side, including Colorado, which from November this year will provide subsidies of up to $9,000 to low- and middle-income families who trade in an old gasoline car for a new electric vehicle, and up to $6,000 for a supported one.

Oregon and Maine offer credits of $7,500, Oklahoma provides up to $5,500, and Connecticut and Vermont will reduce the price of your electric vehicle by $5,000. Illinois, Kansas, and New Jersey make $4,000 available, and various other states will add from $1,500 to $3,500 to encourage you to switch to electric transport.

Where Electric Vehicles Cost More

Then come the less friendly states. Georgia has no electric vehicle incentives at all, and drivers pay $235 per year just to register their electric vehicle. Indiana is likely even worse: there are also no electric vehicle incentives, a $230 fee is charged for registering such a vehicle, and $77 for registering a hybrid.

Perhaps unexpectedly, given its history of leadership on environmental issues, California no longer offers state assistance to electric vehicle buyers. Governor Gavin Newsom recently stated that it is currently economically unviable to provide assistance, although his office later suggested that a scheme could be introduced next year.

Some states not only rely on electric vehicle registration fees to help compensate for lost gasoline sales revenue but also add a tax on the cost of charging at public charging stations. Such states include Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, and Oklahoma, reports the Tax Foundation, also noting a flaw in their plan: drivers who charge at home avoid this fee.

Tax Foundation

We have simplified this table from the Tax Foundation. The original contains notes about which states offer other assistance, such as sales tax exemptions or a mileage-based taxation option instead of paying a registration tax.

The conclusion is that the cancellation of federal tax credits by the government does not necessarily mean you can no longer afford this electric vehicle. You just need to check what position your state takes on this issue. The difference in approaches between states can be very significant – from thousands of dollars in assistance to hundreds of dollars in additional annual costs, making geographic location one of the key factors when buying electric transport in modern conditions.",https://topgir.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4tgf3qrved-cgv4refdv-1024x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:06:49.471415

Alberta’s oil sands sector is one of Canada’s most important industries — and also one of its most misunderstood.

Here are five common myths, and the facts behind them.

Myth: Oil sands emissions are unchecked

Reality: Oil sands emissions are strictly regulated and monitored. Producers are making improvements through innovation and efficiency.

The sector’s average emissions per barrel – already on par with the average oil consumed in the United States, according to S&P Global – continue to go down.

The province reports that oil sands emissions per barrel declined by 26 per cent per barrel from 2012 to 2023. At the same time, production increased by 96 per cent.

Analysts with S&P Global call this a “structural change” for the industry where production growth is beginning to rise faster than emissions growth.

The firm continues to anticipate a decrease in total oil sands emissions within the next few years.

The Pathways Alliance — companies representing about 95 per cent of oil sands activity — aims to significantly cut emissions from production through a major carbon capture and storage (CCS) project and other innovations.

Myth: There is no demand for oil sands production

Reality: Demand for Canadian oil – which primarily comes from the oil sands – is strong and rising.

Today, America imports more than 80 per cent more oil from Canada than it did in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

New global customers also now have access to Canadian oil thanks to the opening of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in 2024.

Exports to countries outside the U.S. increased by 180 per cent since the project went into service, reaching a record 525,000 barrels per day in July 2025, according to the Canada Energy Regulator.

The world’s appetite for oil keeps growing — and it’s not stopping anytime soon.

According to the latest EIA projections, the world will consume about 120 million barrels per day of oil and petroleum liquids in 2050, up from about 104 million barrels per day today.

Myth: Oil sands projects cost too much

Reality: Operating oil sands projects deliver some of the lowest-cost oil in North America, according to Enverus Intelligence Research.

Unlike U.S. shale plays, oil sands production is a long-life, low-decline “manufacturing” process without the treadmill of ongoing investment in new drilling, according to BMO Capital Markets.

Vast oil sands reserves support mining projects with no drilling, and the standard SAGD drilling method involves about 60 per cent fewer wells than the average shale play, BMO says.

After initial investment, Enverus says oil sands projects typically break even at less than US$50 per barrel WTI.

Myth: Indigenous communities don’t support the oil sands

Reality: Indigenous communities play an important role in the oil sands sector through community agreements, business contracts and, increasingly, project equity ownership.

Oil sands producers spent an average of $1.8 billion per year with 180 Indigenous-affiliated vendors between 2021 and 2023, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

Indigenous communities are now owners of key projects that support the oil sands, including Suncor Energy’s East Tank Farm (49 per cent owned by two communities); the Northern Courier pipeline system (14 per cent owned by eight communities); and the Athabasca Trunkline, seven operating Enbridge oil sands pipelines (~12 per cent owned by 23 communities).

These partnerships strengthen Indigenous communities with long-term revenue, helping build economic reconciliation.

Myth: Oil sands development only benefits people in Alberta

Reality: Oil sands development benefits Canadians across the country through reliable energy supply, jobs, taxes and government revenues that help pay for services like roads, schools and hospitals.

The sector has contributed approximately $1 trillion to the Canadian economy over the past 25 years, according to analysis by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute (MLI).

That reflects total direct spending — including capital investment, operating costs, taxes and royalties — not profits or dividends for shareholders.

More than 2,300 companies outside of Alberta have had direct business with the oilsands, including over 1,300 in Ontario and almost 600 in Quebec, MLI said.

The transition from current pilot-scale operations to commercial us domestic antimony production restart involves multiple phases requiring careful coordination of technical, financial, and regulatory milestones.","The United States faces a critical vulnerability in its antimony supply chain that threatens both national security and economic stability. This strategic mineral, essential for defense applications and clean energy technologies, has left America entirely dependent on foreign sources since 2001, creating an urgent imperative for us domestic antimony production restart revival.

Critical Mineral Classification and National Security Implications

Antimony earned its place on the US Critical Minerals List in 2018 under Executive Order 13817, with reaffirmation in 2022 by the US Geological Survey. This designation reflects the mineral's dual nature of supply vulnerability and economic importance. The current 100% import dependency exposes American industries to geopolitical risks and supply disruptions that could cripple essential manufacturing sectors.

China's dominance in global antimony production, controlling approximately 55% of worldwide output at 60,000 metric tons annually, became particularly concerning following Beijing's announcement of export licensing requirements in August 2024. These restrictions, effective September 15, 2024, mirror previous Chinese actions with rare earth elements and demonstrated how quickly critical mineral access can become weaponized.

The strategic implications extend beyond immediate supply concerns. Furthermore, antimony price volatility following China's export control announcement saw costs surge from approximately $11,000 per metric ton in January 2024 to over $22,000 per metric ton by September 2024, representing a 100% increase that rippled through American manufacturing sectors.

Defense Industry Dependencies and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Military applications represent some of the most critical uses for antimony, with stringent quality requirements that cannot be easily substituted. The Department of Defense relies on antimony for multiple applications:

Ammunition manufacturing: Lead-antimony alloys containing 3-6% antimony provide necessary hardness for bullets and projectiles

Aircraft safety systems: Antimony trioxide serves as a flame retardant in military aircraft interior panels and wiring systems

Electronic warfare equipment: Antimony-based semiconductors enable night vision and infrared detection capabilities

The Pentagon's antimony consumption, while classified in specific quantities, likely reaches hundreds of metric tons annually for ammunition alone. This dependency on foreign sources creates operational risks that extend far beyond economic considerations, particularly in light of recent critical minerals order developments, potentially compromising military readiness and technological superiority.

Clean Energy Manufacturing Requirements

America's clean energy transition amplifies antimony demand across multiple sectors. Grid-scale energy storage systems increasingly rely on advanced lead-acid batteries containing 2-5% antimony to improve charging characteristics and operational longevity. Moreover, solar panel manufacturing requires antimony trioxide as a catalyst in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) production for protective backsheets.

The Inflation Reduction Act's emphasis on domestic clean energy manufacturing makes foreign antimony dependency particularly problematic. As battery production scales to support electric vehicle adoption and grid storage deployment, antimony requirements will grow substantially, making current import vulnerabilities increasingly untenable.

How Long Has America Relied on Foreign Antimony Sources?

America's antimony independence ended abruptly in 2001 with the closure of the Sunshine Mine in Idaho, marking the beginning of a 24-year period of complete foreign dependency that only recently showed signs of reversal.

The 2001 Sunshine Mine Closure and Its Lasting Impact

The Sunshine Mine's closure represented more than just another mining operation ending. As the last domestic antimony producer, generating 490 metric tons in its final year of operation, its shutdown eliminated America's ability to produce this critical mineral domestically. The closure resulted from a combination of factors including years of low commodity prices, foreign competition, and the lingering effects of the devastating 1972 fire that killed 91 miners.

Prior to closure, the mine had provided a crucial buffer against supply disruptions, but declining profitability made operations unsustainable. Foreign producers, particularly from China, offered antimony at prices that American operations could not match while maintaining profitable margins.

Import Dependency Statistics and Primary Source Countries

The evolution of American antimony dependency tells a story of gradual erosion followed by complete reliance on foreign sources:

Historical Dependency Timeline:

1980s: United States produced approximately 30% of domestic antimony needs

1990s: Domestic production declined to less than 10% of consumption

2001-present: Zero domestic mine production, 100% import reliant

Current import sources (2020-2023 average) reveal concerning concentration risks:

Source Country Import Share Annual Volume (MT) Strategic Risk Level China 35% ~12,000 High Belgium 24% ~8,400 Medium India 14% ~4,900 Medium Vietnam 8% ~2,800 Medium Others 19% ~6,650 Variable

Belgium's significant share represents processed antimony rather than primary production, as the country refines Chinese and other foreign concentrates. Consequently, actual dependency on Chinese sources exceeds the direct 35% figure.

Strategic Stockpile Depletion Concerns

The National Defense Stockpile previously provided a buffer against supply disruptions, holding approximately 27,000 metric tons of antimony during the 1990s. However, authorized sales reduced these holdings to less than 5,000 metric tons by 2020, eliminating much of America's strategic reserve capacity.

This depletion occurred during the same period when domestic production ceased, creating a perfect storm of vulnerability. Current stockpile levels provide minimal buffer against extended supply disruptions, particularly given annual US consumption of approximately 32,000-35,000 metric tons.

Which Companies Are Leading the US Domestic Antimony Production Revival?

The renaissance of American antimony production centers around three key players, each bringing distinct capabilities and timelines to market restoration efforts.

Locksley Resources' Mojave Desert Breakthrough

Australian-listed Locksley Resources (ASX: LKY) achieved a historic milestone in October 2025 by producing the first US-made antimony ingot in 24 years from their Mojave Desert operation in California. This breakthrough validates the complete mine-to-metal supply chain concept using domestically sourced ore refined at Hazen Research's metallurgical facilities in Colorado.

Key Locksley Achievements:

Successfully demonstrated ore extraction to refined metal production

Validated processing methodology for antimony trisulfide and trioxide production

Established partnership framework for scaling to commercial operations

Advanced toward pilot-scale production to confirm metallurgical recoveries

CEO Kerrie Matthews characterised this achievement as proof that sustainable commercial supply chains supporting America's industrial and defense sectors are not only possible but already underway. The company's focus now shifts from concept validation to commercial scaling, working closely with industry partners to ensure product specifications meet stringent US defense and industrial standards.

GreenMet, serving as Locksley's US-based advisor, provides crucial support for permitting and funding initiatives. CEO Drew Horn positioned Locksley as a pioneer in rebuilding America's antimony supply chain, representing precisely the outcome policymakers and industry leaders have sought for critical minerals domestic production.

United States Antimony Corporation's Integrated Operations

While specific current operational details require independent verification, United States Antimony Corporation represents another potential pillar in domestic antimony revival through integrated mining and processing capabilities. The company's approach focuses on creating vertically integrated operations from mine extraction through refined product delivery.

Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining's Revival Plans

Perhaps the most ambitious domestic antimony revival comes from Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining, planning to restart operations at the historic Idaho site where American antimony production originally ended. The private company's projections outline aggressive market capture goals:

Sunshine Revival Timeline:

2028 Target: Supply 40% of US annual antimony demand

2031 Goal: Potentially capture 80% of domestic market share

Infrastructure: Development of the country's only large-scale permitted antimony refinery

These projections, if realised, would dramatically alter America's antimony supply security. Capturing 40% of domestic demand by 2028 would represent approximately 13,000-14,000 metric tons annually, while 80% market share would reach 26,000-28,000 metric tons based on current consumption levels.

What Are the Technical Challenges in Restarting Domestic Production?

Reviving American antimony production after 24 years presents complex metallurgical, operational, and quality control challenges that extend far beyond simply reopening closed facilities.

Metallurgical Recovery Optimisation

Antimony typically occurs as stibnite (Sb2S3), requiring sophisticated processing to achieve commercial-grade purity levels. Traditional processing involves roasting stibnite to antimony trioxide, followed by carbon reduction to metallic antimony. Recovery rates typically range from 85-95% depending on ore characteristics and processing methodology.

Locksley's breakthrough with Hazen Research demonstrates successful processing methodology, but scaling from proof-of-concept to commercial volumes requires extensive optimisation. Key technical parameters include:

Temperature control: Precise roasting temperatures to maximise recovery while minimising impurities

Atmosphere management: Controlling oxidising conditions during processing stages

Impurity removal: Achieving defence-grade specifications requiring 99.5% minimum purity

Energy efficiency: Optimising fuel consumption and processing costs for commercial viability

Processing Efficiency Scaling Requirements

Moving from pilot-scale to commercial production presents exponential complexity increases. Processing facilities must maintain consistent quality while handling significantly larger ore volumes. Critical scaling factors include:

Infrastructure Requirements:

Ore handling and preparation systems capable of processing hundreds of tons daily

Roasting furnaces with precise temperature and atmosphere control

Refining capabilities to remove arsenic, lead, and copper impurities

Environmental controls for sulfur dioxide emissions management

Product Quality Standards for Defence Applications

Defence applications demand the highest antimony purity levels, typically requiring 99.5% minimum purity for metallic antimony and 99.0% minimum for antimony trioxide. These specifications leave minimal margin for processing variations, requiring sophisticated quality control systems.

Critical Quality Parameters:

Arsenic content below 0.06% for flame retardant applications

Controlled lead and copper impurities for battery alloy applications

Consistent particle size distribution for industrial applications

Trace element analysis meeting military specifications

How Does Domestic Production Compare to Global Supply Chains?

American antimony production revival occurs within a global market dominated by established players offering significant cost advantages and proven supply chains.

China's Market Dominance and Export Restrictions

China's 60,000 metric tons annual production represents 55% of global antimony output, creating overwhelming market influence. Chinese producers benefit from multiple competitive advantages:

Lower labour costs: Significantly reduced operational expenses compared to US standards

Established infrastructure: Decades of processing facility development and optimisation

Economies of scale: Large-volume production spreading fixed costs across higher output

Integrated supply chains: Vertical integration from mining through refined product delivery

China's August 2024 export licensing requirements demonstrate how quickly supply chains can be disrupted. These controls, similar to previous rare earth restrictions, signal Beijing's willingness to use antimony as a geopolitical tool.

Alternative International Sources and Their Limitations

Beyond China, global antimony production comes from several countries with varying degrees of supply reliability:

Country Annual Production (MT) Market Share Supply Reliability Russia 18,000 16% Low (sanctions) Tajikistan 13,000 12% Medium Myanmar 10,000 9% Low (instability) Others 9,000 8% Variable

Russia's production faces ongoing sanctions complications, while Myanmar's political instability creates supply uncertainty. Tajikistan offers more reliable access but limited production scale. These alternatives cannot fully replace Chinese supplies without significant market disruption.

Cost Competitiveness Analysis

American antimony production faces substantial cost challenges compared to established international suppliers. Key cost factors include:

US Production Disadvantages:

Higher labour costs reflecting American wage standards

Stringent environmental compliance requirements increasing operational expenses

New infrastructure capital requirements for facility development

Smaller initial production scales limiting cost distribution advantages

Offsetting Advantages:

Transportation cost savings eliminating $500-800 per metric ton shipping expenses

Supply chain security premium valued by defence contractors

Reduced inventory carrying costs from shorter supply chains

Potential government support through various incentive programmes

What Government Policies Support Antimony Production Restart?

Federal policy frameworks provide multiple pathways for supporting domestic antimony production revival through financial incentives, regulatory streamlining, and strategic procurement programmes.

Critical Minerals List Designation Impact

Antimony's inclusion on the US Critical Minerals List since 2018, reaffirmed in 2022, unlocks access to various federal support mechanisms. This designation enables:

Expedited permitting: FAST-41 streamlined environmental review processes

Financial incentives: Access to advanced manufacturing production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act

Loan guarantees: Department of Energy Title XVII authority for critical mineral projects

Research support: Federal funding for metallurgical and processing research initiatives

Defence Production Act Potential Applications

The Defence Production Act (DPA) Title III provides DOD authority to financially support domestic critical material production. While no specific antimony funding has been publicly announced as of late 2024, the precedent exists through $285 million in DPA Title III funding awarded for rare earth processing in 2023.

Potential DPA Support Mechanisms:

Purchase commitments providing revenue certainty for new operations

Infrastructure development funding for processing facilities

Technology development grants for metallurgical optimisation

Workforce training support for specialised mining and processing skills

America's clean energy transition creates expanding antimony demand across multiple technologies essential for grid modernisation and renewable energy deployment.

Key Clean Energy Applications:

Grid storage batteries: Advanced lead-acid batteries containing 2-5% antimony for improved charging characteristics

Solar panel manufacturing: Antimony trioxide catalyst in PET backsheet production

Wind turbine components: Flame-retardant applications in electrical systems and control units

Electric vehicle charging: Grid-connected systems requiring reliable battery storage capabilities

As battery manufacturing scales to support the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy goals, antimony requirements will grow substantially, making domestic supply increasingly valuable for supply chain security through energy transition security.

Industrial Manufacturing Sectors

Beyond defence and energy applications, antimony serves essential roles across diverse industrial sectors representing significant market opportunities.

Primary Industrial Uses (2023 consumption breakdown):

Flame retardants: 45% of US antimony consumption in plastics, textiles, and electronics

Lead-acid batteries: 25% for automotive and industrial applications

Chemicals and ceramics: 15% for catalyst and glass production applications

Other applications: 15% including paints, adhesives, and specialised alloys

The flame retardant market alone represents approximately 15,000-16,000 metric tons annually, with applications ranging from building materials to consumer electronics requiring consistent supply reliability.

What Are the Environmental Considerations for Domestic Mining?

Restarting antimony production requires navigating complex environmental regulations while addressing community concerns about mining impacts and long-term sustainability.

Permitting Process Requirements

Antimony mining operations face comprehensive federal and state environmental review processes that can extend project timelines significantly. Key regulatory requirements include:

Federal Oversight:

Environmental Impact Statements under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

Clean Air Act permits for processing facility emissions

Clean Water Act compliance for mine water management

Endangered Species Act consultations for habitat impacts

State-Level Requirements:

Mining permits and reclamation bonding

Air quality permits for roasting and smelting operations

Water discharge permits and groundwater protection plans

Waste management approvals for processing residues

The FAST-41 permitting process available to critical mineral projects can streamline some review timelines, but comprehensive environmental compliance remains essential for project success in line with domestic production order requirements.

Environmental Impact Mitigation Strategies

Modern antimony processing requires sophisticated environmental controls to meet current regulatory standards while maintaining community acceptance.

Critical Environmental Controls:

Air emissions: Sulfur dioxide capture systems for roasting operations preventing acid rain formation

Water management: Closed-loop processing systems minimising freshwater consumption and discharge

Waste handling: Safe storage and disposal of processing residues containing trace heavy metals

Habitat protection: Minimising surface disturbance and implementing progressive reclamation programmes

Community Engagement and Stakeholder Concerns

Successful antimony production revival requires proactive engagement with local communities, indigenous tribes, and environmental organisations. Key stakeholder concerns include:

Economic benefits: Local employment opportunities and tax revenue generation

Environmental protection: Long-term impacts on air quality, water resources, and wildlife habitat

Cultural considerations: Protection of historical sites and traditional land uses

Transportation impacts: Increased truck traffic and infrastructure wear on local roads

How Will Domestic Production Affect Antimony Market Pricing?

American antimony production revival will introduce new pricing dynamics while potentially stabilising supply costs for domestic consumers.

Current Import Price Volatility Factors

Antimony pricing demonstrates extreme volatility driven by geopolitical events and supply disruptions. The 100% price increase from $11,000 to $22,000 per metric ton following China's export control announcement illustrates this vulnerability.

Primary Volatility Drivers:

Geopolitical tensions: Trade disputes and export restrictions create sudden supply gaps

Transportation costs: Shipping expenses from China add $500-800 per metric ton

Currency fluctuations: Dollar strength affects import costs from various suppliers

Inventory speculation: Market participants adjusting stocks based on supply concerns

Domestic Production Cost Structure Analysis

American antimony production will likely operate at higher base costs than Chinese competitors but offer offsetting advantages through supply security and transportation savings.

Expected Cost Components:

Mining operations: Higher labour costs offset by modern equipment efficiency

Processing facilities: Substantial capital requirements but potential economies from integrated operations

Environmental compliance: Additional costs for emission controls and waste management

Transportation savings: Elimination of international shipping and reduced inventory requirements

Long-term Price Stabilisation Projections

Domestic production capacity representing 40-80% of US demand by 2031 could significantly stabilise antimony pricing by reducing import dependency and providing supply security.

Stabilisation Mechanisms:

Supply diversification: Reduced reliance on single-source imports

Strategic buffering: Domestic production providing emergency supply capacity

Contract pricing: Long-term supply agreements with defence contractors

Market competition: Domestic alternatives constraining import price volatility

Economic Impact Projections:

Estimated jobs created: 500-1,500 direct positions across mining and processing operations

Regional investment: $50-100 million initial capital requirements for facility development

Import substitution value: $200+ million annually based on current consumption levels

A case before Michigan's energy regulators could set the course for the construction of new data centers across Michigan.
If data centers use water to cool their computer systems via evaporation, that means the water does not necessarily return to the watershed.
Still, even a few data centers could reshape a utility's operations by surging demand for electricity.
They, along with the Michigan Attorney General's office, consumer advocacy groups and a data center industry group, are among those who have intervened in Consumers' data center case before the MPSC.","Technology companies have set their sights on vast swaths of land in Michigan in their race to build data centers — energy-hungry facilities that power artificial intelligence, movie streaming, web browsing and other online tools.

Leaders of both DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, the state's two major regulated, investor-owned utilities, have told shareholders that multiple large data centers have expressed interest in building in Michigan. If built, those data centers would significantly increase demand for energy and lead the companies to build more electric sources, the company leaders said.

As utility leaders field inquiries from the tech sector, environmental groups and some ratepayers fear rapid data center development could send their electric bills skyrocketing and hamper the state's transition away from fossil fuels.

""There is a real risk here that if it's done improperly, residential customers will pay for the AI boom, to support power needs (of tech companies), without a clear benefit,"" said Daniel Abrams, senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

""This is a really important moment in time.""

Tech company executives, other consumers and analysts noted that data centers are critical to powering increasing demands in the digital economy and can fuel the creation of good-paying jobs.

""States that can effectively plan, manage, and mitigate the risks of data center growth stand to unlock millions, perhaps even billions, of dollars in direct and indirect growth. At the same time, they can create high-paying jobs and establish themselves as leading digital-infrastructure hubs,"" according to an August report by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co.

Already, there are at least 50 data centers operating in Michigan, according to Data Center Map, an online database tracking the facilities. More are in various stages of development.

At least three data centers are planned in Washtenaw County alone, including a $1.25 billion ""high performance computational facility"" proposed by the University of Michigan and Los Alamos National Laboratory. There is another in Saline Township that was approved after its developer, Related Digital, sued the town over officials' initial decision to oppose its rezoning request.

Another facility is proposed in Livingston County's Howell Township. The Livingston County Planning Commission is scheduled to hear a request to rezone 25 parcels from the developer in November, township zoning administrator Jonathan Hohenstein said. The company behind the development told the township it would disclose itself once a plan is approved, according to its rezoning request.

A case before Michigan's energy regulators could set the course for the construction of new data centers across Michigan.

Consumers Energy asked the Michigan Public Service Commission for permission to add provisions specific to data centers to the tariffs, or contracts, the company drafts with industrial customers. The company wants to require new data centers to operate for at least 15 years, use at least 80% of the energy they say they will use and pay a fee for ending contracts early.

Those measures would help avoid a scenario in which Consumers Energy builds out its grid to service a promised data center that only operates for a year, leaving the company with power-generating infrastructure that nobody needs, but everybody has to pay for.

""This proposal is designed to protect customers from potential stranded costs associated with data center loads,"" Consumers spokesman Brian Wheeler said in an emailed statement. ""Consumers Energy is planning to serve data centers on MPSC-approved, cost of service based rates, which will ensure they pay the costs of providing service to them.""

Environmental groups said Consumers Energy's proposal doesn't go far enough to protect ratepayers and ensure the state continues its movement toward powering the grid with clean energy. In contrast, an industry group representing data center owners and operators contended the proposal would pull the rug out from under the burgeoning industry and send development to other states.

The ""extreme recommendations … would force large load customers to bear an intolerable level of risk,"" wrote the attorneys for the Data Center Coalition, a Virginia-based group of data center owners and operators, in a September filing to the Public Service Commission.

Environmental groups have also raised concerns about data centers' water use. Computers get hot, and cooling them requires using either water or electricity. The Alliance for the Great Lakes, a Chicago nonprofit that advocates for Great Lakes protection, issued a report in August that said large data centers can use each day between 1 million gallons — about as much as 12,000 Americans use in a day — and 5 million gallons.

If data centers use water to cool their computer systems via evaporation, that means the water does not necessarily return to the watershed. Other cooling methods release contaminants or use more electricity, according to the report.

The Alliance for Great Lakes recommended that the states conduct water demand studies to understand their supply, require data centers to disclose their expected water use and report the amount of water they actually use.

""Without careful planning, it could have unintended consequences, like depleting groundwater availability in existing private drinking water wells and wells used for agricultural irrigation,"" the report stated.

Centers may require doubling of power supply

The potential expansion of electricity demand as a result of data center development is staggering. The facilities need power to operate their computational equipment as well as keep the facility cool, a task that can also be done using water.

Consumers Energy alone has fielded so many inquiries from data center developers that the utility would have to nearly triple its peak load — the amount of energy it takes to supply its customers at times of maximum demand — if each request came to fruition. In its application for an amended tariff, Consumers said the company had fielded inquiries that totaled more than 15 gigawatts of electric load. This means the peak load would reach 23 gigawatts, up from Consumers' current peak load of about 8 gigawatts.

DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris told shareholders in July that the company is in ""advanced discussions"" with multiple large data centers for more than three gigawatts of new load and is in ""ongoing discussions"" with multiple other data center operators for an additional four gigawatts. The utility's current peak load is approximately 10 gigawatts.

Data center developers want to take advantage of the exemption on sales and use taxes Michigan lawmakers approved last year, which lasts through 2028, Harris said.

It isn't likely that every tech company inquiry about locating a data center in a utility's service territory will lead to a data center actually coming online. Analysts agree that tech companies are probably sending inquiries to many utility companies in multiple states. Still, even a few data centers could reshape a utility's operations by surging demand for electricity.

A surge in demand means a surge in the development of energy production and storage, which requires a surge in money.

The stakes are high. Data centers use exorbitant amounts of energy, so adding one to a utility's service territory is expensive. The Michigan Attorney General's Office estimated Consumers Energy would have to spend nearly $500 million to serve a new 100-megawatt data center, according to filings submitted to the Public Service Commission.

The costs are largely in two categories: building enough new power sources to supply the data center, which state attorneys estimate would cost approximately $400 million, and connecting the data center to Consumers' transmission grid, which they estimated would cost $46.5 million and $96 million.

That brings the final estimated tally for a single, 100-megawatt data center to between $446.5 million and $496 million.

Those estimates are for a hypothetical 100 megawatt data center. Consumers Energy announced this summer it had signed an agreement to connect a data center that could add up to 1 gigawatt of demand — an order of magnitude larger than the one state attorneys estimated would cost almost $500 million to put on the grid.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said a 1-gigawatt data center would demand as much energy as almost 1 million U.S. homes.

That's why the details in the tariff case being hashed out before the Public Service Commission are important, said Lee Shaver, senior energy analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Massachusetts nonprofit that advocates for science-based public policy.

""The other regulated utilities are going to be paying attention, and they might file something similar,"" Shaver said. ""Data centers are also watching.""

DTE Energy has not filed a tariff case but is monitoring how other utilities and public service commissions address data center rates, spokesman Ryan Lowry said.

DTE has excess capacity and could begin to serve some data centers quickly with its mix of electricity from renewable sources, natural gas and battery storage, Lowry said. The company could have to build new energy generation sources depending on data center demand, he said.

DTE plans to retire the coal-fired Monroe Power Plant in 2032. The company is exploring options for replacing that baseload power by expanding its nuclear power fleet, which currently includes just the Fermi 2 plant in Frenchtown Township, as well as expanding its use of natural gas paired with carbon capture and sequestration, Lowry said.

Data center groups object to contract terms

Environmental groups, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, want to ensure large data centers don't affect the cost or reliability of electricity in Michigan or extend the use of fossil fuels to power the grid, Shaver said. They, along with the Michigan Attorney General's office, consumer advocacy groups and a data center industry group, are among those who have intervened in Consumers' data center case before the MPSC.

The environmental groups are pushing the Public Service Commission to require Consumers to factor clean energy into their agreements with data centers and require Consumers to prioritize serving data centers that supply some of their own clean electricity and can limit the amount of power on days when demand is high. That will help limit how much electricity Consumers would have to supply on peak-demand days.

The groups also are advocating for the commission to require data centers to generate some of their own clean electricity or pay for the electricity sources utilities build to serve them, Shaver said.

""If the utilities aren't doing a good job allocating costs in their rates, every time they file for increased rates, that fixed portion of residential customers' bill is going to go up, and they're going to be subsidizing a data center,"" Shaver said. ""That becomes a huge issue if a data center doesn’t materialize. Utility builds all the infrastructure, then the customer never comes, then everyone else is left holding the bag.""

The Michigan Attorney General's Office similarly is pushing the commission to require more stringent terms for data centers. The Attorney General's Office wants Consumers' tariffs to apply to smaller data centers than the utility company proposed and to require data center developers to pay more of the cost of project planning, new energy generation and connection.

State attorneys also estimated what it would cost Consumers to serve a new, 100-megawatt data center — nearly $500 million, according to filings submitted to the commission. Consumers' proposed tariff terms would not guarantee that a data center customer makes up for those upfront costs, the state attorneys argued in their initial brief.

""Under Consumers’ proposed tariff amendments, the guaranteed revenue from new data center customers would not meet even the non-complete cost estimate outlined above,"" the Attorney General's Office wrote.

The Data Center Coalition noted in its September filing that the terms Consumers proposed are ""a striking departure from the status quo."" Other industrial customers are not obligated to agree to such terms, the coalition said.

While the coalition's attorneys said they generally agree to making those commitments, they said Consumers, the commission staff and environmental groups' proposals go too far and would make Michigan an outlier compared with other states.

""This would discourage data centers and other large loads from locating in the Company’s service territory, undermining the legislature's clear intent when it enacted a sales and use tax exemption for data centers late last year.""

California oil production has been waning since the 1980s and has more recently been pinched by the push for cleaner forms of energy.","Thousands flock to its parade of cowboys on horseback, antique cars and floats featuring oil pumps -- a hat tip to the Wild West of yore.

This year, nine months into Donald Trump's second term, the tone has shifted from reminiscence to renaissance.

Shrugging off climate change concerns, the US president has embraced fossil fuels with a stated goal of ""unleashing American energy"" and removing ""impediments"" to domestic energy production.

Some of Taft's 7,000 residents are anticipating a comeback for the petroleum industry in California, which has pledged to abandon oil drilling by 2045 to meet its climate goals.

""I'm 100 percent satisfied with President Trump,"" Buddy Binkley told AFP, a minority view in a heavily Democratic state. ""And as for the state of California, I think he's putting a nice pressure on them to hopefully turn around their prejudice against oil.""

The 64-year-old retired maintenance supervisor with oil company Chevron sported a red cap with the words ""Make Oil Great Again,"" a play on Trump's MAGA motto and a slogan featured on several parade floats.

""The oil industry in California is suffering due to political reasons,"" Binkley said. But with Trump in power, ""I think it may go back the way it was.""

'Great hopes'

Located about 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Los Angeles, Taft was founded in 1910 atop California's most extensive oil field.

Today, Kern County -- where Taft is located -- contributes more than 70 percent of California's total oil production. Its rural landscape is dotted with thousands of oil pumps.

A giant wooden oil derrick serves as a central landmark in Taft, which finances its schools, fire department and police force with oil revenues.

Festival-goers can compete for the title of best welder, crane operator or backhoe loader -- or be crowned the ""Oildorado Queen.""

Despite its pageantry and pride, the town is in decline.

California oil production has been waning since the 1980s and has more recently been pinched by the push for cleaner forms of energy. Some of the town's residents have moved to Texas, where drilling is less regulated.

Many in Taft are delighted that Trump has pulled out of the Paris climate accord and removed obstacles to drilling on federal lands while handing out billions in tax breaks for the oil industry.

""I have great hopes,"" said Dave Noerr, Taft's mayor. ""We have all the raw materials. We had the wrong direction, now we have leadership that is going to unleash the possibilities.""

'Stuck in the past'

Trump's administration has slashed federal funding for renewable energy and climate science, and he wants to strip the Environmental Protection Agency of its power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Like the president, Noerr is a skeptic of ""quote, unquote, climate change.""

""We need to question the narrative, and we need to update those things with the existing science,"" he said.

Yet California is increasingly vulnerable to the extreme weather produced by climate change. Earlier this year, 31 people in the Los Angeles area died in fires spread by hurricane-force gusts of 160 km/h (100 miles per hour).

""If everyone around the world behaved like the US, the world would be on pace for four degrees centigrade of global warming by 2100,"" said Paasha Mahdavi, a political scientist specializing in environmental policy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Agriculture remains the top employer in Kern County, and ""would be dramatically affected by increased incidence of drought, and unprecedented heat waves that are already hitting the region,"" he added.

That worries Taylor Pritchett, a 31-year-old dog groomer in Taft who frets about air pollution in the area.

""If I were to have a child, I wouldn't want to raise them in Kern County,"" she said. ""I would like to go somewhere cleaner.""

She believes that ""we need to get away from fossil fuels."" But in Taft, she acknowledged, ""we're stuck in the past a little bit, you know, like, very unwilling to change.""

Zacks Investment Research","Tesla Earnings Are Due Wednesday

Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Tesla (TSLA), the worldwide electric vehicle (EV) leader and a dynamic technology innovator, will report third-quarter 2025 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, October 22nd. Though Tesla has been one of the top-performing stocks since its IPO in July 2010 (with a 34,000% return), the stock has taken investors on a wild ride over the past few years. Namely, Tesla has had to weather new tariff policies, a slowing EV market, higher interest rates, and increased competition. Additionally, Tesla and its iconic but controversial CEO, Elon Musk, have faced intense political backlash from both sides of the political aisle. Despite its many challenges, TSLA shares are up a robust 93% over the past six months.

Tesla EPS Preview

Below are some key details to know ahead of Tesla’s earnings:

Tesla Consensus Analyst Estimates

Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest tepid sales growth and negative EPS growth until 2026. Wall Street expects Q3 revenue of $26.45B (+5.05%), with EPS of $0.53 (-26.39%).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Tesla EPS Surprise History

Tesla has delivered spotty earnings results recently. Despite tempered Tesla analyst expectations, Tesla has missed expectations in six of the past ten quarters.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Meanwhile, Tesla has missed analyst expectations by an average of 3.65% over the past four quarters.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

TSLA Expected Move

The options market implies a potential move of +/- $37.48 or an 8.53% implied move. Tesla has had an average move of +/- 10.53% over the past eight quarters. TSLA shares have been higher the day after EPS 50% of the time over that time.

TSLA Technical View

After breaking out from a low-level base structure in September, TSLA shares are coiling in a classic bull flag pattern. If Tesla exceeds expectations, the stock should make a run at its previous all-time high of $488. Should TSLA miss expectations, the stock is likely to test the confluence of the open price gap and rising 50-day moving average ~$400.

Tesla EPS: 3 Key Catalysts

Tesla’s post-earnings price action will likely be determined by the answer to three critical questions, including:

1. Has Tesla’s Legacy EV Business Bottomed? Tesla recently produced and announced a record number of vehicle deliveries. However, investors will be listening closely to see what Elon Musk and his team have to say about forward expectations in the wake of the removal of federal EV tax credits, lower interest rates, and the new ‘Model Y’ sales performance.

2. Will Energy Segment Growth Continue? In the absence of a growing EV business, Tesla Energy has been a bastion of growth. Last year, the segment grew at a robust 67%. Meanwhile, thus far in 2025, energy storage deployments have increased at a triple-digit pace. With the AI boom in full force, Tesla’s energy storage business should benefit as energy-hungry data centers require energy storage solutions like Tesla’s ‘Megapack.’

3. Will Tesla Meet Timelines for FSD, Robotaxis, and Optimus? Elon Musk is well-known for his aggressive timelines for new products. However, if Musk can convince investors that future product roadmaps are still on track, investors will reward him.

Bottom Line

As Tesla prepares to report Q3 earnings, investors face a familiar mix of excitement and uncertainty. With the stock surging nearly 93% in the past six months, expectations are high – yet tempered by Tesla’s recent mixed track record.

Project to create 200 jobs during construction and others during 30-year operation

Part of the State Government's $6.4 billion investment in renewable energy infrastructure

Construction has started on the 105-megawatt King Rocks Wind Farm, a Synergy led renewable energy project that is part of the Cook Government's clean energy transition for Western Australia.

Workers have been mobilised, and earthworks have started at the site, 35km north-east of Hyden.

King Rocks Wind Farm will feature 17 wind turbines and will generate enough power for up to 70,000 homes.

The project will also involve construction of associated infrastructure such as roads, transmission lines and substation facilities.

Towers up to 125m with turbine blades of up to 80m long take the total height of each wind turbine to about 206m.

The Cook Labor Government has committed $513 million towards the project.

The wind farm will provide an economic boost to the region by creating about 200 jobs during construction, with other jobs during operations over the next 30 years.

This is in addition to more than 30 jobs created through the construction of Synergy's Hyden Workers' Accommodation built nearby.

The facility will feature 189 temporary rooms and associated facilities. The first workers are using the facility.

The Government has invested $6.4 billion on renewable energy infrastructure since 2017.

King Rocks Wind Farm is being delivered by State-owned Synergy and is expected to be completed in 2027.

Tesla's electric vehicle sales growth One thing is clear: Tesla's 2025 hasn't panned out quite the way management expected it would.
Moreover, they align with management's statements to investors this year, not least when Musk ""let the cat out of the bag"" on the earnings call in July, saying the affordable model would be ""just a Model Y.""
Indeed, there's evidence to suggest that Tesla's sales are already building momentum after a disappointing first half.
Remember that the looming removal of the federal EV tax credit only impacted U.S. sales, so Tesla's strength in international sales was particularly welcome.","Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) latest move -- releasing lower-priced versions of its Model Y and Model 3 -- looks more like a reactionary action than a game-changing effort to make electric vehicles (EVs) more accessible to the mass market. It makes perfect sense in the context of where the business is right now, but it won't appease investors who are looking at Tesla purely as an EV company. Here's the lowdown.

Tesla's electric vehicle sales growth

One thing is clear: Tesla's 2025 hasn't panned out quite the way management expected it would. Back in October of last year, CEO Elon Musk made a rough estimate that the company would achieve 20% to 30% EV sales growth in 2025, backed by lower-cost vehicles ""starting in the first half of 2025,"" and ""the advent of autonomy.""

However, despite robust sales in the third quarter (partly due to a pull forward in sales as customers rushed to take advantage of the federal EV tax credit, which the Big Beautiful Bill ended as of Sept. 30), Tesla's vehicle deliveries were still down 6.4% year over year for the first nine months of 2025. Its new, lower-priced variants only became available in the fourth quarter, and if by ""advent of autonomy"" Musk means fully autonomous robotaxis and/or a fully autonomous full self-driving (FSD) option for the cars it sells, it hasn't achieved that yet either.

New, lower-cost vehicles

That said, the lower-cost trims (a Model Y standard selling for just under $40,000 and a Model 3 standard selling for just under $37,000) will likely help its sales efforts. Moreover, they align with management's statements to investors this year, not least when Musk ""let the cat out of the bag"" on the earnings call in July, saying the affordable model would be ""just a Model Y."" In other words, he did not promise to release the company's long-awaited, brand-new, lower-cost model in 2025.

The strategy makes sense, particularly in light of Washington's removal of the EV tax credit. The Model Y and Model 3 have been selling well in the U.S. in 2025, and the arrival of versions with meaningfully lower base prices will inevitably help sales. Moreover, the new trims are unlikely to cannibalize sales of the higher-end Model Y and Model 3 trims, as the price differentials between the new models and the next-cheapest models are $5,000 and $5,500, respectively.

Instead of the much-anticipated launch of a low-cost model, this move appears to be a response to the removal of the tax credit in the U.S. and the persistence of relatively high interest rates worldwide.

What the new models mean to investors

While these cheaper EVs aren't game-changers in themselves, they do build on some improving sales trends for the company. Indeed, there's evidence to suggest that Tesla's sales are already building momentum after a disappointing first half.

For example, interpolating from Tesla's third-quarter delivery data and industry analysis of Tesla's sales in the U.S., it's possible to argue that its strength in the third quarter was broad-based and possibly related to the Model Y refresh gaining traction. Remember that the looming removal of the federal EV tax credit only impacted U.S. sales, so Tesla's strength in international sales was particularly welcome.

Moreover, the fact that the new models are unlikely to cannibalize sales of existing Model Y and Model 3 vehicles means the road is still clear for Tesla to launch its much-talked-about $25,000 car, which some refer to as the ""Model 2."" If that vehicle comes to market, it's highly likely to be a wholly new and differentiated product that won't impact sales of other Tesla models.

What it means for investors

These models should build on the momentum the company gained in the third quarter and help it navigate a challenging period in the U.S., particularly due to the loss of the EV tax credit. They will also add to the fleet of vehicles on the road whose values could be significantly raised by the ""advent of autonomy.""

While uncertainty remains when it comes to the timeline of these events -- specifically, the company's deployment of fully autonomous robotaxis and the later public availability of fully autonomous FSD (which would be a game-changer) -- the stock will remain an option for speculative investors, albeit an excellent one.

The investment will increase the automaker’s annual US vehicle production by 50% and create more than 5000 new jobs across plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The expansion will support five new vehicle launches and 19 product refreshes through 2029.

“This investment in the U.S. – the single largest in the Company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis chief executive and North America COO Antonio Filosa says.

The company plans to reopen its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois with a $600 million investment to produce the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the US market. Production is expected to begin in 2027, creating around 3300 new jobs.

Plant investments across four states

In Ohio, Stellantis will invest nearly $400 million to move production of an all-new midsize truck to the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The production shift is expected to create more than 900 jobs, with launch timing planned for 2028.

The Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan will receive nearly $100 million to produce an all-new range-extended electric vehicle (EV) and internal combustion engine large SUV beginning in 2028. The new program is anticipated to add more than 900 jobs to the facility, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, with production anticipated to launch in 2029.

In Indiana, the company will invest more than $100 million in its Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine beginning in 2026, adding more than 100 jobs.

Filosa says accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since taking the role. “Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” he says.

The announcement represents a stark contrast to Australia’s automotive manufacturing landscape, where local vehicle production ended in 2017 with the closure of the last Holden plant. While Australia once hosted significant automotive manufacturing operations from General Motors, Ford and Toyota, the country now relies entirely on vehicle imports.

Stellantis’ US footprint includes 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centres and research and development locations across 14 states, supporting more than 48,000 employees, 2600 dealers and nearly 2300 suppliers.

EV Tax Credits By State (Tax Foundation) Tax Foundation","The federal gravy train for EV buyers has reached the end of the line. As of September 30, 2025, Uncle Sam officially stopped footing the bill for your next electric car, causing concern among automakers about plummeting demand.

However, that doesn’t necessarily mean there’s no help available. Depending on where you live, your state might still have you covered with its own tax credits scheme.

Who’s Still Paying Up?

But some states are downright stingy with their cash, meaning there’s no one-size-fits-all discount like the old $7,500 federal aid. According to new data from the Tax Foundation, the state-level landscape is a messy patchwork of perks, penalties, and paperwork.

While some states are still rolling out the red carpet for EVs, others are quietly slapping owners with new registration fees to make up for lost gas-tax revenue, highlighting how different attitudes are to green policies across the country.

A few states remain firmly on the side of the buyer, including Colorado, which from this November will provide rebates of up to $9,000 to low and middle-income families trading in an old gas car for a new electric vehicle, and as much as $6,000 on a used one.

Oregon and Maine both offer $7,500 of credits, Oklahoma gives up to $5,500, and Connecticut and Vermont will cut the price of your EV by $5,000. Illinois, Kansas and New Jersey make $4,000 available and various other states will throw in between $1,500 and $3,500 to encourage you to go electric.

Where EVs Cost You More

Then there are the less friendly states. Georgia has no EV incentives at all and charges drivers $235 per year just to register their electric vehicle. Indiana is arguably even worse: it also has no EV incentives, charges $230 to register one, and $77 to register a hybrid.

Perhaps surprisingly, given its history of leading on green matters, California no longer offers state help for EV buyers. Governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed it wasn’t economically viable to offer aid right now, though his office has since suggested a scheme might be introduced next year.

Some states don’t simply rely on EV registration fees to help offset lost gas revenue, but also add tax to the cost of charging at public charging stations. Those states include Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma, the Tax Foundation reports, while also noting the flaw in their plan: drivers who charge at home escape the duty.

The takeaway here is that the government taking federal tax credits off the table doesn’t necessarily mean you can no longer afford that EV. You just need to check out where your state stands on the issue.

“The US support was a catalyst for additional Canadian government support.” Mining companies will welcome investment wherever it comes from, given how hard it is to raise funds, Fasken’s Tóth noted.
Rare earths The US has also broadened its footprint in critical minerals and rare earth projects through new equity, contract and grant support.
Northern Dynasty Minerals (TSX: NDM; NYSE-A: NAK) is challenging in court the US Environmental Protection Agency’s veto of the project.
“It’s good for government to get behind mining projects,” Fasken’s Tóth said.","The Trump administration is ratcheting up government ownership in mining companies that are nominally Canadian, raising questions about whether Ottawa plans similar investments.

Trump has ordered his Department of War to take a 10% stake in Trilogy Metals (TSX, NYSE American: TMQ) and help fund South32 (ASX, LSE, JSE: S32), joint partners of the Arctic copper-zinc project in Alaska. That follows a 5% US government stake announced this month in Lithium Americas (TSX, NYSE: LAC), which is developing the $3 billion Thacker Pass project in Nevada. Trilogy and Lithium Americas are based in Vancouver.

“The funny part is, they’re not Canadian because all their assets are in the United States, so are they Canadian? Are they American?” says Krisztián Tóth, a partner at Toronto-based law firm Fasken who focuses on mining financing and cross-border transactions. “The national security aspect of this has not been examined fully, but that’s really what it goes to anyway.”

The American government investing in Canadian companies isn’t new – that goes back to the Second World War with funding for Quebec aluminum plants – and the Biden administration earmarked millions for projects in Canada through clean energy and transition metals funding. However, Trump officials are promoting direct ownership, which has elated some mining industry players while others urge caution.

Canada has a more nuanced approach, at least on paper so far. Prime Minister Mark Carney has opened a Major Projects Office to fast-track energy and mining projects, but he’s stopped short of seeking equity stakes in projects, although the government under his predecessor did buy a gas pipeline to help build it. Carney also makes sure to mention that environmental and Indigenous concerns will be addressed amid government support.

Northwest Territories

Fortune Minerals (TSX: FT), developing the NICO cobalt-gold-bismuth-copper project in the Northwest Territories with a refinery in Alberta, received $6.4 million last year from the Pentagon as part of a total $17 million from governments on both sides of the border. The project has the world’s largest deposit of bismuth, which is used in products such as Pepto Bismol.

“The validation and combined support from the governments have allowed the project to move forward during a challenging environment at a quicker pace than would have been possible with support from only one government,” Fortune President and CEO Robin Goad said in an emailed reply to questions. “The US support was a catalyst for additional Canadian government support.”

Mining companies will welcome investment wherever it comes from, given how hard it is to raise funds, Fasken’s Tóth noted. But he urged Ottawa to revise its policy on foreign investment, like how it has been applied to the Chinese. Canada has ordered China-controlled businesses to divest from Canadian companies even when the mineral assets were abroad.

“I echo the words of Ronald Reagan: ‘The most dangerous words you’re ever going to hear is, I’m the government, and I’m here to help,’” Tóth said in a phone interview.

“As long as there’s a free market and the government doesn’t artificially keep out other potential investors, then it’s healthy for the government to also want to invest in projects. I would prefer there would be more Canadian-based projects than foreign projects, just because we should be developing our own assets. And if the government has an interest in those assets, then they might be more compelled to have policies that favour development.”

Asian giant

Western nations are targeting the Asian giant which controls some 90% of critical metals mining and processing in a surge of resource nationalism that has lately erupted into a Cold War of critical metals. Washington and Beijing are squaring off over access to advanced US computer chips, and the critical minerals needed for aerospace, defence applications and mobile phones that America craves.

MP Materials (NYSE: MP), which holds the producing Mountain Pass rare earths mine in California, secured in July a $400 million agreement with the Pentagon that will see it acquire a 15% stake in MP and buy critical minerals for defence projects. The miner also reached a deal with the Department of Defense in August for a $150 million loan to add heavy rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

Jay Martin, CEO of mining forum company Cambridge which runs the annual Vancouver Resource Investment Conference, was a bit of two minds on government stakes, but he considers nation states as corporations, and their investment as good for the industry.

“It’s a bit distasteful, because I don’t want government in my private business,” Martin told The Northern Miner podcast host Adrian Pocobelli.

“But if we could have the firepower of the US government, adding some additional capital, cutting red tape and expediting the permitting processes of our core industries being raw materials, that’s good for commodity investors.”

Indeed, the stocks of companies with US government investment have soared on the news.

Kevin Torpy, senior vice-president of mining at Graphite One (TSXV: GPH), welcomed $37.5 million in US government funding under Biden in 2023 to advance the $1.13 billion Graphite Creek project in Alaska.

“Graphite One is grateful for the funding and believes that this type of federal support for establishing domestic supply chains for graphite and other critical minerals is an important part of the nation’s security,” Torpy said in an emailed reply to questions.

The funding helped Graphite One accelerate its feasibility study for the project, deemed to hold America’s largest reserve of the battery metal.

More examples

Recent Defense Production Act and Department of Energy grants illustrate how widely Washington is investing across North America.

In Canada, funding included $20 million in August 2024 for Electra Battery Materials’ (NASDAQ, TSX: ELBM) cobalt sulfate refinery in Temiskaming Shores, Ontario, and $8.35 million in May 2024 for Lomiko Metals (TSXV: LMR) to convert flake graphite into battery-grade anode material. The Quebec government, however, remains opposed to Lomiko’s project after local complaints.

Fireweed Metals (TSXV: FWZ) received $15.8 million to advance development studies for the Mactung tungsten project — the world’s largest deposit — in the Northwest Territories and Yukon.

In the United States, Canadian companies have also benefited from Biden-era programs, including $114.8 million for Talon Metals (TSX: TLO) to build a nickel processing plant in North Dakota, plus $20.6 million and $2.4 million for expanded exploration and extraction research at its Tamarack project in Minnesota and Michigan.

Under Trump, Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) secured $18.4 million to scale up rare-earth separation in Louisiana and $4 million from the US Army for separation demonstrations at its Kingston, Ontario. RapidSX plant.

Rare earths

The US has also broadened its footprint in critical minerals and rare earth projects through new equity, contract and grant support. Lynas Rare Earths (ASX: LYC) secured a Department of Defense contract to build a heavy rare earth separation facility in Texas, supplementing earlier Title III support for light rare earth processing there.

Perpetua Resources (NASDAQ, TSX: PPTA) won up to $6.9 million from the US Army for its Stibnite antimony-gold project in Idaho. NioCorp (NASDAQ, TSX: NB) is slated to receive Title III support via a $10 million award for its Elk Creek rare earth, niobium and titanium project in Nebraska.

Golden Metal Resources (AIM: GMET) was awarded $62 million under a Department of Defense program to support tungsten production. Syrah Resources (ASX: SYR) received a conditional commitment of up to $107 million from the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office to expand lithium-ion battery materials capacity at its Vidalia, Louisiana facility.

Opposition

The Trump administration is supporting critical minerals projects even where there is local and environmental opposition, like at Rio Tinto’s (ASX: RIO) Resolution project in Arizona and Trilogy’s project in Alaska. There, the environmental advocacy group Sierra Club called the government investment a blow to subsistence communities and wildlife because of potential impact on caribou migration.

It remains to be seen if Washington will go as far to support the contentious Pebble copper-gold project in the same state. Northern Dynasty Minerals (TSX: NDM; NYSE-A: NAK) is challenging in court the US Environmental Protection Agency’s veto of the project.

“It’s good for government to get behind mining projects,” Fasken’s Tóth said. “It’s been a long time since Western governments have been pro-mining. For too long, mining has been the anti-carbon type of view. And it’s actually nice to see that governments are realising that mining plays a central role in the world, much like water and air.”

Forty new Level 2 charging ports will be installed in Springfield, Illinois courtesy of a $629,000 grant from the Illinois Community Charging Program. The city’s electric utility, City Water Light and Power, received the grant and will own the new chargers. The utility also aims to continue expanding charging infrastructure after the 40 new ports are added.

At the moment, Springfield has about 190 charging stations, according to PlugShare. Believe it or not, 16 of them are free, according to the same website. Just under 40 are fast chargers.

On the surface, it might not seem that adding 40 new public EV charging ports is that newsworthy, but it is, because installing more new chargers decreases range anxiety in places where there aren’t enough and new installations are actually happening in many places. “Around 780 public high-speed charging stations opened across the country in the third quarter of 2025. By all accounts, that’s the largest such infrastructure boom on record, according to Department of Energy data reviewed by Bloomberg.”

Springfield has a population of about 114,000, and hundreds of thousands visit to experience the Abraham Lincoln-related sites each year. Many travel to Springfield by car. “Tourism is big business in Springfield, bringing in $536 million in 2023. Tourism is tied to 3,500 hospitality jobs in the city and $20 million in local tax revenue. That’s according to Visit Springfield Director Scott Dahl.” You wouldn’t think little old Springfield would have so many annual tourists, but it does, and more and more of them drive EVs.

Springfield is the Illinois state capital and is a population center for central Illinois, so it has visitors related to all the government activities too.

The whole state of Illinois has fewer than 150,000 registered EVs. Expanding public charging infrastructure can help with greater EV adoption, especially since federal EV purchasing incentives are no longer available.

Some people seem to believe EVs need to have 800 miles of range or more to solve “range anxiety,” but this is not true. What is needed is the expansion of EV charging infrastructure to decrease the distance between existing public chargers.

One example, which is not in Illinois, is the “West Coast Electric Highway, an extensive network of electric vehicle (EV) DC fast charging stations located every 25 to 50 miles along Interstate 5 and other major roadways in the Pacific Northwest.”

When there are plenty of public EV chargers every 25 miles or so, no EVs will need a huge amount of range.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-Oct-19-2025-08_30_23-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-10-20 08:12:51.450064

One of those homeowners is Dan Harrison, who frequently experienced hours-long power outages in his Los Angeles home before investing in a rooftop solar system, as the New York Times explained.
Harrison produces more electricity than he uses, meaning he pays nothing for energy, compared to his prior bill of $3,600 a year.
It's easy to see why more energy experts are recommending solar, both for homeowners' peace of mind and grid stability.
""It's the one-two punch you need to solve the climate crisis,"" Omar Nasser, founder of Treepublic Solar, the company that installed Harrison's system, told the Times.","With power bills surging in many areas across the United States, more homeowners are turning to solar energy and battery storage to cut costs and gain energy independence. One of those homeowners is Dan Harrison, who frequently experienced hours-long power outages in his Los Angeles home before investing in a rooftop solar system, as the New York Times explained.

Over the past six years, he's gradually added more panels and batteries to the system, and the investment has paid off. Harrison produces more electricity than he uses, meaning he pays nothing for energy, compared to his prior bill of $3,600 a year.

As a bonus, his neighbors can enjoy the excess electricity generated by the system, allowing them to avoid disruptive and even dangerous power outages that may occur during extreme temperatures. Harrison told the Times he often has enough juice left over to send around 50% back to the grid.

By going solar, you're not just saving a ton of money on energy bills, but also benefiting the planet by producing non-polluting electricity, and potentially helping your neighbor keep the lights on. EnergySage can help you find the perfect system for your needs with its free tools that let you compare quotes from qualified installers and save up to $10,000 on a home system.

You can also use its free mapping tool to view the average cost of a rooftop solar setup, along with available tax incentives based on your state, making it easy to maximize your savings. However, if your budget doesn't allow for the upfront investment in solar, leasing might be a more suitable option.

With Palmetto's LightReach program, you can have panels installed for no money down and never have to worry about maintenance. Plus, you can avoid volatile energy prices and lock in low rates, allowing you to reap all the benefits of solar without breaking the bank.

Pairing home solar with an energy-efficient heat pump can help you save even more on electric bills, and if you want to see your options, Mitsubishi can connect you with a vetted installer who will help you find the right system for your home.

Make sure to take advantage of the 30% solar tax credit and home appliance rebates by the end of the year, as they will expire on Dec. 31.

A generation of young people across Britain will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, under new plans announced by the government today as part of the clean energy superpower mission

Backed by record government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, government will today (Sunday 19 October) publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

See the Clean Energy Jobs Plan

Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said: “We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry – and will drive growth across the nation.

“Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.”

The government’s clean energy mission is already delivering for the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

The government has also given Sizewell C the green light, which will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, announced Rolls Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs, and kickstarted the Acorn and the Viking projects in Scotland and the North East that is estimated to support a combined 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships. This builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans – Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

Upskill existing workers – Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least 1 in 6 ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 60,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said: Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

“Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.!

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, said: “After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy – as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

“Crucially, it puts decent work at the heart of our energy system. And it shows that when government makes a plan with unions and workers, the whole country can benefit.

“Whether it’s welders in Wrexham or pipefitters on Teesside, the firm commitment to clean energy jobs being good union jobs is one which will improve working lives the country over.

“We now look forward to government delivering a similarly robust and funded plan for the North Sea transition, which safeguards jobs and livelihoods.”

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said: “GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs.

“GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this.

“We need fair work agreements and taxpayers’ cash has to be spend where good jobs are going to be created. Today’s plan not only sets out that expectation but crucially, how good jobs can be measured.”

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT, said: “RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain.

“This plan has the potential to create hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the UK, offering real opportunities for those wishing to transition from oil and gas and for a new generation of workers in their own communities.”

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said: “Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.

“Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles. Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.”

Alasdair McDiarmid, Assistant General Secretary of Community, said: “After long years of managed decline and neglect under previous governments, we now have an ambitious government which is serious about rebuilding Britain’s industrial base. Crucially, the government is also investing in the skills needed to power the future of British manufacturing – something Community has long called for.

“The push for new clean energy jobs will also support our members in both the light industries and steel sector, with steel being an essential component for green energy infrastructure and construction.

“We look forward to opportunities to collaborate with the government as they roll out this initiative across the UK, delivering for working people in the communities they live in.”

Sue Ferns OBE, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect, said: “The infrastructure investment required to achieve the government’s clean energy mission must be backed by a major boost to jobs and skills.

“If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development. In this context is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.”

Frances O’Grady, Former General Secretary of the TUC, said: “Energy workers and their families are at the heart of this plan – showing the clean energy transition provides not just energy security but job security.

“Alongside this, it’s a promise that every pound of taxpayers’ money will be used to help create the decent apprenticeships, jobs, and livelihoods that Britain needs.”

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Well paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition. Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights.

“The actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.

Chris O’Shea, Chief Executive of Centrica, said: “We have committed to creating a new apprenticeship for every day of this decade. These new secure, skilled, well-paid jobs are key to unlocking the economic growth the UK so desperately needs.

“Clean energy isn’t simply about new technology – it’s about renewing purpose and harnessing the skills and infrastructure that have served us for decades to power the next chapter.

“I’m proud Centrica has the largest unionised workforce in UK energy and services, and we are delighted to welcome the government’s Clean Jobs Plan as a vital step in recognising the skills, protections and careers that must underpin the energy transition.”

Keith Anderson, CEO of ScottishPower, said: “Thanks to the clear direction set out by the government’s Clean Power 2030 Mission, we’re investing at record levels in the clean electricity infrastructure the UK needs for energy security and economic growth.

“Our £24 billion investment plan is creating thousands of job opportunities. We’re recruiting for good, well-paid skilled jobs at record levels. We’re welcoming 300 new recruits in the last 3 months of 2025 alone and aim to bring on another 2,000 jobs up to 2027.

“Many of these jobs are in the communities that we serve in Scotland, England and Wales. This is on top of the benefits for local supply chain businesses across the country from our commitment to domestic procurement that currently supports 70,000 jobs in the UK supply chain.”

EDF power solutions UK CEO Matthieu Hue said: “We welcome the plan which brings clarity on the scale of the opportunity for people across the UK to work in high quality jobs which will contribute to our electric future.

“EDF power solutions has 2 GW of wind, solar and battery in operation and our goal is to have 5 times that amount by 2035, so we will need many more skilled people to help us reach our ambition.

“Our partnership with 4 trade unions, GMB, Prospect, Unison and Unite shows our commitment to working together with them to grow our business.”

Darren Davidson, Vice President of Siemens Energy UK&I, said: “Siemens Energy is a major employer in the UK with 6,500 workers at sites across the UK. We have taken on 140 new apprentices this autumn, and we currently have more than 200 active vacancies.

“The jobs plan announcement is welcome news, building on the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan that was launched at our Hull offshore wind blade factory.”

Chris Norbury, CEO of E.ON UK, said: “Clean power is a defining opportunity to grow the economy, strengthen energy security, and create skilled jobs that support communities nationwide. We welcome the Clean Energy Jobs Plan as a vital step towards building the workforce to realise that potential.

“We’re proud to already be delivering on this ambition by supporting around 800 people annually through our Net Zero Training Academy and wider skills initiatives, and welcoming over 1,300 apprentices across 100 programmes since 2018.

“Through partnerships with trade unions, schools, and local governments, we’re ensuring green jobs are good jobs, rooted in local communities with real progression, purpose, and opportunity. We look forward to working with government and industry to scale up this mission and ensure no region is left behind.”

Michael Lewis, CEO Uniper said: “We’re really pleased to see the launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan and the recommendations within it.

“Uniper aims to invest approximately €8 billion into growth and transformation projects by the early 2030s, including solar and onshore wind projects, hydrogen projects, and a new combined-cycle gas turbine power station with carbon capture technology at our Connah’s Quay site – contributing to the retention and creation of jobs, and supporting the regional economy.

“We recognise the need for workers to have the right skills now, and in the future, to support the UK’s and our own ambitions.”

Zac Richardson, Group Chief Engineer at National Grid, said: “Secure, affordable and clean energy is essential to unlocking UK economic growth and productivity – ambitions which are underpinned by electricity networks and the unprecedented levels of planned investment in them.

“We welcome the government’s focus on skills and training – especially for technical roles vital to our energy future – and look forward to working together to build a diverse, homegrown workforce that can deliver the grid of tomorrow.”

Tania Kumar, Director of Net Zero at the CBI, said: “The growth of the clean energy economy is creating opportunities for people and places across the whole of the UK. The launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan offers a tangible way to connect communities with both the opportunities emerging across the sector and the businesses at the forefront of delivering them.

“If we want people to feel invested in the transition and ensure they are able to participate in it, we must show them how they fit into the vision. This plan begins to do just that, laying out clear pathways no matter whether you’re in work, seeking employment or returning to the job market.”

Dhara Vyas, CEO of Energy UK, said: “Today’s announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system. It rightly recognises the need to tackle the skills challenge collectively by investing in both new talent and our existing workforce.

“With up to 400,000 new jobs on the horizon and a clear focus on high-quality, inclusive opportunities, the Clean Energy Job Plan spotlights a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a cleaner, fairer energy system whose benefits will be felt by people and communities across the country.”

Jane Cooper, Deputy Chief Executive at Renewable UK, said: “The Clean Energy Jobs Plan sets out the scale of the massive opportunity which the UK has to create tens of thousands of new jobs in renewables all over the country.

“It includes practical measures which will enable government and industry to work even closer together to maximise this, such as opening new Technical Excellence Colleges, building on Britain’s current success as a global leader in clean power.

“This long-awaited plan delivers on employers’ calls for a coherent government workforce strategy for clean energy and we look forward to working with Ministers to realise its ambitions.”

Katy Heidenreich Supply Chain and People Director at Offshore Energies UK, said: “Investing in skills development is essential to support the UK’s energy sector and it is encouraging to see governments recognise the huge resource of our oil and gas workforce and how their skills can be developed to provide the expertise needed for the energy mix of the future.

“Oil and gas workers have a continuing role in powering the UK today and for years to come. A successful energy future—one that is increasingly homegrown—depends on supporting the industries and people delivering energy now, alongside growing capability across all technologies.”

Claire Mack OBE, Chief Executive of Scottish Renewables, said: “The clean power mission is not just about energy security for the country, it’s about good jobs and a workforce fit the future in your locale. The scale and importance of the energy transition requires new approaches to ensure investments in skills, apprenticeships and training serve the needs of the entire economy.

“Scotland is home to world-class energy skills expertise. Working with both governments, the clean energy industry can build on this through the breadth of projects coming forward today and in the years ahead. The Clean Energy Jobs Plan is an important signal to the public and private sectors of how we must quickly strengthen our partnership on jobs and skills.”

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The net zero economy is continuing to grow, and the Clean Energy Jobs Plan clearly sets out how the government will recruit essential workers who are critical for the UK’s energy transition. This will support both net zero and economic growth across the UK, providing certainty for people and local communities.

“The plan also recognises the critical role that oil and gas workers in the North Sea will play in driving the renewable energy sector. Aligning skills standards between these 2 sectors and identifying current and future skills needs to support our low carbon future, are essential to delivering a successful UK energy transition.”

Verity Davidge, Director of Policy and Public Affairs, at Make UK said: “Manufacturers are moving at pace to invest in decarbonisation and net zero projects and the transition to clean energy offers huge opportunities for industry. To take full advantage, companies will need to have access to increasingly higher levels of skills and a talent pipeline which will fuel the growth we need to see.

“As such, this plan is a welcome recognition by government and a positive step forward that work needs to start now to get ahead of our competitors and ensure industry is equipped with the skills to do the job. In tandem with this plan we need to accelerate skills reform including ensuring that apprenticeship courses are funded to cover the real cost of training, as outlined in the clean energy sector plan.”

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said: “We welcome the Clean Energy Jobs Plan’s recognition that hydrogen will be vital to net zero and to creating high-quality jobs. Much of the oil and gas workforce already has transferable skills, and supporting their transition into hydrogen will be key to a just and rapid shift to a clean energy economy.

“The Hydrogen and Carbon Capture Skills Accelerator is a crucial first step, and over time we must move from designing courses to delivering hands-on training and upskilling to build the workforce of the future.”

Olivia Powis, CEO of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said: “We welcome the Clean Jobs Plan and its recognition of the vital role CCUS and hydrogen will play in achieving the UK’s growth and decarbonisation goals while keeping industries competitive. Developing the necessary skills base is crucial to unlocking these sectors’ full potential and protecting thousands of existing industrial jobs.

“Establishing a dedicated Hydrogen and CCUS Skills Accelerator, in partnership with industry, marks an important step toward creating high-quality employment and ensuring a just transition for skilled workers from the North Sea. The CCSA looks forward to collaborating with government and partners to build the workforce powering the clean energy future.”

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “This Jobs Plan shows the huge opportunity clean power offers the UK, and the vital role nuclear will play in delivering it.

“With 100,000 people already working in nuclear in good, skilled jobs across the country, new stations like Sizewell C and a fleet of SMRs will create thousands more — especially for young people — in clean and secure energy.”

Chris Hewett, Chief Executive, Solar Energy UK, said: “Solar energy and battery energy storage already support over 20,000 British jobs, with expectations that the sectors will employ more than twice the number in 10 years’ time.

“But to reach our goals for cheaper, cleaner power, we need to redouble our efforts to attract and train staff for these fast-growing sectors. With our Solar Careers UK programme and critical support from government under the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, we have every expectation that our aspirations will be fulfilled.”

Yselkla Farmer, CEO of BEAMA, said: “We have a long heritage of manufacturing for the electricity industry in the UK. As a supply chain at the heart of the clean energy sector we know the growth potential is substantial as we electrify our energy system.

“The biggest limiting factor for investment today is the availability of a skilled workforce and therefore we welcome the focus on job creation for our supply chain. For network equipment manufacturing alone our average member expects to double employment by 2035.

“This plan sets the foundations we need to help this statistic rise further. Our members offer good jobs, in an industry rooted in local communities right across the UK, what they need is long term certainty and a commitment to support investment which this plan targets.”

Lawrence Slade, CEO of Energy Networks Association, said: “This plan is an important step towards accelerating the real economic benefits of the clean energy transition right around the country.

“Today network operators employ around 26,000 people and facilitate 1,500 apprenticeships, in order to maintain the safe, reliable operation of over 500,000 miles of wires and cables.

“Tomorrow, the clean energy transition will underpin new employment opportunities and economic expansion, with tens of thousands of jobs across the country needed to upgrade the grid, not just temporary positions, but long-term careers, from apprenticeships to advanced engineering roles.

“By working together on the Electricity Networks Sector Growth Plan, we will build on existing work and give industry and government the clarity and confidence needed to invest in the workforce, skills and supply chain capacity that will help drive us towards a clean power system.”

Lieutenant General (Retd) Richard Nugee CB CVO CBE, Chair, Mission Renewable, said: “The Clean Energy Jobs Plan reflects the valuable contributions those who have served have made and can continue to make to the nation.

“By linking veterans and their families with career opportunities in the clean energy sector, Mission Renewable helps companies tap into and retain skilled talent, while at the same time enabling Armed Forces communities to thrive and feel valued. The sector and companies benefit, the veterans benefit and ultimately the nation benefits from skilled people delivering growth and opportunity.”

Paul Cox, Group CEO of Energy & Utility Skills, said: “For the government to achieve its 2030 target, we must put people at the heart of that ambition – only by having the right people with the right skills will we deliver the UK’s energy future.

“Energy and Utility Skills Group has worked closely with the Office for Clean Energy Jobs on its plans, scoping the workforce demands as well as convening the industry to create a UK-wide awareness and attraction campaign.

“We will continue to work with purpose and pace to support the Clean Energy Jobs Plan alongside our partners in the sector.

“Together, we can turn ambition into impact.”

David Hughes, Chief Executive of Association of Colleges, said: “This exciting plan will help people get the skills they need to secure good work locally and it is great to see the investment in colleges to back the government’s ambitions on a net zero future.

“With employers stepping up as well, colleges will be able to offer the training young people need to enter the net zero construction sector, as well as the re-training adults need to move jobs.

“Colleges are ready to be at the heart of this transition, to create real career pathways and help the country lead the global green economy.”",https://nen.press/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/clean-energy-jobs-boom-big.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:08:03.908016
,Indiana and Evs,2025-10-19 19:00:38+00:00,the Guardian,The Guardian view on hybrid cars: profitable for carmakers but not very green | Editorial,"Editorial, www.theguardian.com",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-hybrid-cars-profitable-for-carmakers-but-not-very-green,"While electric vehicles (EVs) looked like science fiction, that prediction looked prescient.
Last week it emerged that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) aren’t very green.
Hybrid vehicles are, however, very profitable.
Carmakers can charge top dollar for what are essentially re-engineered petrol cars with a battery bolted on.
It’s that Europe’s carmakers are keeping profits rolling in by squeezing cash from hybrids and petrol cars.","“Why the future is hybrid,” chirruped the Economist in 2004. While electric vehicles (EVs) looked like science fiction, that prediction looked prescient. Fast‑forward 20 years and battery technology has improved dramatically; EVs are affordable. Last week it emerged that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) aren’t very green. The sales pitch had been that motorists could use “clean” battery power for city jaunts and dirty petrol for longer trips. This promised sustainable travel without the anxiety of a limited range. But real‑world tests, by the European non-profit Transport and Environment, show that PHEVs emit just 19% less carbon dioxide than petrol and diesel cars – far short of the 75% claimed in the lab.

Hybrid vehicles are, however, very profitable. Carmakers can charge top dollar for what are essentially re-engineered petrol cars with a battery bolted on. They also remain attractive to policymakers keen for industry sops. By weakening electric vehicle targets, the UK government risks a scandal in pushing hybrids that emit five times more CO2 than claimed.

Europe is a battleground between climate necessity, commercial reality and political clout. Four big European automotive companies avoided more than €5bn in fines because emissions compliance was not judged on real-world data. Switching to electric cars seems an obvious step. Yet former Renault boss Luca de Meo said earlier this year that EVs won’t be the dominant technology in Europe for two decades. It’s not just a lack of buyers or engineering nous holding back EVs. It’s that Europe’s carmakers are keeping profits rolling in by squeezing cash from hybrids and petrol cars.

Newer competitors are stealing a march. The UK has just become the largest international market for China’s BYD, the world’s bestselling electric carmaker. And that’s without benefiting from the government’s new EV subsidy scheme, which excludes Chinese-made vehicles for environmental reasons. In Europe, where Elon Musk’s far-right political views have undermined Tesla brand loyalty, its new cheaper model will have to compete with Chinese EVs that sell for less than £20,000.

Yet even BYD may face its own reckoning. Its competitive edge rests on low-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries. If Toyota delivers on its promise to manufacture solid‑state batteries for commercial use by 2027, it could leave rivals behind by delivering safer power packs, faster charging and longer range. The tech promises to make the dream of driving an electric car on a single charge from London to Milan a reality. Disrupters getting disrupted is just capitalism. Whether it serves society depends on the wiring of the system. Markets reward what’s profitable, not what’s sustainable or equitable. So if Toyota does leapfrog BYD, the question isn’t “Is that fair?” It’s “Who benefits, and at what cost?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e2e6102981fc8669fe05af7c1fc28b2845cd887/116_0_3750_3000/master/3750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3a5189f86a58525313289d983de733d",N,,2025-10-20 08:13:00.040048

Between high gas prices and greenhouse gas emissions, it’s no wonder so many Americans have turned to electric vehicles. One recent Gallup poll even found that half of consumers have already either bought (7%) or would consider buying (44%) an electric vehicle.

One of the most popular options is a Tesla, a pioneer in the EV field. But is purchasing a Tesla worth the cost, especially when compared to a gas-powered sedan like the Nissan Sentra?

The answer depends on several factors, including your driving habits, where you live and the exact vehicle you purchase. Here’s a breakdown of what it costs to drive a Tesla monthly compared to a Nissan Sentra.

Typical Tesla Charging Costs

The cost of charging a Tesla depends on the model you choose. Using data from the Energy Information Administration, EnergySage estimated the cost of a full charge to be anywhere from $10.95 to $17.99.

The Tesla Model 3 costs the least to charge, while Models X and S cost the most (at $17.99 and $17.83, respectively). The average charging cost per mile is 4.56 cents.

Take the Tesla Model X as an example.

According to Tesla, this vehicle gets an EPA-estimated range of 352 miles at full charge. The average person drives an average of 1,123 monthly (or 13,476 miles a year). Assuming you drive the average amount, you’d need to charge the Model X three times a month. This means you’d spend around $54 monthly in charging costs ($17.99 times three).

Now, take the Tesla Model 3, which has the lowest charging costs and an estimated 357 miles per charge. You’d have to charge it just as frequently, but you’d be looking at closer to $33 in monthly charging costs.

As an aside, NRG Clean Power estimates the typical EV loses up to 10% of energy per charge. It’s also recommended to keep your vehicle plugged in during long periods of nonuse, like overnight.

Superchargers also cost anywhere from 24 cents to 48 cents per kWh, depending on location and time of day, per EnergySage. You could save by installing an at-home charger, but these devices cost between $300 and $650, not including installation.

Typical Nissan Sentra Fuel Costs

According to the official website, the 2025 Nissan Sentra has the following fuel economy:

30 MPG in the city (all models)

38 MPG on the highway (SR FWD and SR Midnight Edition FWD)

40 MPG on the highway (S FWD and SV FWD)

Depending on which model you choose, you can get up to 34 or 35 MPG in combined fuel economy rating.

Now, assume you drive the typical 1,123 miles a month. Using the national average gas price of $3.188 (as of Sept. 12, 2025), here’s what filling up at the tank would cost each month:

1,123 ÷ 34 MPG = 33.02 gallons

33.02 gallons x $3.188 = $105.27 monthly fuel costs

Fuel prices are significantly higher in some states, such as along the West Coast and Alaska, so expect to spend more if you live in one of those states. Fuel costs tend to be lower in the southeastern region.

Other Cost Considerations

Assuming typical driving habits, a Tesla could cost you anywhere from $33 to $54 a month to keep charged. In comparison, a Nissan Sentra costs closer to $105. That’s $51 to $72 more per month.

But there are other costs to consider, such as maintenance, insurance and the sticker price. For example, the 2025 Nissan Sentra S FWD starts at $21,590. The Tesla 3, a similar-sized sedan, starts at around $44,130.

That said, you might save on maintenance with a Tesla since there are fewer oil changes and other moving parts to deal with.

He is right that there is no choice to be made between nature and housing and that both are essential. He is right that the repeated demonisation of wildlife by some in government is both inaccurate and against the deepest instincts of the British public. He is right that the planning and infrastructure bill has been spun into this narrative and that parts of it represent a huge risk for nature. But he is wrong that environment NGOs have been “mute” in response.

Collectively and individually, we have repeatedly called out the bill publicly in the media and elsewhere, including the damaging part 3 proposals and the shambolic last-minute government amendments. We have compiled hundreds of briefings, evidence and research papers highlighting the dangers within the bill and opportunities to improve it, and urged action. We have worked with our indefatigable supporters, who have sent over 100,000 emails, letters and postcards to their MPs and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

This work led to a large package of amendments that, while by no means perfect, improved part 3 of the bill, with the Office for Environmental Protection describing them as going “a long way towards addressing the issues we raised in our advice”.

We have never stopped campaigning on the bill’s flaws and we will continue to challenge where this bill could harm nature in its final stages and in implementation.

With rumours of a second planning bill also on the horizon, we will continue to do everything in our power to galvanise our supporters and to stop the environmentally, economically and politically disastrous assault on the wild spaces we all cherish.

To date, passenger cars have led Africa’s EV market, with a 61.81 percent share in 2024.
While Ghana was the leader for EV uptake in 2024, with a 29.31 percent share of the continent’s EV revenue, Ethiopia is now the fastest-growing country for EV uptake, with an anticipated CAGR of 58.92 percent through 2030.
The government has introduced a range of financial incentives to encourage EV uptake.
While infrastructure remains a major constraint to EV uptake, it demonstrates how favourable policies, financial incentives and investment in infrastructure could spur rapid change in auto-markets worldwide.","As the first country in the world to ban the import of petrol and diesel vehicles, Ethiopia is creating the blueprint for electric vehicle (EV) uptake, supported by favourable government policies. It is one of several African countries to be introducing incentives to encourage EV uptake as a means of reducing fuel dependency and supporting green transport growth.

In January 2024, Ethiopia became the first country in the world to ban the import of petrol and diesel vehicles, in a bid to reduce its fuel dependence and pollution. The government aims to import 500,000 EVs by 2030 as it encourages greater uptake across the country. While many Ethiopians were initially reluctant to switch to EV, they are becoming a much more common sight in the capital of Addis Ababa, and public perception is slowly shifting.

In Africa, the EV market size is approximately $450 million in 2025, and it is forecast to reach $4.2 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 56.3 percent between 2025 and 2030. China is expected to become a major exporter of EVs to Africa as it continues to grow its presence in the global EV market. Although the African EV market remains small, government incentives and the growing need for more sustainable transport options are gradually leading to increased uptake across the region.

Chinese, European, and African companies are investing in regional battery and vehicle assembly capacity to drive down costs and encourage uptake across the region. Meanwhile, several national policies, such as Ethiopia’s internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle ban, Ghana’s eight-year zero-tariff window, and South Africa’s production rebates, are encouraging more consumers to invest in EVs in certain parts of the continent.

To date, passenger cars have led Africa’s EV market, with a 61.81 percent share in 2024. However, there is a growing interest in two- and three-wheelers, with the market expected to grow at a CAGR of 59.72 percent between 2025 and 2030. While Ghana was the leader for EV uptake in 2024, with a 29.31 percent share of the continent’s EV revenue, Ethiopia is now the fastest-growing country for EV uptake, with an anticipated CAGR of 58.92 percent through 2030.

Before the introduction of the ICE vehicle import ban, EVs were extremely uncommon in Ethiopia. As uptake increases, it is becoming more common to see China’s BYD brand, the current market leader, dotted around Addis Ababa. There are also a range of well-known European EV brands making their way to the Ethiopian market. There are now around 115,000 EVs in Ethiopia, out of a total of 1.5 million cars across the country.

When the ICE import ban was initially proposed, many were sceptical as around half of all Ethiopians still do not have access to electricity, and just 20 percent of households have access for at least 23 hours a day. Only a third of households have access through the national electric grid and the country is plagued with regular power cuts.

The situation is expected to improve following the opening of the Ethiopian Grand Renaissance Dam in September, 14 years after it began being developed and following several delays. The dam has a maximum capacity of 5,150 MW, doubling the country’s current electricity output, of which around 97 percent comes from hydropower. However, enhancing access is a complex issue as Ethiopia requires billions of dollars in investment to improve its electric grid to the standard needed to provide both urban and rural areas with a stable supply of electricity.

Nevertheless, the government decided that banning ICE vehicles in favour of EVs would help reduce pollution as well as significantly reduce the country’s fuel dependency, with Ethiopia spending around $4.5 billion a year on fuel imports. For a country that relies heavily on cheap, green hydropower for fuel, its dependency on fuel imports to power transport is economically unsustainable.

The government has introduced a range of financial incentives to encourage EV uptake. Including sweeping tax exemptions. While the upfront cost remains extremely high for most Ethiopians, the cost of second-hand ICE vehicles has also soared since the import ban. The government also hopes to encourage the development of domestic EV production and assembly, although this is in the nascent stage.

To support the switch, the government must now invest in the rollout of charging stations and other critical infrastructure. Ethiopia currently has around 100 charging stations, most of them in Addis Ababa, with the government hoping to increase this figure to 2,300. This limits uptake outside of the capital, where electricity access is more limited.

The introduction of an ICE vehicle import ban has drawn attention to Ethiopia, as the first country in the world to introduce a measure that many governments are targeting for the 2030s. While infrastructure remains a major constraint to EV uptake, it demonstrates how favourable policies, financial incentives and investment in infrastructure could spur rapid change in auto-markets worldwide.

In reality, environmental crime is just like this, but even worse because it happens at scale.
It’s helpful to define what environmental crime is.
These mafia-style operations are perhaps easier to conceive of as serious wrongdoing than the image of environmental crime we might have had in our heads.
I’ve tried to illustrate how a strange double standard seems to apply to how we write and talk about environmental crime – and therefore how we think about it more generally.","Whenever you read, watch, or listen to the news, you’re likely to be exposed to stories of violence and murder. As a criminal psychologist, I’m often asked to comment on these cases to pick apart the motives of the perpetrators. People want these kinds of insights because murders feel frightening and horrifying, but also oddly compelling. There’s a level of focus and fascination, and the way these crimes are covered profoundly influences our perception of what the most urgent problems facing society are.

One day it struck me that the world would be a very different place if environmental crimes were treated in the same way as murders. So, why aren’t they? And should they be?

At the moment such crimes can, mistakenly, feel distant and abstract. If someone came into your flat and set fire to your furniture, stole your valuables, killed your pet, added poison to your water … what would you do? You’d be terrified. You’d go to the police. You might want revenge. You’d certainly want justice. It would be entirely obvious to you that a crime had been committed.

In reality, environmental crime is just like this, but even worse because it happens at scale. The problem is that it doesn’t always feel that way. But criminals releasing noxious gases into the air, cutting down protected forests, fishing illegally or polluting rivers do injure us in concrete ways. And that’s before you consider the broader impacts on biodiversity and climate change.

Part of the difficulty in appreciating this is that we tend to conflate all kinds of environmental harm in a way we just don’t when it comes to more familiar crimes. People intuitively understand the difference between hate speech and murder, even though both are acts of aggression. No one thinks of them as interchangeable. But that is how we tend to think of environmental crime: people who don’t separate their recycling or fly a lot are conceptually tossed into the same category as those who perpetrate heinous acts of degradation. We need to stop putting mundane ignorance or selfishness in the same bucket as serious green crimes, and focus on the ecological equivalent of serial killers.

It’s helpful to define what environmental crime is. Put simply, it happens when someone breaks the law – negligently, recklessly or deliberately – and causes environmental damage by doing so. Sometimes, specific green laws are broken by releasing high levels of toxic material into the air, water or soil, destroying protected plants or killing endangered animals. There are also more tangential crimes, such as committing fraud to get around fishing permits, laundering money to hide the proceeds of illegal mining, or engaging in corruption to facilitate wildlife trafficking.

It’s easy to default to the well-worn stereotype of evil corporations watching the world burn while raking in the proceeds of exploitation and extraction. And while corporate misconduct is part of the problem, it’s often organised crime syndicates doing the dirty work. These more closely resemble the dangerous world of drug traffickers than men in suits making decisions based on greed.

For example, in the context of wildlife trafficking, crime bosses with money and connections in China might hire middle-men in Mozambique who head into towns to recruit desperate local people willing to poach elephants or pangolins. Guards and customs agents are bribed to turn a blind eye to ivory and pangolin scales being smuggled across borders. Paperwork is forged and financial experts set up shell companies and launder money, pretending that the syndicate trades in “plastic pellets”. The same kind of structure applies if we’re talking about illegally mined minerals, toxic waste or timber harvested from protected areas.

These mafia-style operations are perhaps easier to conceive of as serious wrongdoing than the image of environmental crime we might have had in our heads. And while money is often the driving force, it isn’t the only motivator, just as “power” isn’t the only reason people commit murder. If we ask the perpetrators why they did it, their answers can be as revealing as the explanations given for other kinds of crimes. In general, there are six psychological drivers: ease, impunity, greed, rationalisation, conformity and desperation.

And if you’re tempted to turn around and say that environmental crimes don’t happen because of individuals, but because of “the system”, I hear you. Social structures, ideologies and politics have a profound impact on human behaviour. Using this term – the system – can feel like a profound contribution to a difficult discussion, underpinned by the desire not to over simplify. But exactly who, or what, is the system?

A serial killer also lives in a society, and we can blame society for any hardships they may have faced. But if on a true-crime show I were to simply cite “the system” as a motive for murder, people would want me to be more precise. We understand that choices are involved, and motives are personal, not just systemic. Otherwise, wouldn’t we all be criminals? The same goes for those whose unlawful activity damages the environment – they are neither just victims of the system, nor purely motivated by greed.

I’ve tried to illustrate how a strange double standard seems to apply to how we write and talk about environmental crime – and therefore how we think about it more generally. Imagine a world where it occupied as much space in our news feeds and podcasts as gangs and murders do. We’d hear about the damage done, and also about the efforts to catch and punish the perpetrators. This would have a number of benefits: it would act as a deterrent for potential criminals; it would counteract the kind of eco-anxiety we feel when we think “no one is doing anything”; and it would also help set new social norms, making it clear that crimes which damage the ecosystems that sustain us are as serious as personal crimes. Putting them in the same psychological category as murder would mean we could better appreciate what’s really at stake.

This therapy targets multiple binge behaviors, including excessive alcohol consumption binge eating, smoking, compulsive shopping, and problematic sexual conduct. The combination leverages MEAI’s neuroplastic properties to reduce impulsivity and reward-seeking behavior, which, together with PEA, has shown a synergistic pharmacological effect and therefore potentially offering a breakthrough in treating substance use disorders and addictions by presenting a more effective and safer treatment than those available today.

This publication builds on Clearmind’s intellectual property portfolio. The Company has filed 13 patents related to its collaboration with SciSparc, focusing on MEAI and N-Acylethanolamines combinations for conditions such as alcohol use disorder, cocaine addiction, obesity and weight loss, and depression. Preclinical data supports MEAI's efficacy in mitigating addictive behaviors while preserving normal natural reward pathways.

“The publication of this U.S. patent application represents yet another advancement in our mission to pioneer safe and effective, next-generation treatments for binge behaviors,” said Dr. Adi Zuloff-Shani, CEO of Clearmind. “By combining MEAI’s unique neuroplastic profile with PEA’s synergistic benefits, we’re aiming to address a significant unmet needs in addiction medicine. We believe that this strengthens our position as a leader in psychedelic therapeutics and paves the way for additional clinical development.”

‒ Q3 2025 Unaudited Pro Forma Net Revenue of more than $125 million ‒

‒ Q3 2025 Unaudited DefenCath Net Revenue of more than $85 million ‒

‒ Raising FY 2025 Pro Forma Net Revenue Guidance to at least $375 million ‒

‒ ~$30mm of operating synergy on a go-forward run-rate basis before year end 2025 ‒

BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CorMedix Inc. (Nasdaq: CRMD), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for life-threatening diseases and conditions, today announced selected preliminary unaudited third quarter results and provided an update on its business. These include the following key updates:

Preliminary Q3 2025 unaudited net revenue of more than $100 million, including at least $85 million for DefenCath, and preliminary pro forma Q3 2025 unaudited Company net revenue of more than $125 million ( 1 ) . DefenCath revenue growth has been driven by stronger than projected utilization by the Company’s LDO customer as well as continued utilization growth with other customers.

Based on the current sales trend for DefenCath as well as the performance of the recently acquired Melinta portfolio, CorMedix is increasing its full-year 2025 pro forma net revenue guidance from the previously announced range of $325-$350 million to at least $375 million (1) .

Company expects Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA ( 2 ) of at least $70 million.

The Company has made significant progress on the integration of Melinta and management now forecasts cost synergy capture of at least $30 million on a go-forward run-rate basis before the end of the fourth quarter 2025, with the remaining targeted synergies of $5 – $15 million expected to be captured in CY 2026.

CorMedix recently announced the completion of enrollment in the ongoing Phase III ReSPECT study of Rezzayo in prophylaxis of fungal infection in adult patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant. The Company expects to be able to share clinical data in 2Q 2026 and believes that the total addressable market for prophylaxis is more than $2 billion.

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2025 accounted for approximately $56 million, and the Company is guiding to a projected year end cash and cash equivalent balance of approximately $100 million. The Company’s Q3 cash balance was impacted by cash payments made for the acquisition of Melinta and associated closing costs, the Company’s strategic investment in Talphera, as well as increased working capital requirements necessary to support revenue growth.

The preliminary financial information presented in this press release is based on CorMedix’s current expectations and may be adjusted as a result of, among other things, the completion of the quarterly review procedures of CorMedix’s third quarter 2025 financial statements.

Q3 2025 unaudited pro forma net revenue was prepared by combining the estimated financial results for CorMedix and Melinta for the full fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, as if the transaction had closed as of the first day of the fiscal quarter. Pro Forma 2025 Net Revenue guidance was prepared by combining the estimated financial results and guidance for CorMedix and Melinta for the full fiscal year ended December 31, 2025, without further adjustment, as if the transaction had closed on January 1, 2025.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and excludes non-cash items such as stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring items. The Company expects to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP measure in its earnings release relating to the third quarter 2025 financial results. Such reconciliation is not included in this release because the Company is currently finalizing certain amounts that would be required to be included in the U.S. GAAP measure or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation.

About the Phase 2b IMPACT Study

The IMPACT ( NCT05989711 ) trial enrolled 212 participants with biopsy-confirmed MASH and fibrosis stages F2/F3 with and without diabetes randomized 1:2:2 to receive weekly subcutaneous pemvidutide doses at either 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks. Key efficacy endpoints were MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis, or fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included weight loss and non-invasive tests of fibrosis. Participants will receive a total of 48 weeks of treatment, and a final readout is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025.

About Pemvidutide

Pemvidutide is a novel, investigational, peptide-based 1:1 GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist in development for the treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD). The combined activation of GLP-1 and glucagon receptors results in appetite suppression, weight loss, and direct effects on the liver, including reductions in liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis. The FDA granted Fast Track designations to pemvidutide for the treatment of MASH and AUD, both areas of significant unmet medical need. The 48-week readout from the ongoing IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial is expected in Q4 2025. Phase 2 trials in AUD (RECLAIM) and ALD (RESTORE) were initiated in May 2025 and July 2025, respectively and are currently ongoing.

About Altimmune

Altimmune is a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel peptide-based therapeutics for liver and cardiometabolic diseases. The Company’s lead product candidate is pemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist for the treatment of MASH, Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), Alcohol-associated Liver Disease (ALD) and obesity.

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PMGC Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: ELAB) (“PMGC” or the “Company” or “we”), a diversified public holding company executing a targeted roll-up strategy in U.S.-based manufacturing, today announced that its operating subsidiary AGA Precision Systems LLC (“AGA”) has reported a sales backlog of approximately over $711,000 in current orders logged into its Material Requirements Planning system, Sage100. AGA has also confirmed that it is actively bidding on additional Request for Quotations totaling over $700,000 from new customers. PMGC believes AGA’s current backlog and pending orders reflect robust demand, underscoring AGA’s growth momentum and the strong relationships it continues to build with both existing and new customers. PMGC also believes the backlog and pending orders strengthen AGA’s position to expand its precision machining capabilities within the aerospace and defense sectors. The backlog and quotation figures referenced herein are internally prepared, unaudited, management estimates and remain subject to change.

AGA’s milestones during the current fiscal quarter included:

Capability Expansion : AGA has expanded its manufacturing capabilities with the purchase of the following high performance machinery (delivery expected in Q4 2025):

YCM RX65 5 Axis

CMZ TA30Y High Performance Turning Center

These machine’s state-of-the-art Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems are designed for true 5-axis simultaneous machining, reducing setups, improving accuracy, increasing throughput, and enabling the production of complex geometries in a single operation.

The RX65, part of YCM’s RF/RX series, is built on a rigid RAM-type structure for maximum stability, thermal control, and repeatability. This CNC platform allows operators to turn, mill, and drill complete parts in one setup producing more complex components faster and with higher precision. Engineered for power, rigidity, and accuracy, it is ideally suited for both heavy turning and fine milling, resulting in reduced setups, shortened lead times, and improved part quality.

PMGC believes this machinery can expand AGA’s machining capabilities across aerospace-grade materials, including inconel, titanium, steel, and aluminum. We expect these advanced technologies, following delivery, to enhance AGA’s ability to meet the demanding technical requirements of its aerospace and defense customers, and improve production precision and accelerating delivery times.

Team Growth & Community Impact : AGA now employs more than 15 full-time personnel across machining, quality assurance, and operations. The company anticipates doubling its production capacity over the next year, creating additional skilled manufacturing jobs within the California, Santa Ana community and contributing to local economic growth.

Rebranding : AGA has completed a corporate rebranding, including a new logo and improved website at www.AGAPrecision.com .

Forward-looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.

CORNELIUS, N.C., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alpha Modus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMOD) (“Alpha Modus” or the “Company”) today issued a statement from CEO William “Bill” Alessi addressing the recent surge in short interest in the Company’s shares.

CEO Statement

“Short interest doesn’t worry me; it excites me,” said Alessi. “If professional traders want to short Alpha Modus, they’re welcome to. That interest simply tells me the market is paying attention. When our imminent commercial announcements and contract rollouts hit the wires, those positions could have to cover—fast. We’ve built real technology, real partnerships, and a patent portfolio that defines how artificial intelligence is used throughout retail. We believe those betting against us are overlooking the scale of what we own and what we have planned to unfold.”

Why This Matters

The recent increase in short positions appears tied not to company fundamentals, but to the simple reality that Alpha Modus is a new public company—one just beginning to scale its commercial operations. Revenue takes time to build, yet that build is already underway. The Company has executed signings, initiated revenue generation, and expects those revenues to expand through its licensing-based business model. Alpha Modus’s licensing structure is designed for perpetual, recurring income—month to month, year to year—as new partners join its ecosystem and the Company continues both organic deployments and litigation-driven licensing outcomes.

Adding to this dynamic, Alpha Modus has a small public float , which naturally amplifies both volatility and the potential for short-covering pressure as material announcements are made.

Alpha Modus’s intellectual property extends across the full spectrum of AI in retail. The Company’s patents arguably embody the core methods by which AI is practiced throughout the retail industry —technologies employed by hundreds, if not thousands, of participants across the sector. The company’s litigation strategy is not based on a single lawsuit against one defendant infringing upon one or two patents; it is a coordinated enforcement and commercialization program spanning numerous patents across an entire industry. As Alpha Modus continues to expand its partner network, execute new licensing agreements, and announce additional revenue-bearing activities, those betting against the Company may quickly realize the scale and durability of the Company’s position.

About Alpha Modus

Alpha Modus Holdings Inc. develops, licenses, and enforces AI-driven retail technologies that improve in-store digital experiences, planogram intelligence, targeted promotions, and retail analytics. The Company’s patent portfolio covers the foundational methods that underpin AI in retail applications. By executing a scalable program of enforcement and commercial deployment, Alpha Modus is positioned to capture and monetize a significant share of the rapidly growing AI-in-retail market.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Alpha Modus’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates, and projections, and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying these statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, Alpha Modus’s expectations with respect to future performance.

Alpha Modus cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Alpha Modus does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

Forward-Looking Statements

Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbour protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.

PRESS RELEASE: CMB.TECH trading update

Cylembio plus pembrolizumab achieved a clinically relevant 19.4 months median progression free survival (mPFS) compared to 11.0 months mPFS with pembrolizumab alone; study narrowly missed progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint for statistical significance

Improvement in PFS favored the combination across virtually all subgroups, notably in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, BRAF V600 -mutated tumors, and elevated LDH, without adding any systemic toxicity compared to pembrolizumab alone

Final data from the Phase 2 basket trial in lung and head & neck cancers also presented

NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IO Biotech (Nasdaq: IOBT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, immune-modulatory, off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccines, today presented detailed results from its global Phase 3 trial (IOB-013/KN-D18) of Cylembio ® (imsapepimut and etimupepimut, adjuvanted), in combination with Merck’s (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma. The data, presented as a proffered paper at the Melanoma and other skin tumors session of the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Berlin, expand upon topline results reported in August 2025.

Final results from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38) evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) were also presented.

“The Phase 3 results in advanced melanoma, together with final data from our Phase 2 basket trial, continue to build on the encouraging clinical evidence seen with Cylembio in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy,” said Mai-Britt Zocca, PhD, president and chief executive officer of IO Biotech. “These data reinforce Cylembio’s potential to serve as a first-line treatment option across multiple tumor types, and we remain committed to advancing novel immune-modulatory vaccines that may help people living with cancer.”

In the randomized Phase 3 trial, 407 patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma received either Cylembio plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone. Median progression-free survival was 19.4 months for the combination and 11.0 months for pembrolizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58–1.00; p=0.0558), narrowly missing the primary endpoint prespecified threshold for statistical significance (p≤0.045).

Across virtually all subgroups, outcomes in progression-free survival consistently favored the combination regimen, including among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors (16.6 vs 3.0 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.85), BRAF V600 mutated tumors (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90), and elevated LDH (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92). In addition, a post-hoc analysis, excluding patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, showed mPFS of 24.8 months vs 11.0 months (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98).

The combination was well tolerated, with no increase in immune-mediated adverse events (34.0% vs 38.4%) or grade ≥3 treatment-related events (14.5% vs 15.6%) compared to pembrolizumab alone. Local vaccine-related injection-site reactions, reported in 56% of patients in the exploratory arm, were generally mild and transient, mostly grade 1/2. IDO1- and PD-L1–specific T-cell responses were expanded in the vaccine arm versus the pembrolizumab arm, reinforcing the therapy’s proposed immune-modulatory mechanism.

“Despite the narrow miss on statistical significance, I am encouraged by the clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival observed with IO102-IO103 plus pembrolizumab. The consistency of findings across subgroups, together with the manageable safety profile and convenient administration, supports continued exploration of IO102-IO103 as a potential option for patients. I am particularly excited about the encouraging outcomes seen in patients with PD-L1–negative tumors across multiple endpoints,” said Jessica Hassel, MD, Professor at the Department of Dermatology and National Center for Tumor Diseases at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, and lead enrolling investigator for the Phase 3 trial.

Phase 2 Basket Trial in NSCLC and SCCHN

Also presented at ESMO were final data from the Phase 2 basket trial (IOB-022/KN-D38), evaluating Cylembio in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%) or SCCHN (PD-L1 CPS ≥20).

Among 49 efficacy-evaluable patients (31 with NSCLC and 18 with SCCHN), mPFS was 8.1 months at 21.4 months of follow-up in NSCLC and 7.0 months at 18 months of follow-up in SCCHN, with durable responses and encouraging 18-month overall survival (OS) rates. The combination’s safety profile remained consistent with anti–PD-1 monotherapy, with no new safety signals.

The Great Reckoning by Kaiser Kuo- The Ideas Letter

This is a tough read, but a must read.

In conversations I’ve had over the last few months in Beijing with professionals spanning various industries, from biotech to automotive, from renewable energy to humanoid robotics, I’ve heard variations of the same observation: The transformation that has swept through their sectors in China over the past two decades—or even just the past five years—would be utterly unfathomable to anyone who hasn’t witnessed it firsthand. They describe returning from conferences in the United States or Europe struck by a disconnect: The tsunami of transformation coming from China just isn’t felt with an urgency remotely commensurate with the scale of the disruption in store.

If you’re talking or writing about energy and not talking about what China’s doing, then you’re simply not comprehending the scale and the magnitude of what they’ve achieved. It’s extraordinary and probably without parallel — or at least with very few parallels — in the history of the world.

In the US, we have started — just begun really — to reckon with this fact:

… the painful recognition that another system, however flawed, has delivered results on a scale that the United States has not. This is to me, as an American, a source of not inconsiderable anguish. I take no pleasure in witnessing what my country has become—a nation I love, torn apart by political tribalism so intense and so toxic that I fear it may be beyond repair, at least in the coming, and critical, decade.

But confronting this crisis requires looking squarely at what seems so unsettling about China’s success. As Chas W. Freeman, a retired senior U.S. diplomat, has observed, “Americans now exhibit an odd combination of self-doubt, complacency, and hubris”— a mix that has prevented the kind of clear-eyed assessment the moment requires.

We are in denial about how rapidly China is outpacing us in energy: building a terawatt of power every two or three years while we’re on pace to add a terawatt… in two decades.

And they’re exporting not only solar panels and wind turbines and batteries all over the world, but EVs, too — the Chinese are absolutely dominating that industry globally. We have not yet reckoned with much of this. But we need to — and fast.

Factors Influencing Recent Trends in Retail Electricity Prices in the United States | Lawrence Berkley National Labs

This presentation is one of the most important and useful presentations you’ll see this year. There are many reasons why electricity costs go up or down: it defies simple explanations.

But we can find some signal in the noise of data, summarized here. One of those: “market-based” wind and solar drive prices down. It’s astounding to me that some still dispute this. Extreme weather and the need to harden the grid drive prices up. Higher natural gas prices increase electricity prices and vice versa:

Other key takeaways: the charts you see with sharply increasing cost curves for electricity do not factor in inflation and don’t take a long enough view. Adjusted for inflation, the national average for electricity prices in 2024 was less than in 2010.

But that’s an average. Residential customers have seen higher cost increases than large commercial and industrial customers:","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!chme!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21e58931-b829-4db9-8f15-028d43d94554_1576x1712.png",N,,2025-10-20 08:11:14.872449

“It’s fair to say that electricity prices track natural gas prices,” he said.
“Any upward swing in gas prices is bad news for electricity prices,” he said.
Due largely to natural gas, supply costs have become the most volatile and largest component of an electric bill.
Solar, wind and battery storage deployed at certain hours can help dampen the volatility of natural gas, they said.","Most Maine homes and small businesses can expect the cost of their electricity supply to go up in January.

Nine out of 10 Maine homes receive their electricity supply through the state-run standard offer program. They’re likely to see an estimated 15 percent or so jump in rates, according to an analysis done for The Maine Monitor by Competitive Energy Services, a Portland consulting and energy procurement firm.

The projected increase could boost average supply rates for a typical home by roughly $8 a month in 2026.

The supply rate hike would be separate from whatever happens with a recent, controversial request by Central Maine Power to increase its distribution rates to upgrade its aging network of wires, poles and substations. That proposal, now at the Public Utilities Commission, has been met with strong opposition from inflation-weary customers, triggering a record 617 public comments by early October.

“Affordability is becoming a big issue, a big political issue,” said Andrew Price, Competitive Energy Services’ president and CEO. “There’s definitely outrage out there with CMP’s proposed distribution increases. The supply hike is going to feel like there’s some piling on.”

Rising electric rates are becoming a national issue, too, with the prices consumers pay up 13 percent since 2022 and projected to rise again next year, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, a non-partisan branch of the U.S. Department of Energy. In some regions, the growth is tied to building more power plants to meet demand at new data centers.

But Maine’s expected supply cost increase has nothing to do with artificial intelligence or CMP’s case. Instead, it’s tied largely to wholesale natural gas prices that are on track to keep rising in 2026.

Prices are up in part because the United States, which has become the world’s largest gas exporter, is projected to double the volume of liquefied natural gas shipped overseas by 2030, according to federal estimates. LNG exports are part of President Donald Trump’s goal of unleashing a “Golden Era of American Energy Dominance,” growing the country’s gross domestic product and adding jobs.

But higher natural gas prices are bad for energy consumers in New England. That’s because half the region’s power is generated by plants that burn natural gas. The cost of gas in turn sets what’s called the marginal price for what other forms of generation are paid for supplying New England’s power grid 24/7.

Wholesale gas prices are being watched closely now because the Maine PUC is planning next month to review the annual bids it receives from generators offering the standard supply service in 2026. There’s no way to know the precise outcome until the days the bids are accepted, but market conditions are pointing to some increase, according to Philip Bartlett, who chairs the PUC.

“It’s fair to say that electricity prices track natural gas prices,” he said. “So if we see changes in natural gas prices, they will be reflected in electricity costs.”

Electricity suppliers study cost projections on energy futures markets, and if they see gas prices rising next year, Bartlett explained, they hedge that risk by charging more for generation contracts.

“Any upward swing in gas prices is bad news for electricity prices,” he said.

Supply rates have been volatile

Mainers have received their electricity supply from an unregulated energy market for 25 years, although some residents still think their utilities are involved because the charges are included in their monthly bills. Due largely to natural gas, supply costs have become the most volatile and largest component of an electric bill.

And they’ve been on a roller coaster in recent years, ranging from roughly 6 cents per kilowatt-hour to 16 cents. They plunged during the pandemic in 2020, soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled global energy markets, and have eased over the past two years.

Today, according to the latest figures collected by Maine’s Department of Energy Resources, standard offer supply rates are roughly 11 cents per kWh for CMP and Versant Power’s Bangor Hydro District.

Maine’s total electric rates grew at the third fastest rate in the country between 2014 and 2024, according to an analysis conducted last April by The Monitor. An overly generous state solar reimbursement policy and the costs of repairing the delivery grid following severe storms were contributors, but natural gas prices were the leading factor, the analysis found.

New England is especially vulnerable to price swings because the region’s constrained gas pipeline system doesn’t have enough capacity on the coldest winter days, requiring injections of more-costly LNG to meet demand.

The role of LNG

But LNG now is playing a role in pushing up electricity prices elsewhere in the country. As aging coal plants have retired, natural gas has become America’s leading fuel for electricity generation, meeting 42 percent of the need. At the same time, a growing share of American gas is being shipped overseas from new export terminals.

It’s headed primarily to Europe, for cutting dependence on Russian energy. And it’s going to Asia, to meet growing energy needs and to blunt tariff pressures from the Trump administration. Recent data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Finance Analysis, which promotes sustainable energy, found that, for the first time, the volume of gas being exported was more than half the amount being used at American power plants.

Although gas production and prices are always changing, the overall trend is pushing up the price of gas burned in America. The federal Energy Information Administration’s October outlook projected that a key market price used to forecast costs would rise from $2.20 per million BTU last year to $4.10 in January.

The idea that exports are pushing up gas prices isn’t universally embraced. The American Petroleum Institute, for instance, recently highlighted a report from S&P Global that found LNG exports had no major impact on domestic residential gas prices, although that report didn’t directly address the influence on electricity rates.

Campaigning last year, Trump said he intended to slash energy and electricity prices in half within 12 to 18 months. And while gasoline prices have eased a bit this year due to lower crude oil costs, electricity generation has gone in the other direction.

“We’re not on track for any Trump policies to cut electric rates for Maine ratepayers,” said Heather Sanborn, Maine’s public advocate for utility customers.

Sanborn said her office hears daily from Mainers concerned about affordable power but that the state has limited tools to address supply costs. One strategy, endorsed by her office and AARP Maine, is to explore different methods for the PUC to procure standard offer contracts.

A bill passed this year in the Maine Legislature directs the PUC to look into soliciting bids more than once a year and for varying lengths of time, in an effort to smooth the volatility in rates.

Asked about the effort, Bartlett said his agency contracted for a procurement study that recommended minor adjustments but “nothing earthshattering” that would significantly lower supply costs for Mainers. A report to the Legislature is due in January.

One strategy that could help over time, both Sanborn and Bartlett noted, is to build more cost-effective renewable energy capacity in the region. Solar, wind and battery storage deployed at certain hours can help dampen the volatility of natural gas, they said. Solar, for instance, can reduce the time gas plants need to run when demand is high, such as on a summer afternoon when air conditioners are cranking.

But federal support for clean energy has largely evaporated, especially for solar and wind, with the Trump administration doing what it can to hamstring renewable projects in favor of fossil fuel generation.

“To the extent we’re not building grid-scale storage or offshore wind, we are allowing natural gas to be the marginal cost setter in our region,” Sanborn said.",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/electricity-meter.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 07:03:50.281043

Pritti MistryBusiness reporter

The government has announced plans to train and recruit more workers for the UK's clean energy sector, promising to create 400,000 extra jobs by 2030.

Plumbers, electricians and welders are among 31 priority occupations that are ""particularly in demand"", with employment in renewable, wind, solar and nuclear expected to double to 860,000 in five years, ministers have said.

Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said thousands of jobs were needed to develop Britain's clean energy sector to ""get bills down for good"".

Welcoming the proposals, Unite the union said: ""Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition.""

As part of the government's strategy, five ""technical excellence colleges"" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, with £2.5m in funding going towards pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire, and Pembrokeshire, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).

A new programme is to be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations, while oil and gas workers could benefit from up to £20m from the UK and Scottish governments for bespoke careers training in clean energy roles.

There would be also be tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed.

He said 10,000 extra jobs would be needed to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk and described how the Siemen's wind turbine factory in Hull was ""booming"".

Miliband also told the BBC he stood by his pledge to reduce energy bills by £300 by 2030, after bills went up by 2% for millions across the UK under Ofgem's latest price cap, which sets the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of gas and electricity for millions of househoulds in England, Scotland and Wales.

The increase for October to the end of December means a household using a typical amount of energy will pay £1,755 a year, up £35 a year.

In a statement, Miliband said the plan would bring ""a new generation of good industrial jobs"" to communities across the UK.

""Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

""Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.""

According to DESNZ, jobs in the clean energy sector command average salaries of more than £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: ""We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry, and will drive growth across the nation.

""Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future.""

Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said the government's strategy could ""help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs"".

""Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future,"" she added.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3836/live/0c7a8520-accb-11f0-8be0-edba131ad73f.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 07:03:36.907099

This Substack post from Matthew Yglesias on climate policy gets, I think two things right and one thing wrong. And getting those three components of climate policy correct is, I believe, important to long term, politically sustainable success in addressing climate change.

First, as Yglesias correctly notes, climate change is not a priority for most voters. The polling data on this has been consistent over time. While a majority of Americans want to do something about climate change, it never ranks particularly high on the list of priorities for voters. That in turn means that policy tools such as carbon taxes are very difficult to enact and sustain over time. It means that efforts to use large-scale political mobilization to push elected officials to take action face major hurdles, and will be difficult to sustain over time. And it means (and this is not unique to the US at all), that policy efforts to reduce fossil fuel combustion (as opposed to accelerating clean energy innovation and deployment) will also be generally politically unpopular and hard to sustain.

Second, Yglesias is also correct that much of the progress we have made in terms of decarbonization has resulted from dramatic drops in the cost, and improvements in the quality, of clean energy technologies, allowing them to be deployed at scale, and allowing for them to displace fossil fuel combustion without affirmative policy efforts to shrink fossil fuel usage.

But the third point is one that I think Yglesias is wrong about. He makes a claim that climate policy would be improved with “much less emphasis on marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions, and much more emphasis on trying to solve the remaining hard problems of climate change on a technical level.” But that ignores two key points. First, much of the progress in innovation in clean energy resulted from policy choices, such as research and development support, tax credits, regulatory programs such as renewable portfolio standards, and feed in tariffs. And in fact much of the improvement for these technologies came from not just the innovation, but also supporting the expanding deployment of these technologies. Increased deployment produces “learning by doing” that has been a major driver of many of the cost reductions for these technologies. “Marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions” may well have the impact of making those good solutions even better.

Second is Yglesias’s focus on broader public opinion. He is absolutely correct that public opinion is a key constraint on climate policy. But there are many other actors and sources of influence in policymaking besides just basic public opinion. Interest groups can be very important, particularly on issues that are not high salience for voters. And climate policy can have the effect of building up interest group power. Renewable energy companies were big losers in IRA repeal, but the counterfactual where there is not a relatively powerful renewable energy industry to lobby against repeal is likely a repeal that is much harsher to clean energy. And interest group pressure is a key reason why very conservative states like Texas have not (yet) mimicked the Trump Administration to impose punitive regulations or taxes on renewable energy. So again, “marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions” maybe important for climate policy because of its impacts on the political landscape.

In the end, the lessons I take from these three points is that successful climate policy will often be quiet climate policy. It will not principally be driven by broad public mobilization, and it will be cognizant of political constraints in terms of its structure and direction. But it very different from a retreat from policy to entirely focusing on bleeding-edge technological innovation – something that is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of decarbonization.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/openGraphLogo.png,N,,2025-10-19 07:04:35.982738

Five ""technical excellence colleges"" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, the Government said.
""The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.
""In this context, is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.
Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ""Today's announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system.","The British government has unveiled the first-ever national plan to train and recruit workers who can fill the skills gap in the clean energy transition.

The strategy, published on Sunday, outlines how the Government will deliver on its promise for more than 400,000 extra jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, doubling the existing opportunities.

Under the plans, ministers have identified 31 priority occupations that are particularly in demand, such as plumbers, electricians and welders.

Five ""technical excellence colleges"" will be set up to train workers with clean energy skills, the Government said.

A new programme will also be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations – as will tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed.

Elsewhere, the plans say oil and gas workers will be able to benefit from up to £20 million ($27 million) from the UK and Scottish Governments for bespoke careers training in clean energy roles.

And the ""energy skills passport,"" which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to transition into offshore wind, will be extended to new sectors, including nuclear and the electricity grid.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: ""Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs.

""The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

""Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

""Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

""This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.""

In the plan, the Government will set out how trade unions will be a key part of its jobs drive by recognising their role in securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

This includes a new ""fair work charter"" between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure firms benefitting from public funding provide good wages and strong workplace rights.

Ministers said they will also look to close loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: ""We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry, and will drive growth across the nation.

""Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future.""

It comes as part of the Government's wider efforts to boost economic growth and decarbonise the UK's electricity grid by the end of the decade.

Ministers say their decision to greenlight the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, while it announced Rolls-Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs.

Elsewhere, the Acorn and Viking carbon capture and storage projects (CCUS) in development in Scotland and the North East will support a combined 35,000 jobs, the Government estimates, building on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in other CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said: ""This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.

""Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles.

""Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.""

Sue Ferns, Prospect senior deputy general secretary, said: ""If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development.

""In this context, is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.

""However, the scale of the challenge of training new workers and supporting existing workers, including those looking to transition from other roles, requires both more resource and co-ordinated effort across government.""

Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ""Today's announcement is a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system.

""It rightly recognises the need to tackle the skills challenge collectively by investing in both new talent and our existing workforce.""

Jane Cooper, deputy chief executive at Renewable UK, said: ""This long-awaited plan delivers on employers' calls for a coherent Government workforce strategy for clean energy and we look forward to working with Ministers to realise its ambitions.""",https://ia.tmgrup.com.tr/ca4f0e/806/378/0/131/2048/1090?u=https://i.tmgrup.com.tr/anews/v1/2025/10/19/uk-unveils-national-plan-to-recruit-workers-for-energy-transition-1760860313312.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 05:02:59.240847

In June, a judge ordered the administration to release funding appropriated to Illinois and 13 other states, according to a press release.

Following the successful lawsuit, the state announced that $18.4 million would be awarded to build 25 charging stations for electric vehicles along interstate corridors.

Renewable Energy Magazine said that the charging station project will advance Illinois' goal to have 1 million EVs registered by 2030.

Because EVs produce no tailpipe pollution, they help contribute to cleaner air for communities. Traditional vehicles spew out harmful carbon pollution that has been tied to health problems, including respiratory diseases and cognitive decline.

These same pollutants are also to blame for the overheating of our planet. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, transportation-related pollution accounts for 28% of the country's planet-heating pollution — this makes this sector the worst when it comes to its climate contributions.

NEVI was made possible with the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021.

The signing took place during the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum 2025 in Abuja, marking one of the country’s largest coordinated commitments to clean energy expansion.

Vice President Kashim Shettima, who officiated the event, said the agreements are central to Nigeria’s plan to achieve 277 gigawatts of installed power capacity by 2060 and position the country as a renewable energy manufacturing hub for Africa. He explained that Nigeria’s energy transition represents an investment opportunity exceeding $410 billion between now and 2060, with about $23 billion required in the near term to connect millions of households still living without reliable access to electricity.

Shettima said that the shift toward renewable energy demands more than financial investment. It requires innovation, local capacity, and long-term commitment to building sustainable value chains. He emphasised that the government’s industrial strategy aims to anchor Africa’s renewable energy supply chains within Nigeria through domestic production of solar panels, battery storage systems, and smart meters, supported by technology transfer and local skill development.

The vice president noted that the new investments are expected to create about 1,500 direct jobs across participating states and strengthen Nigeria’s clean energy manufacturing base. He highlighted the role of the Federal Ministry of Power and the Rural Electrification Agency in steering policies that promote decentralised, competitive, and inclusive electricity access, particularly in off-grid and underserved regions.

At the forum, state governments entered into agreements with local and international renewable energy firms to develop solar, hybrid, and recycling projects aimed at increasing electricity generation capacity. These include partnerships that will add hundreds of megawatts to the national grid, establish recycling plants for renewable components, and expand the country’s manufacturing base for clean energy technologies.

Shettima reaffirmed President Bola Tinubu’s commitment to consolidating Nigeria’s energy transition policies through incentives for local manufacturing, streamlined regulatory processes, and enhanced collaboration among state governments, private investors, and development partners. He added that the success of Nigeria’s energy transition would not be measured by policies or projections, but by the country’s ability to turn plans into tangible outcomes that guarantee reliability, affordability, and sustainability for all citizens.

He also called on development partners and equipment manufacturers to localise production, strengthen supply chains, and invest in human capital to ensure that the benefits of renewable energy are widely shared.

Industry analysts say the agreements come at a defining moment for Nigeria’s power sector. Despite reforms aimed at improving grid efficiency, millions still lack access to electricity, particularly in rural and peri-urban communities. Expanding renewable energy infrastructure, they argue, could help reduce dependence on diesel generation and support inclusive economic growth.

A generation of young people across Britain will benefit from the good jobs and high wages that the booming clean energy economy can bring, under new plans announced by the government today as part of the clean energy superpower mission

Backed by record government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK – with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, government will today (Sunday 19 October) publish a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

See the Clean Energy Jobs Plan

Setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how this government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90’s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: 'Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen. Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.'

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said: 'We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation. Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change. The government’s clean energy mission is already delivering for the UK, with the certainty and stability of the government’s mission having galvanised over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

'The government has also given Sizewell C the green light, which will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, announced Rolls Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs, and kickstarted the Acorn and the Viking projects in Scotland and the North East that is estimated to support a combined 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships. This builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

'For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors. Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.'

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50% today.

With at least 1 in 6 ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.??

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 60,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.?

Under the Government plans, Scotland could see an increase of up to 40,000 jobs by 2030.","The Government has unveiled a new national plan to train and recruit more than 400,000 workers over five years for the clean energy sector.

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan, published on Sunday, is aimed at training up the next generation of clean energy workers and doubling the existing workforce.

Ministers have identified 31 priority occupations that are particularly in demand, including plumbers, electricians and welders.

It also includes plans for five ""technical excellence colleges"", aimed at training the next generation of green energy workers, while also fulfilling the Government's drive for two-thirds of young people to be in higher-level learning.

Existing workers will also be provided with training to transfer their skills over to the sector, under the new plans.

A new programme will be launched to match veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories and nuclear power stations, as well as tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed.

Up to £20 million will also be allotted to ""upskill"" existing oil and gas workers into the clean energy sector.

And the “energy skills passport,” which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to transition into offshore wind, will be extended to new sectors, including nuclear and the electricity grid.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

“Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

Under the Government plans, Scotland could see an increase of up to 40,000 jobs by 2030. Wales could see up to 15,000 and Northern Ireland up to 2,500.

The North of England could also see up to 60,000 jobs generated over five years.

In the plan, the Government will set out how trade unions will be a key part of its jobs drive by recognising their role in securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

This includes a new “fair work charter” between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure firms benefitting from public funding provide good wages and strong workplace rights.

Ministers said they will also look to close loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: “We’re giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry, and will drive growth across the nation.

“Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future.”

The new plan is part of the Government's wider efforts to boost economic growth and decarbonise the UK's electricity grid by the end of the decade.

Ministers say their decision to greenlight the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk will support 10,000 jobs at peak construction, while it announced Rolls-Royce as the preferred bidder for the small modular reactor programme to support up to 3,000 jobs.

Elsewhere, the Acorn and Viking carbon capture and storage projects (CCUS) in development in Scotland and the North East will support a combined 35,000 jobs, the Government estimates.

Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said: “This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.

“Extra investment for retraining will mean experienced staff already employed in the sector are able to take on new roles.

“Additional funding for apprenticeships and opportunities for young people are crucial too if the UK is to have a bright and clean energy future.”

Sue Ferns, Prospect senior deputy general secretary, said: “If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development.

“In this context, is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.

“However, the scale of the challenge of training new workers and supporting existing workers, including those looking to transition from other roles, requires both more resource and coordinated effort across government.”

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan, published on Sunday (19 October), outlines how government investment and private partnerships aim to double the UK’s clean energy workforce to 860,000 by the end of the decade.

The strategy identifies 31 priority occupations – including electricians, welders, plumbers, and engineers – as critical to meeting the UK’s growing demand for renewable energy infrastructure and carbon-cutting technology.

In Wales, clean energy employment is projected to rise from around 5,000 in 2023 to about 20,000 by 2030. Key areas for job growth include offshore wind, carbon capture, hydrogen, and power grid upgrades.

North Wales and Flintshire projects leading growth

Several major projects are expected to anchor this growth in North Wales. The HyNet carbon capture and storage (CCUS) project, spanning Flintshire, Cheshire and North Wales, is forecast to create around 2,800 direct jobs. The Mona Offshore Wind Farm, located off the North Wales coast, will provide an estimated 3,500 roles over its lifetime.

Both schemes are backed by public and private investment and are seen as central to the region’s shift towards a low-carbon economy.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.”

Training and skills investment

To prepare the workforce, five new Technical Excellence Colleges will be established across the UK to train young people in key clean energy skills. Wales will also receive a share of £2.5 million in funding for regional training programmes, careers advice, and community-based skills projects.

The plan also includes targeted schemes for groups who can help fill skills gaps. A new partnership with Mission Renewable will match military veterans with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine assembly, and nuclear energy.

Tailored programmes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and unemployed people are also being developed. Government data shows that more than 13,000 people who were out of work last year already had the skills needed for key clean energy roles such as engineering and skilled trades.

For existing workers in oil and gas, the plan provides up to £20 million in funding from the UK and Scottish Governments to help people retrain for clean energy roles. The “Energy Skills Passport”, already used in offshore wind, will be expanded to cover nuclear and grid sectors, simplifying career transitions.

Jack Sargeant, Welsh Government Minister for Skills, said: “Our ambition is to ensure today’s young people will have the skills needed to work the jobs of tomorrow, helping us embed the industries and services of the future in our communities.

“With decades of industrial expertise, Wales is primed to capitalise on the generational opportunity that is the UK’s clean energy revolution. The plan announced today will complement our Net Zero Skills Action Plan and support our journey to a cleaner, more prosperous Wales.”

Fair pay and secure employment

The plan also introduces measures to ensure clean energy jobs deliver fair pay and good working conditions. These include closing loopholes in employment law to extend minimum-wage protections to offshore clean energy workers, and a new Fair Work Charter for offshore wind developers.

Michael Lewis, Chief Executive of Uniper, which operates the Connah’s Quay Power Station in Flintshire, said: “Uniper aims to invest approximately €8 billion into growth and transformation projects by the early 2030s, including solar, hydrogen and carbon capture projects such as our Connah’s Quay development. We recognise the need for workers to have the right skills now, and in the future, to support the UK’s and our own ambitions.”

The UK Government said clean energy jobs will offer average salaries of over £50,000 a year – around 23% higher than comparable roles in other sectors.

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan aims to create skilled, well-paid work while supporting the transition to a secure, low-carbon energy future for communities across Wales.

“We’re really going to see nuclear move again. Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.

Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.

He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.

“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said.

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.

Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County.

Detroit has announced plans for a new US$40 million multimodal transit hub inside the 30-acre Michigan Central Innovation District. The project will bring together passenger rail, intercity bus, and local transit, connecting the Detroit–Ann Arbor Innovation Corridor, Detroit Metro Airport, and Toronto.

The Michigan Department of Transport (MDOT), Michigan Central, and the City of Detroit have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to begin early design and engineering work on the project. Partners will use a US$10 million Federal Transit Administration RAISE grant awarded to MDOT and US$30 million in state funds. Decisions about final project designs, funding, and timelines will be shared as the exploratory phase progresses.

“Downtown Detroit is open for business and on the move as one of the best places to live, work, and pioneer cutting-edge ideas,” said Michigan’s Governor, Gretchen Whitmer. “Today’s MOU lays the foundation for a new multimodal transit hub that will grow our regional economy, make downtown Detroit more vibrant, and connect residents and visitors to our communities. It builds on a historic investment in transit.”

According to the partners, the proposed hub will expand access, attract investment, and position Detroit as a leader in the region’s transit future. The project supports economic opportunities by strengthening the region’s interconnected innovation ecosystem, including a proposed extension of the Chicago-Detroit Amtrak Wolverine train to Windsor and Toronto.

“As Detroit’s innovation ecosystem grows at an unprecedented rate, our transit infrastructure must evolve alongside it, by linking entrepreneurs and companies to emerging innovation zones and the opportunities they unlock,” said Josh Sirefman, CEO of Michigan Central. “This is just another step in positioning Michigan Central as the hub that not only connects people to possibility but drives regional growth.”

MDOT currently owns and operates the Howard Street bus station, which serves Greyhound, Indian Trails, Baron’s Bus, and the Amtrak station in the New Center neighbourhood. Each of these facilities has passed its useful lifespan and does not offer the amenities and functionality expected by modern travellers. The proposed hub would provide passengers with a more vibrant and accessible location with modern amenities.

“This is a positive step to further develop Michigan Central into a true transit hub and innovation ecosystem,” said Bradley Wieferich, State Transport Director. “We look forward to working with partners Michigan Central, the City of Detroit and others to make this a reality.”

Sam Krassenstein, Chief of Infrastructure for the City of Detroit, said the project would help restore the area’s historic role as the city’s main transport gateway. “For decades, Michigan Central Station was the gateway to Detroit, and we are excited to begin the work of re-establishing train service at a new multi-modal transit facility in the shadow of the station,” he said.

The partners said final project details, including designs and public engagement opportunities, will be developed and shared as planning moves forward.",https://cities-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dreamstime_s_130606486.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 03:59:06.921024

The UK Government has launched a new national plan to ensure Britain has the workforce needed to power the green energy transition.

It sets a pathway to creating 40,000 new clean energy jobs in Scotland by 2030, with the total number of people employed in the sector across the UK expected to double to 860,000.

The plan identifies 31 “priority occupations”, including in skilled trades such as plumbing, welding and electrician.

The Scottish Government has announced £9m extra for its existing oil and gas transition training fund over the next three years, to be matched by the UK Government, taking the total to nearly £20m.

UK ministers also plan to promote trade union membership in workplaces and create a new ‘fair work charter’ to ensure companies benefiting from public funding provide good wages and employment rights.

UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities across Scotland have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen and places Scotland at the very heart of the clean energy revolution this government is delivering.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in Scotland can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.”

The plan includes initiatives to upskill existing oil and gas workers to help them move to new roles in the green economy, such as via the green skills passport, as well as targeted efforts to match veterans, ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed with jobs.

Scottish Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: “Scotland’s innovation, expertise and vast renewable energy resources will not only benefit the planet – but deliver new economic opportunities and new jobs for households and communities across the country… We will continue to explore how best to support Scotland’s energy skills transition, working closely with the UK Government on options like guaranteed interview schemes, redeployment pools and skills passporting.”

Carbon capture and storage is expected to create 15,000 jobs in Scotland, while investment in transmission infrastructure if project to support 17,500 jobs.

Offshore wind, including supply chain firms, are also expected to create a significant number of new roles.

The move has been welcomed by several trade unions, with Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, saying: “This represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy – as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

The United States is hopelessly broken, with red states and blue states at each other’s throats more and more. Not since the Civil War has the country been so divided, with one half of states determined to promote an inclusive society that honors the contributions of all citizens and the other half equally determined to construct a white male dominated society that punishes anyone who lost the lottery of life at birth or prays to the wrong god.

About the only branch of government that still functions as the Founders envisioned is the court system, and even that has been badly compromised by a slew of MAGA judges who are sworn to uphold the madness of King Donald, no matter what the law says. Today we have liberty and justice for white males and prison or deportation for everyone else.

Reuters reports that nearly two dozen states are now suing the administration over its cancellation of the $7 billion Solar For All grants meant to expand access to solar energy in low-income communities. It was also intended to expand community solar initiatives, which bring solar power to people who don’t own their own homes or otherwise can’t install their own solar panels.

The program was projected to help 900,000 households access solar energy so they could reduce their use of fossil fuels and lower their utility bills. The participating households were expected to collectively save more than $350 million each year on utility costs. Of course, the savings would come from burning less methane and coal, and we can’t have that, not when the federal government is a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry.

The majority of those 900,000 households were located in so-called red states, so you might think the Solar For All program would be welcome across the country. Not so. It turns out that while the federal government is shoveling $90 billion to a handful of tech billionaires to help them build data centers, the idea of helping low- and moderate-income Americans is too horrifying for MAGAlomaniacs to even contemplate. So the EPA — led by presidential jock sniffer Lee Zeldin — is planning to claw back the $7 billion promised by the Solar For All initiative. We’ve got to find the money for those tech bros somewhere, after all.

On October 16, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced two lawsuits by a group of states that were previously approved grants under the Solar for All program. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the termination of the program in August, calling it a “boondoggle.” [But apparently propping up a dictator in Argentina with 40 billion taxpayer dollars is not. Lying is all these people know.]

California will lose around $250 million in funding approved by Congress for the Solar For All program. “The administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies. In doing so, [it] is making America more expensive and more polluted,” Bonta said.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said cancellation of the program would impact 11,000 households in Arizona and cause their utility bills to jump by 20 percent after the state lost $156 million in Solar for All funding. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said.

She added that cancellation of the program would hit disadvantaged communities the hardest, citing the Hopi tribe of northern Arizona which was slated to get a $25 million award to bring electricity to the community. For many tribal members, it would be the first time ever that they had electricity in their homes.

The complaints were filed 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions sued to restore the Solar For All program. In addition to California and Arizona, states participating in the lawsuits include Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the city of Washington, D.C.

Federal Judge In Louisiana Tosses LNG Terminal Permit

In other court related news of interest to CleanTechnica readers, Jack Brook of The Hill reported on October 16, 2025 that Judge Penelope Richard of Louisiana state court has invalidated a key permit for a liquefied natural gas facility in Cameron Parish that was approved by the administration earlier this year. The ruling ordered the state to review how planet-warming emissions from the LNG facility would affect Gulf Coast communities that are vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather. Three of America’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.” Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, added, “This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for a Commonwealth LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts.”

Earlier this year, energy secretary Chris “Mad Dog” Wright reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of LNG as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote US “energy dominance.” Jennifer Granholm, who served as Biden’s energy secretary, had warned a year ago that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would lead to a dangerous increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.” Louisiana’s attorney general Liz Murrill sputtered and fumed while vowing to appeal the decision that vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility. “Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest. In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.

But Judge Richard rejected that position, ruling that state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with other similar facilities clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity, and sea-level rise in a state where land area equivalent to a football field disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — “defining characteristic” of the parish, she said. The LNG terminal could destroy marshes, harm water quality, and displace residents, but “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities,” the judge wrote in her decision.

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, told The Hill he applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry. “The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.” Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oysters, crabs, and fish.

How long do you think will be before some higher court in Louisiana — the most polluted state in the US — overturns Judge Richard’s decision? A week? A month? You can bet it won’t take long as Louisiana continues to throw its citizens under the bus to please the oil and gas industries.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/solar-wap-liheap-body-e1719446207618.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 01:03:58.972722

More than 40,000 new jobs are to be created for Scots under the UK government’s clean energy mission plans.

Today, the UK government will publish a national plan to train thousands of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.

Labour claims it puts the nation at the heart of the government’s drive to deliver a new generation of clean energy jobs.

Key skills needed include construction, electricians, bricklayers and plumbers, engineers and metal workers.

The largest clean energy employers are expected to be in carbon capture as well as offshore and onshore wind.

Setting out plans today, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities across Scotland have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs.

“The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen and places

Scotland at the very heart of the clean energy revolution this government is delivering.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.”

Welcoming the jobs boost, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: “After over a decade of SNP and Tory failure, the Labour government is investing in Scotland’s future and creating the industrial jobs of the future that Scotland needs.

The age of SNP and Tory inaction is over – this is a UK Labour government standing up for Scottish industry and Scottish workers.

“Scotland needs a Scottish Government serious about creating jobs in Scotland and delivering an industrial strategy to secure our future.”

Oil and gas workers are set to benefit from up to £20million from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in the sector.

Scottish Government Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: “This continued and expanded funding to the Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund will support more offshore workers to take on different roles across the sustainable energy sector over the next three years – helping to deliver a fair and managed transition to the sector.”

Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said: “After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy - as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.”",https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article35215597.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_offshore-wind-park-north-sea.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 05:03:39.426582

Their concerns congregate around worries that the clean power transition will not treat oil and gas, and other industrial workers fairly.
By laying out a clear four year strategy for clean power jobs, the Energy Secretary hopes to assuage those concerns.
Clean Power companies have grown under the government’s renewed charge towards green energy: this stipulation in Miliband’s Clean Power Jobs plan will encourage them to give back.
Indeed, GMB has looked favourably on Miliband’s new Clean Jobs Plan.","After a punchy party conference, Ed Miliband is still running on a high. The Energy Secretary, whose clean power plans are often a target for right-wing ire, has now managed to win over some of his fiercest critics: the unions.

Today the government has unveiled the UK’s first ever national clean jobs plan. With this long-awaited strategy, the government hopes to create 400,000 extra jobs in 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and wielders. If everything goes to plan, under Miliband’s new scheme, by 2030, employment is expected to double to 860,000. Oil and gas workers – who are often held up as the so-called victims of the Green Transition – will benefit from up to £20m in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to fund bespoke careers training.

But more interestingly, this plan signals a clear leftward shift from Miliband (who is often held up as a vanguard of the ‘soft-left’ in the cabinet). The plan also includes several key employment rights measures that trade unions have long been calling for. And as a result, it has been enthusiastically backed by some of net zero’s loudest critics within the trade union movement, including representatives from GMB, Unite, Prospect, Community and a raft of others. Their concerns congregate around worries that the clean power transition will not treat oil and gas, and other industrial workers fairly. By laying out a clear four year strategy for clean power jobs, the Energy Secretary hopes to assuage those concerns.

As part of the offer to the unions, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will close the current loophole in employment rights legislation which means that those working further than 12 miles offshore do not benefit from the full raft of workers’ rights. This will provide serious benefits for those working in offshore wind and is intended to help attract more people to the sector.

The department will also set up new fair work charters which stipulate that if a clean power company (in offshore wind, or solar power, for example) wants to take up the government’s clean energy bonus, they must be able to provide clear evidence that they have good industrial relations and have a recognised union for employees. Clean Power companies have grown under the government’s renewed charge towards green energy: this stipulation in Miliband’s Clean Power Jobs plan will encourage them to give back.

Miliband described this as a “landmark national plan” and added that he hopes the government’s new measures will mean “if we get this right, we will create an economy where there is no need to leave your hometown to find a decent job”. Sources close to the Energy Secretary told the New Statesman that this is crucial to taking the fight to Reform. (Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, is often heard in the Commons describing the government’s plans as “net stupid zero”). By focusing heavily on maintaining good industrial relations – especially on clean power – the government hopes to expose Reform’s double-standards and its unsustainable plans for British workers. Under the government’s logic, Reform would allow business as usual and continued drilling, despite the fact that in 2024, less than half of the UK’s oil and gas came from the North Sea. In fact, by 2027, it is estimated that the UK will be 95 per cent reliant on imported fossil fuels.

This flagship strategy comes at a particularly testy time for Labour politically. Recent polling for next week’s Caerphilly by-election has put Labour on 12 per cent well behind Reform and Plaid Cymru (42 per cent and 38 per cent respectively). Reform’s campaigning in Wales – which commenced with Nigel Farage’s press conference in June – has included pledges to reopen the coal mines, in direct contravention of Miliband’s clean power vision.

“Reform are campaigning on de-industrialisation, and re-opening the pits,” a source close to the Energy Secretary said, “we see what they’re doing in Wales.” They described the Clean Jobs Plan as a recognition from the government that more needs to be done to bring the unions along with this mission. “Ed is doing very bold stuff: he’s basically saying, you only get public money if you recognise the unions”. Some in the clean energy world have described this move as “class conscious environmentalism”.

This is all part of a realignment of Miliband’s relationship with the unions, hints of which were very clear at the Labour Party conference at the end of September. At a Climate Jobs Alliance drinks reception in Liverpool, Miliband and GMB’s general secretary, Gary Smith, signalled their new, clear alliance. Smith, who has been a fierce critic of Net Zero, told the reception “we know that working class communities are impacted first by the climate crisis”, after which Miliband gave him an avocado as an apparent “sign of their growing bond”. Indeed, GMB has looked favourably on Miliband’s new Clean Jobs Plan.

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer at GMB told the New Statesman, “GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions, and their members will be at the heart of this.” Even Unite’s Sharon Graham – a long standing and vocal critic of Miliband’s net zero mission – is on board. She said, “Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights,” but cautioned, “the actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.”

This is clearly a powerful move by Miliband, and it proves his resilience as a cabinet minister in a particularly turbulent Labour government. Ahead of the Spending Review earlier this year, a raft of negative briefings suggested that Clean Power 2030 could be scaled back. Instead, Miliband’s department was one of the biggest winners.

After September’s reshuffle, rumours emerged that Miliband was almost demoted to Housing Secretary (the post which Steve Reed now inhabits). Instead, he stayed firm. This plan is a clear leftward signal from the Energy Secretary at a time when this government’s direction is under clear scrutiny (Miliband has backed Powell in Labour’s Deputy Leadership race which has been viewed by some as a referendum on the government’s political alignment). Could this be a signal from the Energy Secretary that in order to win the battle with Reform, Labour must return to its roots?",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/18/gettyimages-2185394124-800x418.jpg?1760839207,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:19.825649

Momentum Grows as Bushra Amiwala Unites Youth Leaders, Faith Groups, and Local Advocates Behind Her Campaign

SKOKIE, IL — Bushra Amiwala, candidate for Congress in Illinois’ 9th District, today announced new endorsements from Next Gen Politics (IL and National Chapters), and the Northern Illinois American Muslim Alliance (NIAMA) — reflecting her continued success in bringing together young leaders, faith communities, and civic advocates from across the district.

These new endorsements build on Amiwala’s growing record of uniting diverse constituencies — from grassroots youth movements to established community leaders — around a campaign defined by service, inclusion, and capable leadership.

“I’m honored to have the support of these organizations and their members,” said Amiwala.

“They each represent the best of our district — engaged citizens, faith leaders, and organizers who care deeply about building a fairer, more inclusive future. We’re working together to ensure that every voice in this district is heard and represented.”

Next Gen Politics, a youth-led advocacy group, endorsed Amiwala for her record as one of the nation’s first Gen Z elected officials and her ongoing commitment to mentoring young people in civic life.

“Bushra Amiwala represents the new generation of leaders—compassionate, energetic, and deeply connected to her community in Illinois’ 9th District. At Next Gen Politics Illinois, we proudly endorse her because she fights fearlessly for her constituents and isn’t afraid to challenge the status quo,” said Next Gen Politics in a statement. “As the leader of a rapid response team in Skokie, Bushra has actively participated in protests, standing up against systemic issues, even in confrontations with ICE agents. Her deep-rooted commitment to her community reflects her understanding of its struggles and aspirations. In these challenging times, we need Bushra in Congress to effectively represent our voices and interests.”

NIAMA (Northern Illinois American Muslim Alliance), one of the region’s leading Muslim community organizations, praised Amiwala’s inclusive leadership and tangible results as an elected official.

“Bushra Amiwala is the candidate who best reflects understanding of the full diversity and vibrant tapestry of the 9th Congressional District,” said Vaseem Iftekhar, Chairman and Founder of NIAMA. “Through her extensive social and political work, she has consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of our communities’ needs. We especially applaud her leadership on the Halal and Kosher School Lunch Act, for which she testified in Springfield and spearheaded implementation in her school district as a board member — making it one of the first in the state to adopt the program even before it became law. Bushra has the experience, commitment, and vision to seamlessly transition into the role of an outstanding Congresswoman.”

These announcements follow Amiwala’s previous wave of endorsements from Northside Democracy for America, the Cook County Latino Democrats, and more than a dozen local elected officials and community leaders, including former Congresswoman Marie Newman (IL-03) and former congressional candidate Miracle Jenkins (IL-09). Those endorsements, announced last week, featured school board members, park and library trustees, and municipal officials from across the district.

Amiwala’s campaign continues to highlight her ability to bring together people of different backgrounds and perspectives to address shared priorities — from affordability and education to healthcare access and immigrant rights.

“What unites this coalition is a belief that good government begins with empathy and accountability,” Amiwala said. “We’re building a campaign that reflects the full diversity of our district — and the momentum continues to grow. I am so grateful for the support and will continue working tirelessly to represent every corner of our district.”

Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy.","Sustainable travel options for colleagues are not only good for the environment, they make good business sense too, writes Patrizia Niehaus.

As the leaves fall and the crisp morning air brushes against our cheeks, there is no mistaking it: October is here. By this stage, the schools are back in action, colleges and universities are open, and those long-awaited summer holidays are well and truly behind us.

If you listen carefully, you can almost hear the collective groan of commuters across the country, stranded in bumper-to-bumper traffic, gritting their teeth and glancing at their watches as precious minutes slip away. Rush hour has returned and with it comes more congestion, more frustration and more emissions.

“Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy”

In fact, the daily commute is one of the biggest contributors to traffic congestion. With over 3 million cars on our roads, and 59% of people driving to work every day, it’s no wonder the Environmental Protection Agency found that transport emissions represent the greatest overall increase in GHG emissions of any sector – rising by 129% in the last 30 years.

The reality is everybody has a role to play in reducing Ireland’s emissions and often, it’s the small steps that can lead to meaningful change. However, when considering the commute, it could be argued that businesses have a bigger influence, or more accurately a bigger opportunity, to make a real impact. After all, what is one of the main reasons the daily commute exists? People have to get to work.

The toll of travel

This realisation has not gone unnoticed with companies across the globe now facing increased pressure to disclose their ESG data. And while reporting platforms are incredibly helpful in streamlining data and ensuring compliance, they cannot create metrics out of thin air.

Businesses have a responsibility to measure and manage their emissions, including those caused by the daily commute of their employees. These emissions fall under the notoriously difficult to track and address, scope three category.

As well as higher levels of pollution, according to our own research here at KINTO Join, commuting can also have a negative impact on people’s mental health.

In fact, 45% of Irish people find their daily commute stressful. It comes as no surprise that the top frustration among commuters in Ireland is traffic congestion. In turn, those travelling by car could find a once 20-minute journey taking over an hour and a once half-empty carpark jammed with queues.

Without question, the daily commute inflicts some form of misery on employees’ lives – whether it be environmentally, physically or mentally.

Unfortunately, for many, there is no other choice than to jump in the car to get to where they need to go. However, companies do have a choice when it comes to enabling sustainable commuting for employees.

Go on green!

So, what happens if businesses decide to shift gears and embrace sustainable commuting options? Much like the challenges of commuting, the advantages are endless.

By incentivising public transport, implementing low-cost shuttle options and/or utilising carpooling apps, businesses have the ability to help reduce emissions – in some cases, saving hundreds of kilogrammes of CO2. They also have the power to enhance the commuting experience for employees.

This not only benefits people and the environment, but also the business. In general, happier staff are more productive. In turn, there is likely to be less turnover and higher retention. In fact, almost two-thirds of commuters we surveyed acknowledged they are more likely to stay in a job with more favourable commuting options.

These are all additional benefits that don’t even consider the core advantage – playing a part in reducing transport emissions, helping Ireland to meet its mandated EU climate targets and ultimately protecting our planet against climate change for generations to come.

Without doubt, it is within a business’ best interest to incorporate sustainable commuting options into their ESG strategy. It is no longer simply an environmental choice; it’s a strategic investment in both the wellbeing of a company’s workforce and the future of the organisation.",https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/app/uploads/2025/10/sustainable-travel.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:36.880335

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure.
""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters.
""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.
The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress.","The Solar for All program, launched on Earth Day in 2024, was set to bring cleaner, more affordable energy to nearly a million low-income and disadvantaged households. But its promise was cut short when the $7 billion grant initiative was canceled following the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. Now, close to two dozen states are suing the Trump administration, according to Reuters.

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure. This comes after Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced the termination of Solar for All in August, shortly after the funds were briefly unfrozen.

The initiative had been funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the previous administration, and it was intended to enable the installation of solar panels in communities across the country. But the project was designed to support more than just the clean energy transition away from polluting energy sources — its aims also included more resilient power grids, increased U.S. energy independence, a boost for local economies, and lower household electricity costs.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his state will lose about $250 million in federal funds, according to Reuters, while Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her state's loss of $156 million would cause energy bills for more than 11,000 Arizona families to go up by 20 percent. Mayes also noted that marginalized communities in Northern Arizona, such as the Hopi Tribe, have lost a $25 million award to bring electricity and battery storage to hundreds of homes — some of which have never been connected to the grid.

""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters. ""In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.""

According to a 2024 news release issued under the previous administration, the Solar for All grants were designed to improve equitable access to solar energy in order to advance environmental justice and save more than 900,000 American households $350 million annually. In fact, with tens of thousands of U.S. residents lacking safe and consistent access to electricity at home, the program was set to improve equitable access in general.

Job creation was envisioned as another benefit of Solar for All. Following its termination, the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions advocating for green jobs, released a statement saying the move is an attack on working families. ""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.

The AGs' lawsuits are seeking both monetary damages and reinstatement of the program. The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress. A group of unions, nonprofits, and homeowners has also separately sued the administration for the program termination.

While a legal battle over vast sums may ensue, some states, cities, and homeowners have already been taking matters into their own hands. Some residents have been able to leverage more local funding and make at-home panel installation happen. Others are signing up for community solar programs to save money and reduce their environmental footprints.

Communities are coming together in other ways too. For example, in Maine — which happens to be one of the states involved in the lawsuits — the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy has been hosting monthly ""energy cafés"" so locals can get together to learn about home solar and other cleaner, more affordable energy options.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/white-house-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 21:03:37.600168

The program was announced in 2022 as a part of then-President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which contained significant climate change legislation. Connecticut was granted $62.45 million from EPA in 2024, but in August, $62 million was allegedly liquidated from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s account, according to Tong’s office.

“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program,” Zeldin said. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.”

H.R. 1, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, contained language that would rescind Solar for All funds that were not legally allocated as of July 3, 2025. Tong says, though, that Connecticut should not have felt much of an impact, as the EPA obligated all $7 billion for the program in 2024.

“Congress created the Solar for All program, and EPA awarded these funds so that Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills. Trump cannot unilaterally reverse course now, and we’re suing to make sure Connecticut gets every penny we are owed,” Tong said in a press release.

Another billionaire has entered the electric vehicle market. Jeff Bezos is funding a startup called Slate Auto, which plans to launch a “radically affordable” EV pickup truck — priced at around $25,000 — as early as next year, according to TechCrunch.

The company will offer just one model — a compact, two-door electric truck. But with its low price and modular design, Slate could appeal to budget-conscious drivers looking for a no-frills alternative to high-end EVs.

So how does Bezos’ truck compare to Elon Musk’s Tesla Cybertruck?

Price Comparison: Slate vs. Cybertruck

According to the Slate Auto website, its signature truck is expected to be priced around $25,000.

The Tesla Cybertruck, on the other hand, starts at $72,490 for the all-wheel drive model and $114,990 for the Cyberbeast model.

That’s a difference of nearly $50,000 to $90,000, depending on the Cybertruck model, making the Slate the far more affordable choice.

Features and Range: Minimalism vs. Luxury

While the Cybertruck is packed with futuristic high-end features, Slate takes a minimalist approach to keep costs low.

Slate EV Truck

Range: 150 miles (standard), up to 240 miles with extended battery

Customization: Can be converted into a five-seat SUV, open-air vehicle or cargo truck

Interior: No infotainment system, no Bluetooth

Add-ons: Power window, heated seats, color wraps and more are available for extra cost

Tesla Cybertruck

Range: 320 to 325 miles, depending on model

Interior: Dual touchscreens, ambient lighting, 15 premium speakers

Tech: Advanced autopilot features

Who Is the Slate Truck For?

With its ultra-low price and basic build, Slate is targeting a niche audience — those who care about function over flair and affordability over luxury.

“There’s nothing wrong with trying to crack the affordability crisis, but I don’t see this as a massive volume seller,” Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told The New York Times. “Ultimately, this is an extremely small EV with almost nothing in it, in a market with a growing number of affordable choices with much longer range.”

There likely won’t be much overlap between customers who would buy a Slate and those who would buy a Cybertruck.

From deadly floods that claimed dozens of lives to mounting U.S. pressure on Mexican politicians, the period between October 13 and 17 highlighted the complex issues confronting President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration. Meanwhile, business milestones, a controversial legal reform, cultural celebrations and environmental initiatives offered a window into the country’s progress and resilience.

Didn’t have time to read every story this week? Here’s what you missed.

Natural disasters devastate Mexican communities

This week marked the first stage of recovery after catastrophic flooding ravaged five central and eastern states. By week’s end, the death toll had climbed to 72 people with 48 officially declared missing, while 127 towns remained virtually inaccessible. Veracruz bore the brunt with 32 deaths, followed by Hidalgo with 21 and Puebla with 18.

The government unveiled a tracking website showing 12,350 emergency responders deployed with 30 helicopters and 681 heavy machinery units. At Friday’s press conference, Sheinbaum praised the “heroism” of approximately 52,000 federal and state workers responding to the crisis. However, she faced criticism from angry residents during a visit to Poza Rica in Veracruz, where fetid water remained ankle-deep and concerns about typhoid and cholera spread. Veracruz Governor Rocío Nahle drew particular criticism after reports emerged that she had canceled the state’s natural disaster insurance policy.

Puerto Vallarta experienced its own crisis when a nine-hour storm flooded more than 1,000 homes, claiming one life. The city also mourned the sinking of the Marigalante pirate ship following a bilge pump failure.

Business and economic developments

Mexico achieved a significant milestone, becoming the leading exporter of electric vehicles to the United States, exporting approximately 145,000 EVs last year and surpassing Japan and South Korea. Production through September 2025 reached 214,203 units, a 39.3% increase year-over-year.

Mexico is now the leading exporter of electric vehicles to the US, surpassing Japan and South Korea

Chinese investment continued as Shanghai-based Yongmaotai announced a $63 million auto parts plant in Coahuila. Mexico’s first green hydrogen plant opened in Querétaro, a partnership between German company Gerresheimer and Mexican company Cryoinfra requiring 100 million pesos ($5.3 million) in investment. The plant will produce 500 cubic meters of green hydrogen daily, reducing CO₂ emissions by 100 tons annually.

Mexico’s Energy Ministry forecasts that 96% of private-sector energy investment will go toward renewables between 2025 and 2030.

Tourism faced challenges as Tulum’s hotel occupancy dropped sharply, falling 17.5 percentage points in September to 49.2%, a drop attributed to high prices and increasing amounts of sargassum seaweed washing ashore on local beaches.

Cartel violence costs lives and stifles growth

Violence and organized crime remained pressing concerns. Authorities confirmed the discovery of 60 bodies at a clandestine burial site near Hermosillo, Sonora, with the Sonora Peace Seekers collective uncovering the remains between January and February. Five suspects have been arrested.

A drone attack targeted a Mexican government office in Tijuana on Wednesday night, with cartels deploying three drones carrying improvised explosive devices filled with nails and metal pieces. The attack damaged cars at the state attorney general’s anti-kidnapping unit but caused no casualties. The U.S. Consulate issued a security alert following the incident.

In Mexico City, prominent lawyer David Cohen Sacal was shot dead outside a courthouse on October 14, attacked at point-blank range by an 18-year-old assailant.

Sinaloa foreign direct investment plummets amid cartel turf war

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security raised alarms about Mexican cartels supposedly offering bounties of up to $50,000 for attacks on U.S. federal agents. At Wednesday’s press conference, Sheinbaum said the U.S. hadn’t provided Mexico with any evidence related to the alleged bounty program.

Violence in Sinaloa took its economic toll as foreign direct investment plummeted 87% during the first six months of 2025, shrinking from $262.8 million to $34.3 million.

Mexico-US diplomatic tensions

Relations between the two nations showed strain when Reuters reported that more than 50 Morena-affiliated politicians have had their U.S. visas revoked, with the total potentially exceeding 70. Former U.S. ambassadors suggested the Trump administration is using this tool more aggressively on drug trafficking and corruption issues.

New laws and institutional changes

Congress approved a major reform to the Amparo Law, with supporters claiming it will release over 2 billion pesos ($108 million) in tax credits. At Thursday’s press conference, Sheinbaum dismissed Fitch Ratings’ concerns that the reform could dampen investment.

The Chamber of Deputies raised fees on tourist and residency visas, with some residency permits more than doubling in cost. A one-year temporary residency visa will rise from 5,328 pesos ($290) to 11,140 pesos ($606), while permanent residency will climb from 6,494 pesos ($353) to 13,578 pesos ($738). The legislation also doubles admission fees to priority museums and archaeological sites and raises taxes on soft drinks, electrolyte beverages, tobacco and casino gambling.

In a cybersecurity revelation, U.S. researchers found that much Mexican satellite data is unencrypted. Computer scientists intercepted unencrypted communications from Mexican government agencies, the military, and companies using $600 worth of equipment. At Friday’s press conference, Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla insisted all military communications are encrypted and denied evidence of data interception.

The Bank of Mexico also began withdrawing the blue 20-peso bill featuring President Benito Juárez after nearly 20 years in circulation.

Nuevo León Governor Samuel García inaugurated the first phase of the $1.2 billion Interserrana Highway, which will reduce travel times from southern Nuevo León to Monterrey from five hours to three.

Cultural highlights

Even as the country struggled with natural disasters and security problems, Mexico’s cultural scene flourished both at home and abroad. Stars gathered at the 23rd Morelia International Film Festival, featuring Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho, French actress Juliette Binoche, and Oscar-winning writer Charlie Kaufman.

Former Mexico City street sweeper Macario Martínez performed on NPR’s “Tiny Desk Concert,” eight months after his viral sensation “Sueña Lindo, Corazón” captivated social media.

Mexican cyclist Isaac del Toro claimed victory at the Giro del Veneto, his 16th title of 2025. The 21-year-old now ranks third in UCI world rankings.

Finally, archaeologists announced the discovery of a rare 1,400-year-old scorpion-shaped mound in Puebla’s Tehuacán Valley, described as “unprecedented” in Mesoamerica and possibly used as an astronomical observatory.

Wild Mexico

Mexico’s unparalleled natural biodiversity was on display as three iconic species made headlines this week. Gulf of California whales are suing for their right to a livable habitat, a potentially groundbreaking lawsuit allowing non-human plaintiffs (the charges were filed on behalf of the whales by the NGO Nuestro Futuro). Monarch butterflies began their annual migration to Mexico, expected to reach Michoacán and México state by early November.

And in Oaxaca, a jaguar cub named Yazu was born at the Yagul Jaguar Sanctuary, the first birth produced via the Jaguar Genetic Bank project, offering hope for the threatened species.

Looking ahead

Mexico faces a critical juncture as it navigates intersecting crises: The flooding disasters exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities requiring sustained investment. Sheinbaum’s government must balance disaster response with security challenges and increasingly complex U.S. relations. Meanwhile, critics say recent legal reforms could undermine average citizens’ access to justice. Yet amid these difficulties, Mexico’s surging EV exports, renewable energy leadership, cultural achievements and environmental conservation efforts demonstrate resilience and adaptability that may prove crucial for navigating the uncertain times ahead.

Key skills needed in the region include trades such as electricians, bricklayers and plumbers as well as engineers and metal workers, with the largest clean energy employer expected to be in carbon capture as well as offshore wind, the UK Government said.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has also set out the role the UK Government wants to see trade unions play in clean energy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from more than 70% in the mid 1990s to around 30% today.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

In January it was announced that Pembrokeshire had been identified as a ‘key growth region for clean energy’ and was set to receive around £1 million in skills funding.

The skills regional funding comes from the UK Government’s Office for Clean Energy Skills Fund and will be awarded for skills mapping to the Welsh Government. It will be responsible for developing a plan for how best to target the money.

The UK Government said funding could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers, supporting people into opportunities in industries such as welding, electrical engineering, and construction.

Welsh Government Minister for Skills, Jack Sargeant, said:

“Our ambition is to ensure today’s young people will have the skills needed to work the jobs of tomorrow, helping us embed the industries and services of the future in our communities.

“With decades of industrial expertise Wales is primed to capitalise on the generational opportunity that is the UK’s clean energy revolution. The plan announced today will complement our Net Zero Skills Action Plan and support our journey to a cleaner, more prosperous Wales.”

The UK Government said new skills initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – Five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Pembrokeshire, Cheshire and Lincolnshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans – Working with Mission Renewable, the UK Government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations.

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades.

Upskill existing workers – Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid.

Russell Greenslade, Director of CBI Wales, said:

“The growth of Wales’ clean energy economy is opening up real opportunities for people and communities right across the nation. The launch of the Clean Energy Jobs Plan provides a practical, forward-looking framework to connect local talent with both the opportunities emerging in this fast-developing sector and with the businesses driving delivery on the ground.

“Wales is already showing how workers, particularly those from traditional industries, can successfully transition into clean energy roles, drawing on our established strengths and deep industrial heritage. If we want people to feel genuinely invested in this transition and empowered to play their part, we must clearly show them where they fit in and how their skills and experience can contribute to Wales’ cleaner, stronger economic future.”

Zac Richardson, Group Chief Engineer at National Grid, said:

“Secure, affordable and clean energy is essential to unlocking UK economic growth and productivity – ambitions which are underpinned by electricity networks and the unprecedented levels of planned investment in them.

“We welcome the UK Government’s focus on skills and training – especially for technical roles vital to our energy future – and look forward to working together to build a diverse, homegrown workforce that can deliver the grid of tomorrow.”

The plan also includes proposals such as:

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights.

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and the newly formed Great British Energy.

With at least one in six ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the UK Government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations. The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 55,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.",https://businessnewswales.com/wp-content/uploads/Solar-Panels-Local-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 20:04:15.044436

A current loophole gives protections like the minimum wage to oil and gas workers in UK territorial seas, but not to workers in the clean energy sector.","Ministers have unveiled their flagship plan to train and recruit workers for the booming clean energy sector, which it is hoping to supercharge in the next five years.

Up to £18m of new money has been pledged by the UK and Scottish governments specifically to move those working in the oil and gas sector into new roles.

Their jobs are about to fall off a cliff as the industry declines, with at least 40,000 of the current 115,000 jobs forecast to disappear by the early 2030s.

Almost all of those roles are thought to be fairly easily transferable into green industries - requiring little more than a few months of extra training.

But in the absence of government help, workers have been moving abroad, industry says, taking with them the expertise Britain badly needs to for its new greener energy system.

And it has left them feeling forgotten about after years of working to keep the lights on, and increasingly swayed by Reform UK, both GMB and Unite unions have warned Labour.

Pledge to double green jobs by 2030

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News that creating jobs in sectors like carbon capture and storage and hydrogen would help ""create a future for those in the North Sea communities"".

The new £18m will pay for careers advice, training, and ""skills passports"" to enable oil and gas workers to make the switch without having to repeat qualifications.

The cash was announced on Sunday in the new Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which details how the government hopes to make good on its promise to double green jobs by 2030.

Mr Miliband said in an interview: ""This plan shows 400,000 extra jobs in the clean energy economy by 2030.

""This isn't a target. This is actually what we believe is necessary to meet all the plans we have across the economy.""

The first strategy of its kind hopes to plug the UK's massive skills gap that threatens to derail the government's target to green the electricity system by 2030.

It identifies 31 priority occupations that are particularly in demand, such as plumbers, electricians and welders, and lists a target to convert five colleges into new ""Technical Excellence Colleges"" to train workers.

'You can't train people for jobs that aren't there'

Unions welcomed the plan, but pointed out that skills and training do not equate to new jobs.

They say it will mean nothing without extra money and a revitalised domestic supply chain to build all the green technology needed, from fibreglass wind turbines to aluminium sub-sea cables.

Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary who has threatened to cut ties with Labour over its policy to end North Sea oil and gas drilling and watering down of a ban on zero-hours contracts, welcomed the ""initial steps"" but called for ""an equally ambitious programme of public investment"".

Professor Paul de Leeuw from the Energy Transition Institute in Aberdeen said the plan was ""genuinely new and different"", and had for the first time joined up relevant information and strategies in one place.

But ""you can't train people for jobs that aren't there"", he added, also calling for an investment plan.f

Reform heartlands could benefit from Labour's jobs plan

The boom in clean energy jobs stands to benefit Reform heartlands along the east coast of Britain.

That fact is more by luck than design, given the east coast's proximity to offshore wind farms and carbon capture and storage fields in the North Sea.

Reform promises a radically different vision for the country's future, based on reopening coal mines and maxing out nuclear power and what's left of North Sea oil and gas to boost jobs and the economy.

Its deputy leader, Richard Tice, objects to land being used for solar panels and pylons.

Government modelling forecasts an additional 35,000 direct jobs in Scotland, 55,000 in the East of England and 50,000 in the North West.

To keep the unions sweet, the government will also have to follow through on its pledge to boost the rights of those working offshore in green energy.

The letter from the group of senators argues that the program would have reduced electricity bills by 20% for 900,000 households nationwide.

It says the termination is “unlawful” and the funding was “appropriated and fully obligated.”

Arizona delegation sent previous letter to EPA administrator Zeldin

A separate letter was signed by an Arizona delegation including Gallego, Kelly, Rep. Greg Stanton, Rep. Asmin Ansari and Governor Katie Hobbs on Aug. 14.

“Arizona is a prime spot for energy investments that will create good-paying jobs and lower the cost of utility bills,” said Sen. Kelly said in a release from the previous letter. “With so many of these project coming to the state, cutting funding to solar grants will hurt Arizona families.”

Stats regarding Solar for All program

The Solar for All program was introduced in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, intended to make the renewable energy accessible to nearly 1 million Americans.

The $7 billion program was terminated on Aug. 7, Zeldin announced.

However, the termination of some of the grant funding began in March 2025.

A release from the EPA in 2024 said the program had already chosen 60 selectees to receive grant awards and provide solar to low-income households.

“Arizona families are already struggling with rising energy costs, and the Trump administration just made things worse by canceling $156 million in funding meant to help lower energy bills and create good-paying jobs across Arizona,” said Sen. Gallego.

Automakers and governments are grappling with economic realities, including sluggish consumer demand, high production costs, and supply-chain disruptions, leading to revised targets and delayed mandates.

In the U.S., the retreat has been stark. General Motors recently announced a $1.6 billion charge related to declining EV sales, attributing the downturn to policy shifts and market conditions. This comes amid broader industry adjustments, where even pioneers like Tesla have scaled back expansion plans amid softening demand.

Policy Shifts in North America and Europe Signal a Broader Reassessment of EV Goals

Canada, under Prime Minister Mark Carney, has paused its electric-vehicle sales mandate originally slated for next year, citing the need for a more pragmatic timeline to avoid economic strain on consumers and manufacturers. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration has introduced flexibility into the nation’s EV targets, allowing for phased implementation rather than rigid deadlines.

The European Union, long a leader in aggressive climate policies, bowed to pressure from automakers last month by initiating an early review of its 2035 goal to eliminate carbon-dioxide emissions from new cars. This move, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, reflects growing concerns over job losses in the automotive sector and the feasibility of rapid electrification without sufficient infrastructure.

Economic Pressures and Market Realities Are Forcing Even Ambitious Nations to Recalibrate

Even China, the world’s largest EV market, is showing signs of strain. While still dominating global production, Beijing has begun to temper subsidies and incentives, leading to a slowdown in sales growth. According to insights from LiveMint, economic concerns such as overcapacity and international trade tensions are prompting this caution, with exports facing tariffs in key markets like the U.S. and EU.

This synchronized retreat underscores a pivotal moment for the auto industry. High battery costs, inadequate charging networks, and consumer hesitancy—fueled by range anxiety and higher upfront prices—have exposed the limitations of top-down mandates. In the U.S., the Biden administration’s ambitious EV tax credits have not fully offset these barriers, resulting in inventory pileups at dealerships.

Industry Insiders Weigh the Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Supply Chains

For industry executives, this global realignment offers both challenges and opportunities. Companies like Ford and Volkswagen are pivoting toward hybrid models as a bridge technology, investing in flexible manufacturing lines that can adapt to shifting demand. Analysts note that while pure EV adoption slows, advancements in battery technology and renewable energy integration could accelerate once economic conditions improve.

Yet, the retreat raises questions about meeting Paris Agreement climate goals. As Political Wire highlights, without sustained policy support, the transition risks stalling, potentially ceding technological leadership to regions that maintain momentum. In the EU, for instance, automakers are lobbying for extended deadlines to preserve competitiveness against Chinese rivals.

Andy Beshear has joined elected Democrats from other states in suing the Trump administration to stop what they call the “unlawful termination” of billions of dollars for residential solar projects.

A press release Wednesday from California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the cancellation of the $7 billion “Solar for All” program denied states “critical funds they were depending on for solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities nationwide.”

Bonta is among more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, along with Beshear and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleging the program’s termination is illegal and unconstitutional.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated the program in August, Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement on social media said the agency’s authority to administer the program was eliminated through the passage of a tax-and-spending law signed by Trump this summer. The Associated Press reported Zeldin characterized the program as a “boondoggle.”

An email received Thursday from the EPA’s press office stated the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Congress created the “Solar for All” program through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the program aimed to expand residential solar energy projects to hundreds of thousands of low-income households across the country.

Kentucky officials planned to use a portion of $62 million from the program to install residential solar panels paired with battery storage systems on homes in “disaster-impacted communities.” A group of stakeholders had met several times this year in planning how the state would use the funding in communities affected by floods and tornadoes.

Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in an early September email to the Lantern said the state couldn’t access its “Solar for All” funding because it was being “unlawfully withheld by the federal administration.”

“Team Kentucky is working hard to ensure the federal government makes good on its promise to our people and delivers the entirety of this funding,” Hartman wrote in her email.",https://i0.wp.com/linknky.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1809-1536x1024-1.jpg?fit=1536%2C1024&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-18 23:04:56.538287

It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.
But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.
“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson.
Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.","SCOTTSVILLE, Va.—In rural Fluvanna County about an hour west of the state capital, a proposed natural gas power plant offers a window into a multi-state effort to speed more electricity sources onto the grid.

All but a handful of the projects in the initiative by PJM Interconnection, which runs the regional grid, would belch carbon pollution. Tenaska Energy’s proposal is among those dubbed by PJM as “shovel-ready, high-reliability” generation projects that would get a faster path through the clogged queue to connect to a grid increasingly stressed by power-hungry data centers.

But power plants need local approval, too. Tenaska’s proposal, which has some support, also faces concerns from residents about health effects, noise and transparency.

Last week the Fluvanna County Planning Commission deferred until November any decision on whether the 1.5-gigawatt plant is in “substantial accord” with the county’s comprehensive plan, a crucial step needed along with a special-use permit that will be voted on in January.

“I think we’d like to rely on science and independent judgment before we’re asked to take what is a very critical step for this community and its long-term future,” said commission member Kathleen Kilpatrick.

The company wants to build the project next to a gas plant it already operates in the county, the Tenaska Virginia Generating Station. Amber Kidd, a Fluvanna resident, told Inside Climate News that she supports the Nebraska-based developer’s proposal, given that her family has worked at the existing plant without any safety issues.

“We are a fossil-fuel family,” said Kidd. “I’m very proud of where we work and want to see this come. Rural areas that continue to refuse growth, they die off. … I support the jobs.”

In a county of about 30,000 people that President Donald Trump won by about six points, his staunch support for fossil fuels is far from universally shared by its residents. Lauren Banning, at the planning commission meeting last week, said she is concerned about toxic emissions more than a “negligible tax break, a few jobs, not even 50.”

“My kids love playing outside all day long, but if I’m scared of the air not being breathable, how is this helping our county and our community?” Banning said.

The Proposal

The proposed $2.2 billion plant, called the Expedition Generating Station, is expected to come online in 2031 after obtaining local, state and federal permits. It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.

Timberly Ross, a spokesperson for the company, told Inside Climate News that the planning commission vote deferral “pushes us back a few months, but we remain committed to bringing this much-needed development to Fluvanna County.”

Tenaska said the new plant could power up to 1.5 million homes. It’s part of PJM’s Reliability Resource Initiative, called RRI for short. PJM, which oversees a competitive market for wholesale electricity in all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, is inserting RRI projects into its backlogged queue of interconnection requests.

Most of the non-RRI projects waiting to connect to the grid are renewables.

PJM created the initiative to ensure ample electric generating capacity and avoid shortages resulting from data centers’ surging demands. But clean energy supporters have decried that projects that are mostly fueled by natural gas will leapfrog renewables that have long waited their turn to start cranking out electricity.

Virginia’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, is planning for several gas plants alongside a number of renewable energy projects of its own to meet demand. Tenaska is an independent power producer that would sell electricity from Expedition either directly into the regional grid or to Dominion through a power purchase agreement.

Since the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s goal to decarbonize the electric grid by 2050 applies to only Dominion and utility Appalachian Power, Tenaska is not bound by requirements to prove the need for the plant or retire it within the next 25 years.

“This location is attractive due to access to existing transmission corridors, water supply and natural gas pipelines,” the company said in a presentation before the planning commission.

Tenaska also builds renewables projects. But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.

“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson. But in Fluvanna, given local hostility to renewables, Ross said the gas plant “is the appropriate technology for this location.”

Questions About Air Pollution, Noise

Tenaska hasn’t yet disclosed expected pollution levels from the new plant. Nor has it shared in planning meetings what its current plant’s emissions have been.

Instead, at the planning commission meeting, Tenaska representatives noted what the company had anticipated its existing plant’s emissions of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and two types of fine particle pollution would be, estimated years before the project was built. They said it showed rates “less than 15 percent of the applicable standard.”

All of those pollutants can cause serious health problems, particularly involving the lungs.

Josephus Allmond, a resident of Fluvanna and an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, shared information on cancer rates at a meeting in October held by Chris Fairchild, the Board of Supervisors’ chairman. Allmond cited a 2012 report by the regional health district showing that lung cancer incidents in Fluvanna County between 2004 to 2008, the period just after Tenaska built its first plant, increased more than 30 percent compared with 1999 to 2003.

“My question for the folks at Tenaska: That was for a plant slightly under 1,000 megawatts—can we expect an even bigger increase in incidents of lung cancer if this plant is approved?” said Allmond.

Residents asked the company at that meeting why it wasn’t sharing actual pollution figures from its operating plants around the country. Tenaska officials said they would share more emissions data later, through the state’s pollution permitting process.

The company on its website also states that “claims regarding the plant and local cancer cases are ridiculous and defamatory.” Federal air standards protect against health impacts, including cancer, the company contends, and it says the new plant will be categorized as a “minor source of hazardous air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.

Another worry raised by residents at that meeting was noise. Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.

“I have the same concerns,” Fairchild told the residents. “But we don’t deal with a $2 billion item every day. There are a lot of concerns that haven’t been addressed.”

The company’s spokesperson told Inside Climate News that the current plant is a net positive for the area.

“Tenaska has operated in Fluvanna County for more than 20 years, consistently meeting stringent air quality standards, operating under the county-mandated sound levels and providing roughly $35 million in tax revenue to the county,” Ross said. “Our application … not only provided those facts but also included robust supplemental materials, including an independent sound study, economic impact study, traffic plan and visual renderings.”

Laurie Partner, a local real estate agent whose husband works at the plant, said to the planning commission that the smoke coming from the stacks was “steam,” and cancer can come from other sources like smoking and microwaving plastics.

“It was almost sickening to me to hear all the misinformation that was stated there,” Partner said in an interview with Inside Climate News.

Sharon Harris, a Fluvanna resident, said she sees a lot of misinformation floating around the county about a main alternative to new gas plants: solar. As a founding member of the Fluvanna Horizons Alliance, which opposes Tenaska’s project, she wants to raise awareness of who needs the power—data centers, not local residents—and a better understanding of how solar works.

Local resentment toward clean energy has grown through hours-long county meetings discussing potential harms to farmland from solar, stormwater runoff concerns and a presentation from the Citizen Defenders of Fluvanna County on what to do with solar panels after they’ve reached the end of their life. Some residents still see it as an expensive form of energy, even though financial advisory firm Lazard’s widely cited research on electricity costs shows solar is now the cheapest option.

“There’s definitely a lack of knowledge and information in our community,” said Harris.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251007_205441.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 17:07:27.815593

Amid uncertain water consumption further exacerbating infrastructure, drought, and aquifer concerns and high electricity demands, data center construction continues to proliferate throughout Texas.","(Texas Scorecard) – With electricity prices climbing nationwide and state regulators warning of “lower system stability,” Texas is confronted with the high costs of serving data centers while protecting local communities and resources.

Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) spokesperson Trudi Webster told Texas Scorecard that the Public Utility Commission of Texas has started rule-making “with the purpose of implementing the SB6 performance requirements for data centers’ and other large loads’ response during emergencies.”

Signed into law in 2023, Senate Bill 6, Webster explained, “creates performance requirements for new large loads during emergency conditions.”

Large loads are high electricity demand consumers, such as the newly operational Stargate data center campus in Abilene and bitcoin mining operations like the one in Rockdale, Texas.

While Texas’ regulators are imposing stricter performance standards, concerns remain over how the state can sustain these energy-hungry projects.

Stargate I campus in Abilene will have a 1.2 gigawatt (GW) power capacity, which equates to roughly 1,200 megawatts (MW), when fully completed in 2026. If the facility ran at maximum capacity when fully completed, the campus would consume 10,512,000 MWh (megawatt hours) per year. That’s enough energy to power over 1 million homes in 2025.

Data centers in Texas are forecasted by ERCOT to have a total demand of 77,965 MW in 2030. This is an increased projection from 2024, which projected a load of only 29,614 MW.

The World Economic Forum reported it is “impossible to accommodate the growth in AI data centres and maintain grid stability without prices increasing for all customers” in deregulated electricity markets like Texas.

Enverus, a publisher of energy-sector research, released a report revealing that ERCOT has “added 22.5 GW of new capacity since January 2024 … and is planning for nearly 100 GW of solar and battery additions by 2030.”

This is roughly 22,500 MW of capacity added since the beginning of last year, with planned additions of roughly 100,000 MW by 2030.

The Texas Energy Fund—overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas—provides grants and loans to finance the construction, maintenance, modernization, and operation of electric facilities in Texas.

According to the Enverus report, the Texas Energy Fund’s active due diligence process has seen four project withdrawals in March, two denials in April, four new projects advanced in April and May, and its first two loans awarded this summer.

While the electricity infrastructure projects appear to be slowing down and energy demands continue to increase, another issue exists in addition to rising utility bills.

Electricity consumption and water usage go hand-in-hand.

As previously reported, the Texas Water Development Board has explained that one of the reasons why Texas does not know how much water is actually being consumed by data centers in the state is because of “the variety of power sources that require varying amounts of water.” Additionally, there is “no state government authority that maintains a comprehensive list of data centers in the state.”

The indirect water consumption by data centers in 2023 has been estimated by researchers to be 4.52 liters per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with the average American water intensity factor for electricity usage of 4.35 liters per kWh.

Amid uncertain water consumption further exacerbating infrastructure, drought, and aquifer concerns and high electricity demands, data center construction continues to proliferate throughout Texas.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pylon-high-voltage-tower-sky-background-Image-by-wing-wingShutterstock.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 17:11:38.627539

The Italian-American automaker, which owns Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Chrysler brands, will create more than 5,000 jobs while increasing domestic production capacity by 50 percent across facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

CEO Antonio Filosa framed the massive commitment as foundational to the company’s turnaround strategy under his leadership. Since taking the helm in June, Filosa has prioritized strengthening Stellantis’ position in the United States, its most critical market. The investment represents a signal of confidence in American manufacturing despite significant tariff pressures facing the industry.

The plan encompasses five entirely new vehicles and 19 product refreshes planned through 2029. Rather than focusing heavily on electric vehicles, Stellantis is balancing its product portfolio to include combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, and range-extended electric models alongside traditional powertrains. This marks a strategic shift from previous aggressive electrification timelines.

Illinois will see the reopening of Stellantis’ Belvidere Assembly Plant with more than $600 million in investment. The facility, shuttered in recent years, will produce Jeep Cherokee and Compass models starting in 2027, creating approximately 3,300 jobs. Ohio’s Toledo Assembly Complex will receive nearly $400 million to build a new midsize truck beginning in 2028, adding over 900 positions.

Michigan will host two significant initiatives. The Warren Truck Assembly Plant will invest nearly $100 million to produce a new range-extended electric vehicle combined with a gasoline-powered large SUV starting in 2028, adding more than 900 jobs. Additionally, the Detroit Assembly Complex will receive $130 million to begin producing the next-generation Dodge Durango in 2029.

Indiana will continue engine manufacturing with more than $100 million invested in Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine beginning in 2026, supporting over 100 new positions. The engine represents Stellantis’ commitment to maintaining manufacturing of strategic powertrains domestically.

The automaker emphasized that these investments include research and development costs, supplier expenditures necessary to execute its full product strategy, and manufacturing facility improvements. State and local government approvals remain required before funds are deployed, though the company expressed confidence in negotiations.

Analysts noted the investment arrives amid significant tariff pressures on imported vehicles and components. Stellantis has projected tariffs will cost the company approximately $1.7 billion this year. By consolidating American production, the company potentially reduces exposure to these costs while gaining access to government incentives and consumer preferences for domestically manufactured vehicles.

The announcement represents part of broader industry reshoring efforts. General Motors and Ford have announced comparable investments, with GM recently moving production from Mexico to three American plants and Ford investing $2 billion in Kentucky for electric vehicle production.

Stellantis supports approximately 48,000 American employees across 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers and research sites spanning 14 states. The company operates 2,600 dealerships and works with roughly 2,300 suppliers throughout thousands of American communities.

“Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back to where they were. The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves.”

— attributed to Black Elk (1863-1950)

The environmental movement lost a champion with the Sept. 16 passing of local activist and preservationist Paul Gallimore. With his life partner, Pat, Paul co-founded the Long Branch Environmental Education Center, protecting 1,435 acres in the Newfound Mountains starting in the 1970s and showcasing permaculture practices.

An Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Project farm, Paul grew organic berries and apples and helped to introduce blight-resistant chestnut trees. He built passive solar structures, microhydro power systems and a trout pond, and created compost to add nutrients to the soil. The center is open to the public and mentors participants in ecological practices, while nourishing their souls in the beauty of nature.

Harmony with nature

Paul had great reverence for the Native Americans who initially occupied this land and quoted Black Elk in his 2007 work, Healing Appalachia: Sustainable Living Through Appropriate Technology, co-authored with Al Fritsch, founder of the Appalachia-Science in the Public Interest, a small nonprofit in Kentucky. That publication details sustainable efforts that can be implemented to live in harmony with nature, including solar, photovoltaics, wind power, food production and preservation, silviculture, water irrigation and conservation, among others.

Paul was a champion for respecting the myriad of life forms that occupy our mountains and worked tirelessly to oppose a state law that permitted the slaughtering of 50-pound black bear cubs. (The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission redefined a bear cub as one weighing 75 pounds or less, thereby protecting smaller cubs from hunting, in 2016.) He revered the songs of birds, the diversity of reptiles and the presence of mammals on his land.

Acting locally

My personal experience with Paul began before I had the opportunity to make Western North Carolina my home. I visited his Buncombe County mountain paradise and was awed by its involvements and Paul’s encyclopedic knowledge of the natural world. I subsequently worked with Paul in the mid-1980s to found Save the Mountains, a citizens group opposing the U.S. Department of Energy’s proposal to site a three-county, high-level nuclear waste dump with an epicenter in Big Sandy Mush. Later serving on the district staff of U.S. Rep. Jamie Clarke, I realized how serious this proposal had been and how instrumental our efforts and those of thousands of local concerned citizens had been in stopping this siting.

My later efforts included working with Paul to encourage the co-composting of the organic fraction of Buncombe County’s landfill with clean sewage sludge from the nearby Metropolitan Sewage District (MSD), resulting in a rich soil amendment. This concept was rejected, and MSD instead built a sludge incinerator at its Woodfin facility.

When decisions were being made regarding the siting of a new landfill, Paul worked closely with residents and the county’s solid waste committee to advocate incorporating the state’s solid waste management priorities to first reduce waste, then reuse, recycle, compost and (last) landfill it. He introduced national and international experts to discuss the advantages of large-scale municipal waste recycling and composting programs as prototypes that could be implemented. These initiatives were not followed, and the county acted only to site another landfill.

As the 40-plus-year warnings of the effects of global climate change become lead disaster stories on the evening news, and our own area has been devastated by the fury of Tropical Storm Helene, I lament that the insight and common sense of individuals like Paul Gallimore have not been heeded. The greatest tribute we can provide his legacy is to pursue “good trouble” in our civic engagements and practice sustainability in our own lives.",https://mountainx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon-1.png,N,,2025-10-18 17:11:44.545073

DHL Express announced the rollout of 45 new all-electric, zero-emission Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans into its U.S. pickup and delivery fleet, signifying the first U.S. expansion of the global partnership, with more than 10,000 eSprinters now integrated into DHL’s fleet.

All vehicles are expected to be delivered by the end of October 2025, and will be deployed across key metropolitan markets, including Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Elizabeth, New Jersey; and Moonachie, New Jersey.

While the new eSprinters promise a 206-mile range, DHL has consistently seen them exceed 240 miles, making them the longest-range battery electric vehicles in DHL’s U.S. fleet to-date. This extended capacity makes them ideally suited for inner city logistics while expanding their potential use in longer delivery routes. The vans also offer significant cargo capacity, enabling efficient last-mile delivery without compromise on payload or operational reliability.

To support the integration of these vehicles, DHL has also installed on-site charging infrastructure at its facilities in these markets, enabling drivers to conveniently recharge the vans between routes. The addition of this infrastructure ensures operational efficiency, maximizes vehicle uptime, and provides the foundation for future fleet electrification as the company scales its use of electric vehicles in the U.S.

“Electrifying our fleet is one of the most visible and impactful ways we are moving toward a more sustainable future,” said Greg Hewitt, CEO of DHL Express U.S. “The Mercedes-Benz eSprinter brings an extended range and proven cargo capabilities that allow us to serve our customers with zero emissions, while also advancing our global goal of more sustainable logistics. These vehicles not only strengthen our operations in major U.S. cities but also set the stage for future electric fleet growth across the Americas.”

“The eSprinter represents the next generation of electric mobility for commercial fleets – combining range, cargo capacity, and reliability in a way that meets the demands of modern logistics,” said Jee-Seop Kim, Managing Director of Mercedes-Benz Vans North America’. “We’re proud to see our partnership with DHL Express expand into the U.S., where the eSprinter’s performance and versatility will support their high-efficiency operations.”

The deployment supports DHL’s global Sustainability Roadmap, which includes a target to electrify 66% of its last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030. This effort includes fleet electrification, the expansion of carbon-neutral facilities, and the increased use of sustainable aviation fuels, among other initiatives.

Today, it serves as a living laboratory for climate science, a place where melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, and changing ecosystems offer a glimpse into the Earth’s future.

Across its vast landscape — spanning 663,300 square miles — Alaska compresses global environmental challenges into one dramatic microcosm. Its mountains, tundra, and coastlines reveal how warming transforms not just local communities, but the entire planet. Scientists from around the world travel there to study these transformations, and their findings are reshaping what we know about climate change.

Here are some of the lessons the world is learning from Alaska, the frontline of a changing planet.

Glaciers are the Planet’s Thermometers

Alaska’s glaciers are among the fastest-melting in the world, losing about 66.7 billion tonnes of ice each year as of 2021. If all of Alaska’s glacier ice were to melt, the resulting meltwater would contribute approximately 46.4 mm to global sea-level rise. Glaciers around the world are vanishing faster than scientists can study them with 40% – 90% projected to disappear by the end of the century if current warming trends continue.

Glaciers act as natural climate records with each layer of compacted snow containing trapped air bubbles that can reveal what Earth’s atmosphere was like in the past. Ice cores, cylindrical samples of ice drilled from ice sheets or glaciers, act much like tree rings because they provide records of past environmental conditions. When scientists drill ice cores, they can track carbon dioxide levels, volcanic activity, and temperature shifts over thousands of years.

In August 2025, the rapid melting of Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier led to the formation of a meltwater lake known locally as Suicide Basin, near Juneau. This ice-dammed basin periodically overflows as meltwater builds up and forces its way beneath the thinning glacier, which is losing roughly 100-150 feet of ice each year. When the pressure becomes too great, the basin drains suddenly, triggering destructive floods downstream. Because the sides of the lake are fragile, this sudden release can sweep up large amounts of sediment, posing a threat to buildings and infrastructure.

Sea ice and glaciers help keep the Earth cool by reflecting sunlight back into space, reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the planet. Without this reflective surface, the exposed water absorbs more heat, warming further and causing more ice to melt — a self-reinforcing cycle. The retreat of glaciers and the flooding of Alaska’s Mendenhall River serve as stark warnings of the global consequences of climate change. As these massive ice formations shrink, they accelerate sea-level rise, threaten the livelihoods and safety of coastal communities, and disrupt ocean circulation patterns that regulate the planet’s climate.

Thawing Permafrost = Unlocks Carbon

An estimated 85% of Alaska’s land is covered by permafrost — frozen ground that stores about twice as much carbon as is currently present in Earth’s entire atmosphere

When permafrost thaws, it releases carbon dioxide and methane, two potent greenhouse gases that intensify global warming. Researchers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks stated that the current thaw rates are accelerating. In just a few decades, previously solid ground has subsided into “thermokarst” landscapes that are uneven, soggy terrain where forests tilt and collapse.

This thawing sets up a self-reinforcing feedback loop: warming causes permafrost to melt, which releases massive stores of greenhouse gases (CO₂ and methane). Those emissions further warm the climate, accelerating permafrost degradation in a cycle known as the permafrost carbon–climate feedback. Given the vast carbon reservoirs locked in Arctic soils, many scientists warn this is one of Earth’s potential tipping points and Alaska’s rapidly changing landscapes provide a clear warning of how close we may be to crossing it.

Adapt or Die

Melting permafrost and the significant loss of reflective snow and ice, which leads to less sunlight being reflected and more heat being absorbed, a phenomenon also known as Arctic Amplification, is driving massive change in the region on many levels.

Alaska’s ecosystems and its people are adapting faster than almost anywhere else in the world. As the Arctic warms 3.5 times the global average, climate change is disrupting animal populations, and entire food webs are reorganizing.

For instance, salmon are now moving into rivers that were previously too cold to support them, altering local ecosystems. Yet even as their range expands, overall salmon populations are declining, which is disrupting Indigenous fishing patterns that have been practiced for centuries. The same warming that shifts salmon habits is also thawing permafrost, destabilizing infrastructure — from homes to pipelines — and forcing towns like Newtok to relocate.

Another example is the changing migration patterns of bowhead whales. As sea ice recedes, these whales are delaying their migrations. Once reliant on the Bering Sea’s winter feeding grounds, many now remain in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas year-round, adapting their diets as the shifting ice affects the availability of krill and zooplankton. What’s happening in Alaska offers a glimpse of the environmental, economic, and social transformations that other regions may face in the coming decades.

Alaska’s Lessons

Alaska is no longer just America’s last frontier but the world’s first warning system. Its glaciers, permafrost, and ecosystems are teaching us that climate change isn’t a distant threat but a present reality. The data collected in Alaska informs climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and guides global policy decisions.

As scientists often say: what happens in Alaska doesn’t stay in Alaska. The state’s landscapes, rich in both beauty and evidence, reveal the story of a planet in transition and reminds us that the choices we make now will determine how that story ends.

Our precious living laboratory is under threat now more than ever. Ironically new fossil fuel drilling projects are planned across Alaska — already one of the most climate-vulnerable regions on Earth. These developments risk accelerating environmental damage further in a place that offers critical insights into our planet’s future.

So much for “at the speed of business.” Nonetheless, the governor followed up with a flurry of actions.
In northwestern Pennsylvania, the fruits of permit reform have yet to be realized in the conventional oil and gas industry.
“The Pennsylvania permitting process has not improved at all for conventional oil and gas operators,” says Tyler Martin, environmental care coordinator for Cameron Energy, in Warren County.

Yet, SPEED was not as nimble as its acronym suggested. Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the agency responsible for SPEED, did not start accepting applications until almost one year later.

The DEP website lists eight programs, all intended to improve the state’s process for handling tens of thousands of permit applications annually.

DEP’s “PAyback” program, which promises refunds of application fees if approval deadlines are missed, reported that only two approvals were overdue as of September and that no fees had been refunded since the program’s launch nearly two years ago.

Still, the impact of Pennsylvania’s permitting reform remains selective at best.

“As far as the governor’s ‘get stuff done’ marketing goes, we’ve seen no improvement in the speed of approvals for permit applications or renewals,” says Jim Panaro, executive vice president of Robindale Energy. Robindale recovers and hauls millions of tons of fuel from mine-reclamation sites to its three waste-coal power plants in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Panaro said DEP had apparently taken quicker-than-usual action on an air-quality permit for a new natural gas-fired power plant at Homer City. However, he wondered whether that would have been the case for a less “politically sensitive” project.

In northwestern Pennsylvania, the fruits of permit reform have yet to be realized in the conventional oil and gas industry.

“The Pennsylvania permitting process has not improved at all for conventional oil and gas operators,” says Tyler Martin, environmental care coordinator for Cameron Energy, in Warren County. “Sometimes there are still unnecessary delays.”

For example, the state’s process for identifying potential effects on endangered species has become more difficult, according to reports from both Martin and oil and gas driller Tim Howard from neighboring McKean County. Howard questions why his company needs to go through the process on land it already owns when there is no such requirement for a landowner building a home.

The endangered species regulation led Northampton Fuel Supply, near Wilkes-Barre, to relocate more than 2,000 cubic yards of rock, leftover from previous mining activities, to create bat habitats. “We were fortunate to have the material available,” said Hank Zielinski, Northampton’s vice president.

Regarding permits, Zielinski says DEP appears to do its best to balance conflicting demands. But staffing shortages have contributed to delays in permit renewals. He expects to test the state’s procedures when Northampton files this fall for the first time in seven years an application for a new surface-mine permit.

“My biggest concern is the retirement of experienced professionals at DEP who are familiar with the issues and share our interest in cleaning up waste-coal sites,” he said.

While Pennsylvania’s permitting successes remain limited, some glimmers of hope have been detected by Robindale Energy’s Panaro, who reports a positive “shift in attitude” on the part of federal regulators since the election of President Donald Trump. When DEP takes its lead from the new leadership at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state regulators “have become more reasonable,” says Panaro.

For instance, two Robindale Energy plants had been under pressure to install $600 million in pollution controls based on a questionable claim that their emissions contributed to hazy air on a few days a year in Virginia and New Jersey. Panaro says “the conversation has gone away” in recent months, although regulatory agencies haven’t issued a definitive ruling yet.

Robindale Energy has 20 years’ worth of fuel to fire its plants, limestone feedstock for pollution controls, and disposal space for ash. But the regulatory certainty to assure decades of operation remains heavily dependent on the political will of state and national leaders.

But rather than deal with the ever-changing winds at the federal level, Pennsylvania lawmakers–Shapiro included–must stop paying lip service to “moving at the speed of business” and enact genuine, universal regulatory reform. No more piecemeal approach that selectively picks and chooses winners in the marketplace. No more gimmicky acronyms that don’t produce results.

Instead, Pennsylvania businesses need an efficient and predictable regulatory environment–one that genuinely moves at the speed of business.

I venture down the crunchy hobbit trail. Ornate cobwebs slap my face ruining hours of work by industrious arachnids.

I unfold my chair and carefully remove hitchhiking Spanish Needles stuck in my socks. I wait for her.

The Oracle explains the stakes: higher temperatures disrupt eons of partnerships between the plants and animals who depend on precise cycles of temperature, nutrients and sunlight to stay alive. She reminds me the sources of food I take for granted are no exception.

She informs me the cost of our energy and food will rise at the same time we increase carbon emissions. I mention a story I saw in the Springfield Daily Citizen: Springfield City Utilities will spend $230 million in ratepayer dollars to build a new natural gas electrical generation plant.

Southwest Power Pool requiring carbon-based generation

We’re told the transmission authority we partner with (Southwest Power Pool or SPP) requires new generation to be carbon-based. Tragically, the area SPP governs is the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy: regional, unlimited, inexpensive wind and solar energy.

And so, CU is instead plowing a ton of money (and raising rates) for a facility to burn natural gas at the exact moment the U.S. is expanding natural gas shipments to Europe to replace Russian sources.

The Oracle predicts the cheap domestic price for natural gas will rise accordingly.

She asks me: Does it really matter how much you pay for a razor? The real cost over time is blades. Similarly, a $230 million capital cost is nothing compared to the cost of the pollution caused by the natural gas we will burn to meet the needs of a growing population.

I mention the fastest growing, cheapest and most reliable form of new generation around the world is solar — with wind a close second. These new sources of electricity become “base load” (reliable and predictable) when you couple them with utility scale batteries. CU did announce 36 megawatts of new batteries but for a city utility with a remarkable combination of renewable energy and low rates, their new carbon-emitting generators are a giant step backward. (Editor’s note: In 2024, City Utilities reported 34% of its delivered energy came from renewables, primarily wind. It has pledged to be “net zero carbon” by 2050.)

Let’s hope we never use it

As utility bills spike across the country, the best outcome for Springfield would be this: we bought a $230 million mistake but we will never use it.

The Oracle knows history. She predicts nothing good can come from linking our utility bills and our region’s future to a never-ending war in Europe. “Foolish humans” she murmurs over the sound of spring water bubbling over mossy boulders.

I can see she is busy with the Fall transition: leaves to colorize; turtles to burrow in the mud; wild bees to complete their nests and then perish; fur coats to thicken and seeds to drop and sleep in soil blankets.

“Come again…” she whispers, dropping a coterie of crimson maple leaves on my path to the warming world above.",https://i0.wp.com/sgfcitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/McCartney-Generating-Station-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-18 20:04:54.519392

The 11-year-old firm had been rapidly expanding over the last couple of years alongside growing market interest in lithium, copper and other minerals needed for electric vehicles and other clean-energy uses.

The layoffs include at least 40 people at Benchmark, the three sources said, out of a total workforce of 200 people. Two of the sources said affected departments included sustainability, sales and marketing.

CEO Andrew Miller in an email to Reuters said the firm had undergone a “recent restructuring.” He declined to comment further on Reuters questions regarding the reductions.

“This process is part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen the quality and delivery of Benchmark’s offering, focused around further investment in our technology and AI capabilities,” he said.

One source cited weak pricing for minerals, especially battery metal lithium, as a drag on Benchmark’s business, whose clients include miners, battery makers and politicians.

Lithium prices have plunged since their peak in 2022 due to slower-than-expected adoption of electric cars.

In a research note Benchmark published on its website last week, the company said it expected a sharp decline in U.S. EV sales in the last quarter of the year. It added that other challenges such as high manufacturing costs and rising tariffs are prompting some carmakers to scale back EV production plans into next year.

Privately held Benchmark last year bought EV market research firm Rho Motion, creating a combined company of 250 employees.

In addition to lithium, Benchmark tracks prices and other market data for copper, cobalt, nickel, graphite, rare earths, manganese, fluorspar and phosphate.

The program was extended by the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act in 2016, and when it expired on Sept. 30, it was not renewed. Since Oct. 1, hybrid or electric vehicles are no longer allowed to use the lane without passengers.

Launched in 2006, the program was meant to incentivize more drivers to transition to “environmentally friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles to promote energy independence, lower fuel consumption, and improved air quality.” According to New York State Energy Research and Development Authority numbers, New York has over 300,000 electric vehicles on the road and millions of dollars devoted to supporting the vehicles through more charging stations and update facilities.

Sept. 30 was a big day for the electric vehicle industry, as electric vehicle tax credits, a tax break that offered a credit of up to $7,500, were also discontinued. These federal decisions remove the emphasis of electric vehicles in NY’s automotive market; meanwhile, the state is attempting to promote them. This places the state further from achieving its ambitious goal of having all new passenger cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in NYS be zero emissions by 2035. A gasoline-fueled passenger vehicle that drives 11,500 miles per year emits 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.

With state actions weakened by federal moves, state resources are wasted and less efficient. Electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of total registered vehicles–around 1%. To increase this number and thereby reduce reliance on gasoline, initiatives like the Clean Pass Program and EV tax credits were a perk for customers to spend the extra money on a hybrid or electric vehicle.

Traffic is looking different on the Long Island Expressway, and owners of electric vehicles should be aware of the change to save themselves the $150 that they would lose if caught using the HOV lane.",https://tbrnewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HOV_lane_.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:01:41.631246

Districts across the state will receive 10 propane and 87 electric buses, which will replace older diesel-powered buses in 23 school districts.
A third round investment of the Clean Bus Energy Grant, totaling $35.9 million, paid for the 100 additional buses.
The Environmental Protection Agency provided states with $5 billion over five years to create the Clean School Bus Program.
""Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.""","Thousands of diesel-powered school buses drive down Michigan roads each morning. Soon, that number will dwindle just a little, thanks to a $125 million grant from the Michigan Department of Education (MDE).

Districts across the state will receive 10 propane and 87 electric buses, which will replace older diesel-powered buses in 23 school districts.

The program is a partnership between the MDE, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE). It's received support from environmental advocacy groups like It's Electric! and Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation (MAPT).

A third round investment of the Clean Bus Energy Grant, totaling $35.9 million, paid for the 100 additional buses.

The Environmental Protection Agency provided states with $5 billion over five years to create the Clean School Bus Program. Michigan's program was ""created after that to kind of help fill the gaps that we felt the federal program was missing,"" Kindra Weid, the Coalition Coordinator of It's Electric, said.

Public schools could apply for the grant. A primary goal of increasing the number of cleaner-powered buses was to reduce diesel emissions, which are a detriment to air quality. EGLE found which areas of the state were most polluted through mapping tool MI EJScreen, Troy Hansbarger, MDE's Manager of Office of Health Safety, said.

""Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.""

Asthma is a leading cause of absenteeism, according to the state health department. Each year, as a result of asthma, about 1 in 8 Michigan students miss more than six days of school. Diesel exhaust is a common trigger of asthma.

""And so, that's like a big driver for why we want cleaner buses,"" Weid said. ""Some kids throughout rural Michigan are on the bus for a very long time, and that means that their exposure to diesel exhaust is extensive on the drive in and the drive home.""

Katrina Morris, the executive director of MAPT, is from West Shore Educational Service District in Northwest Michigan. She transports about 130 students across distances the size of Delaware. She hopes the cleaner-powered buses will yield quieter rides, which provide a better environment for students susceptible to sound issues.

""We carry a lot of severely, multiply impaired children that have severe needs, medical needs,"" Morris said. ""And so this will help them to be able to have that safer ride, which is what we are all here for.""

Already, though, the program has faced challenges at the federal level. Districts relying on federal funding were ""left in the dark,"" Hansbarger said.

They didn't know when those funds were to be released, so they didn't know how much they had available to them. So, they didn't know how much they needed from Michigan to complete their projects.

Other districts had chosen a bus company, like Lion Electric, that stopped servicing the U.S.

Not all the cleaner-powered buses have been purchased or entered into service yet. The grant will provide a final $44 million round of investment. Applications are due Dec. 18.

Tesla Valuation Stays Steady

The Q3 2025 results report will take place next week on October 22 after the closing bell.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) ended the week at $439.31 share, extending a consistent climb to more than 6% this year and 95% over the past 12 months. Does Wall Street strength indicate that Tesla might exceed what had been cautious forecasts for Q3 2025? Once-dour Tesla analyst expressions seem to be slightly revised, with some projecting Tesla will report third-quarter earnings per share of $0.54, down from $0.72 a year earlier.

Tesla delivered 497,099 cars (481,166 Model 3/Y and 15,933 other models) worldwide in the third quarter, setting a new record. The figure rose 7.4% from the year-ago quarter, after three consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline.

How will the new, basic Tesla Model Y and Model 3 versions stabilize numbers? Tesla has finally begun to appeal to a less affluent audience by introducing new so-called Standard versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV priced $5,000–$5,500 less than before.

Tesla continues to be the best selling EVs in the US market, estimated at 43.1% at the end of September. Yes, those numbers are down from 49% Y2Y. The EV competition is knocking at the Austin door, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

US residents bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired September 30. Those sales became the highest number of EVs sold in a single quarter, amounting to 11% of all new car sales and beating the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive. It’s also interesting to note that nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive.

The federal tax credits did help rejuvenate Tesla. Its overall financial health equation continues to be fortified by strong brand loyalty. With earlier quarters on a roller coaster, it hasn’t hurt that Musk recently added about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.

Tesla is positioned to look to its increasing energy generation and storage revenues as sustaining factors. The Megapack and Powerwall products continue to grow in popularity. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage, reflecting an increase from 6.9 GWh in the corresponding quarter of 2024 and setting a new record.

But, on the less optimistic side, did a consumer rush to cash in on the credits artificially inflate Tesla value in Q3? Loss of EV federal tax incentives may have an effect on the upcoming quarter’s bottom line — the Tesla Q4 2025 report may look very different. The stock is up more than 7% for the year, but some analysts interpret that as a fleeting moment in time. Pessimists see Q4 with a stark Tesla revenue drop, which will feed into 2025 becoming the company’s first full-year decline on record.

One downward trend is Tesla’s lukewarm performance abroad. While Tesla doesn’t officially break down sales by region, as Yahoo! finance notes, the third-quarter jump is likely to have come from the US. In Europe, however, the company’s performance is flaccid, with demand on the rise from both legacy automakers and Chinese EV players.

Tesla shares did fall early in the year due to brand competition, but Musk’s boorish behavior had the most significant detrimental effect. Clearly, siding with anti-EV Trump, his DOGE damage to federal careers and alleged data theft, and his outspoken support of Germany’s AfD party pushed Tesla stock to new lows.

The market for used EVs is also booming and could become an offsetting factor in new EV sales.

Musk’s Pay Package: Back in the Courts

This week the Delaware Supreme Court heard another iteration of arguments about Musk’s record-setting pay package. The saga began in 2018. In lieu of a salary, Tesla gave Musk incentives to help the company grow and prosper at the rate of 10× that year’s valuation. Tesla states that Musk, indeed, met those goals in 2022.

But not everyone was impressed. The Tesla board of directors was accused of violating their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of shareholders and the company overall. With so much board influence, the thought was that the board couldn’t objectively analyze Musk’s actual performance. A lack of alleged board transparency about informing shareholders also fed into the case, with various board members’ personal ties to Musk not fully revealed.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Tesla investors vote against Musk’s colossal pay package, describing it as ‘excessive’ and insufficiently tied to safeguards for shareholders.

Judge Kathaleen McCormick determined that the amount to be awarded Musk was an “unfathomable sum,” and she instructed Tesla to rethink the compensation package. Shareholders in 2024 didn’t listen and passed it again. The volley back to McCormick didn’t work out as shareholders wished, as she rejected that vote, too. A new vote, she stated, wasn’t what she asked for: developing a new plan.

Now it’s up to Delaware’s State Supreme Court. Could it be construed that Musk influenced the board but did not control it?

Tesla’s board of directors now has a new, future compensation package on the table for Musk. Hear ye, hear ye: all bow to the world’s first trillionaire.

Here are the best ten EV lease deals in October 2025.
However, the lease rate in this case is $551 per month over 48 months, with $8,510 due at signing.","The removal of the EV tax credit was thought to pose an existential threat to the adoption of electric vehicles in the US. The sentiment was even more acute because many legacy carmakers had signaled they wanted to scale back their EV plans way before the tax credit ended. However, many people will continue to purchase EVs in the future, and the adoption rate is expected to accelerate.

Not all carmakers are on board with electrification, but those who bet on EVs will reap the benefits. This might explain why many appear unfazed by the new market conditions. There are still great deals on EVs, and more pop up every day. Some carmakers have adjusted to the new reality by cutting the prices of their EVs, as they tried to compensate for the loss of the tax credit.

Hyundai is a prime example, with the 2026 Ioniq 5 starting at $35,000 and significant discounts offered on the 2025 models. Others bet on more affordable models launching into the market, such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y Standard.

The Detroit Three carmakers believed they could circumvent the system by purchasing the EVs directly through their financing subsidiaries. This way, they could access the federal tax credit and pass the savings on to the customer. However, this approach, while creative, backfired spectacularly when the government fought back. They have since stopped offering the tax credit savings and, in some cases, sold the vehicles through auctions.

Another reason we continue to see very tempting offers is that carmakers anticipate slow sales in the fourth quarter. Traditionally one of the best in a year, the Q4 2025 could be flat at best. That's because the expiration date on the EV tax credit prompted many who intended to buy an EV this year to do it in the third quarter. As a result, fewer people will buy a new EV in the fourth quarter.

We may not see lease contracts with monthly payments as low as $89 or $129 as we did in the past months, mainly because there will not be a tax credit to lower the costs. However, we've still found many attractive deals, with monthly payments as low as $189 for the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, both in SE Standard Range specifications. Here are the best ten EV lease deals in October 2025.

1. 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE SR

MSRP: from $44,075

Lease: from $189 for 36 months with $3,999 due at signing

The 2025 Ioniq 5 RWD SE SR model can be leased for just $189 per month over 36 months, with $3,999 due at signing. However, I urge you to consider the SE trim for a monthly rate of $199. For only $10 more per month, you get a significantly improved EV.

Instead of a 63-kWh battery providing a maximum range of 245 miles (394 km), the SE model features an 84-kWh battery pack, offering a maximum range of 318 miles (512 km). It also offers 225 horsepower, up from 168 horsepower, for the SE SR model.

Thanks to its impressive feature package, the Ioniq 5 is easily the most popular Hyundai EV. As the first model built on Hyundai's E-GMP platform, the Ioniq 5 introduced the 800-volt architecture to the masses. The main benefit is crazy-fast charging, with less than 20 minutes needed to charge from 10% to 80% when using an 800-volt DC fast charger.

2. 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE SR

MSRP: from $39,045

Lease: from $189 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

This funny-looking electric sedan shares the E-GMP platform with the Ioniq 5 below but adds the benefit of an aerodynamically optimized body. The Ioniq 6 boasts an impressive 0.22 drag coefficient, which is why it offers one of the longest ranges in its segment, at 342 miles (550 km). That, of course, if it's equipped with the bigger 77-kWh battery.

If the lower range (240 mi/386 km) suits your driving habits, Hyundai offers a deal on the Ioniq 6 RWD SE Standard Range. You can have it for $189 per month for 24 months, with $3,999 due at signing. For the money, you'll get a single-motor configuration with 149 horsepower and a 53-kWh battery, good for 240 miles (386 km) of range.

However, it's better to upgrade to the full EV package for $10 more per month. The Ioniq 6 SE retains the RWD configuration but with a 225-hp motor and a range estimated at 342 miles (550 km). For these benefits, the small surcharge is well worth paying.

3. 2025 Kia Niro EV Wind

MSRP: from $41,045

Lease: from $209 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

The Kia Niro EV is not the newest or most compelling EV, but it's worth considering at these rates. The entry-level 2025 Niro EV Wind can be leased for $209 per month over 24 months, with $3,999 due at signing. It's a lot more than it used to be for an arguably inferior EV compared to the two Hyundai EVs, but you can't be too picky these days.

The 2025 Kia Niro was launched last November, following a thorough revision in 2022. Although a little long in the tooth, the Niro EV Wind offers a decent 253-mile (407 km) range from a 65-kWh battery. The Niro EV doesn't have a heat pump fitted as standard, so be sure to purchase it with the Preserve Package ($1,300).

On the plus side, the equipment is rich, even in the Wind base trim. This includes dual 10.25-inch screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system, an eight-speaker audio system from Harman Kardon, and a bi-tone interior theme for the Wave top trim. A comprehensive driver-assist package is also standard, making the Niro EV a compelling proposition.

4.2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E Select RWD

MSRP: from $32,435

Lease: from $219 for 24 months with $4,499 due at signing

Ford is losing money on every EV it sells, but that hasn't stopped it from selling its electric vehicles at very attractive prices. This likely explains why sales have increased recently, despite strong competition from Tesla, GM, and Hyundai/Kia. The 2025 Mustang Mach-E is now available with a very attractive lease contract.

The electric Mustang can be leased for $219 per month with $4,499 due at signing on a 24-month contract. There's a mileage limit of 21,000 miles for the duration of the contract, with each extra mile costing $0.20. The low monthly rate is made possible by an $8,750 incentive package that is applied to the sticker price.

In its heyday, the compact crossover has been praised as one of the best rivals to the Tesla Model Y. The Select RWD trim offers a respectable 264 horsepower, and the 73-kWh standard-range battery allows it to travel up to 260 miles (418 km) on a charge. Charging the battery from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes.

5. 2025 Subaru Solterra Premium

MSRP: from $39,915

Lease: from $279 for 36 months with $2,278 due at signing

The 2025 Subaru Solterra still has a very attractive lease offer at $279 per month on a 36-month contract. This expires on October 31 and is available in all states except Hawaii. Although Subaru has already announced the 2026 model, it is not yet available for order.

If the 2025 Solterra looks familiar, it's because it's a Toyota bZ4X in disguise. Surprisingly, Subaru opted for a more radical redesign with the 2026 model. The changes are equally thorough under the hood, where it has incorporated the latest technology introduced by the newer Toyota bZ.

The 2025 Subaru Solterra charges from 10% to 80% in 35 minutes, which is still slower than most EVs. Subaru packs Eye-Sight with supervised hands-free driving at speeds up to 25 mph (40 kph) as standard, as well as standard roof rails with a static load capacity rated up to 700 pounds (318 kg).

6. 2025 VinFast VF 8 Eco

MSRP: from $41,100

Lease: from $279 for 24 months with $0 due at signing

VinFast is a Vietnamese carmaker that vowed to upend the US car market. However, its EVs have been harshly criticized for poor build quality and software problems. Hopefully, the carmaker has solved most of these issues. The good news is that VinFast lowered the price of the VF8, partly offsetting the loss of the tax credit.

The electric crossover retails for $41,100 in the Eco trim, compared to $47,200 previously. This makes the lease offer interesting, at $279 monthly for 24 months with a $0 downpayment. VinFast also offers a 10-year/125,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a 10-year/unlimited-mile battery warranty, providing peace of mind.

For the money, you get a Tesla Model Y-sized crossover with a standard dual-motor configuration. The Eco base variant delivers 349 horsepower, while the 87.7-kWh battery pack allows it to travel up to 256 miles (412 km) on a charge. Not quite impressive, considering that the $48,990 Tesla Model Y AWD offers 327 miles (526 km).

7. 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV 2WD LT

MSRP: from $43,295

Lease: from $279 for 24 months with $2,229 due at signing

Surprisingly, the Chevrolet Equinox retains the monthly payments of the tax-credit era, although the downpayment has increased. At $279 per month with $2,229 due at signing, this is still a good deal. You can have it if you take delivery by October 31.

The Chevrolet Equinox EV 2WD LT has a front-wheel drive and an 85 kW battery capable of keeping the car going for 319 miles (513 km) on a charge. The battery can be charged at 150 kW, adding up to 77 miles of range in 10 minutes of charging. An optional eAWD variant with a range of 285 miles (460 km) is also offered.

While the Chevy Equinox EV looks compelling on paper, it also has the disadvantage of less polished software. GM likely ironed out many issues lately. However, it's still not on par with the industry benchmark Tesla, which makes the lack of support for Android Auto/Apple CarPlay even more painful.

8. 2025 Honda Prologue AWD Touring

MSRP: from $56,195

Lease: from $289 for 36 months with $3,899 due at signing

The 2025 Honda Prologue AWD Touring starts at $289 per month on a 36-month contract in California and other ZEV states, with $3,899 due at signing. The offer is available to owners of non-luxury car brands that are model year 2010 or newer.

For this money, you get the ""Japanese"" variant of the Chevrolet Blazer EV, sharing similar drivetrain and battery components. The Touring AWD trim features a dual-motor configuration powered by an 85-kWh battery pack, allowing it up to 294 miles (473 km) on a charge.

The Honda Prologue has a substantial advantage over its Chevy counterpart, primarily due to the support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that GM does not offer on its EVs. Honda claims the longest wheelbase in its class (121.8 in/3,094 mm), providing impressive cabin space.

9. 2025 Kia EV6 Light LR

MSRP: from $47,695

Lease: from $309 for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing

This costs significantly more to lease than the Kia Niro EV, but it's well worth the price. However, its biggest competitor is its Hyundai cousin, the Ioniq 5, which is much cheaper to lease. Ultimately, it comes down to how much you like the EV6's polarizing design.

The 2025 Kia EV6 Long Range RWD model in the Light trim is available for $309 per month, with $3,999 due at signing for a 24-month contract. The powertrain develops 225 horsepower from a single-motor configuration. Thanks to an 84-kWh battery pack, it can go up to 319 miles (513 km) on a charge.

The Kia EV6 boasts very short charging times when plugged into a 350-kW charger, needing only 20 minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. This is as fast as you can get on a volume model and is one of its unique selling points. As a family model, you might consider the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which offers a larger trunk. However, the Kia EV6 scores better in sportiness.

10. 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning XLT

MSRP: from $55,135

Lease: from $321 for 24 months with $6,915 due at signing

This incredible offer speaks volumes about what Ford is willing to do to sell its electric pickup truck. Although the $6,915 due at signing is rather steep, the $321 monthly payment is almost nothing for an electric truck well-equipped like the F-150 Lightning XLT.

Its only letdown is that it comes with the Standard Range battery (98 kWh), which can only go 240 miles (386 km) on a charge. If you want the most range, you'll have to splurge on the F-150 Lightning Lariat. However, the lease rate in this case is $551 per month over 48 months, with $8,510 due at signing.

Thanks to an Extended Range battery with a 131-kWh capacity, the Lariat variant can go up to 320 miles (515 km) on a charge. Even this is not enough if you want to use the truck for towing. This might explain why the electric F-150 is not as popular as its combustion-powered brother.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/the-tax-credit-is-gone-but-electric-car-lease-deals-are-as-sweet-as-ever-in-october-2025-259402_1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 14:04:11.203876

What Is the EV Tax Credit?

Part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the EV tax credit incentivized new car buyers to purchase EVs by giving them a $7,500 tax credit when buying a qualifying new EV. For instance, a new $40,000 EV would ultimately cost $32,500 after the $7,500 was claimed. It was a healthy incentive, covering a significant portion of a new EV’s final cost. That incentive has now been eliminated by the OBBBA.

That’s not the only pricing issue currently facing EVs.

Tariffs Are Keeping EVs Expensive

As reported by Business Insider, even the standard versions of Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y are no longer cheap at $36,990 and $39,990 respectively. A crucial reason for this is that many of the necessary minerals needed to construct EV batteries are both mined and processed in China, where they face a 93.5% tariff tax to come to America.

Imposing not only a steep tariff but also one with unpredictable terms makes planning extremely difficult, Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, told Business Insider. He also said if he were in the auto industry, considering production of electric or hybrid models and the integration of multiple batteries, he’d be unsure how to proceed.

Experts Weigh In: Are EVs Still Worth Buying?

Should you still consider an EV, even without the tax credit? According to Dave Thomas, director of content marketing and auto industry analyst at CDK Global, the answer is a hesitant yes. “If you are truly concerned [about] how much you will be paying out of pocket for the next five years, EVs will mostly likely still be the right pick,” he said.

“Many [automakers] are discounting EVs by $7,500 to offset the loss of the incentives. If you search your local dealership’s inventory you might find some with significantly bigger discounts,” Thomas explained.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Vnl3dPwxH6znN192dtBfBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/a599228de6616a2733d6c7be1b4589e2,N,,2025-10-18 13:02:03.643222

The COP 30 Circle of Finance Ministers, coordinated by Fernando Haddad, Brazil’s finance minister (pictured), set out five priorities which it will present at the summit in Belem in November.
The other four are: reform multilateral development banks; boost domestic capacity for climate finance; find ways to mobilise private capital; and strengthen regulation of climate finance.
“Every year of delayed climate action raises both the investment needed and the risks faced,” the ministers said.
“Climate action is central to both economic stability and development,” said Matia Kasaija, Ugandan finance minister and co-chair of the Coalition.","If financial leaders act urgently to increase climate investments they could unlock a $1tr-a-year growth opportunity that would create hundreds of millions of jobs and protect lives, according to three reports on Thursday.

Two separate alliances of finance ministers called for climate finance to be magnified to the 2035 target of $1.3tr a year set by last year’s COP 29 climate summit.

Meanwhile, a consortium of 20 thinktanks, NGOs and universities said investment in climate resilience and nature projects could create more than 280m jobs in emerging and developing countries by 2035, boosting the most vulnerable states’ economies by as much as 15%.

The COP 30 Circle of Finance Ministers, coordinated by Fernando Haddad, Brazil’s finance minister (pictured), set out five priorities which it will present at the summit in Belem in November.

It said mobilising finance to hit $1.3tr would require “structured and sustained efforts” by public and private bodies. Its top priority is to scale up concessional finance and make best use of climate funds. The other four are: reform multilateral development banks; boost domestic capacity for climate finance; find ways to mobilise private capital; and strengthen regulation of climate finance.

The Circle, which includes countries as diverse as the UK and the Marshall Islands, said inaction on climate change disproportionately exposed the most vulnerable populations — which had contributed least to emissions — to “escalating climate risks”.

“Every year of delayed climate action raises both the investment needed and the risks faced,” the ministers said. “Urgent and coordinated action is indispensable to safeguard lives, livelihoods and sustainable growth.”

Meanwhile, the older 70-strong Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action issued a strong case for the economic benefits of tackling global warming.

They said the pro-climate policies Coalition members had enacted had enabled their economies to seize opportunities from the transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient economy.

“Climate action is central to both economic stability and development,” said Matia Kasaija, Ugandan finance minister and co-chair of the Coalition. “Finance ministries [are] playing a more pertinent role in climate policies — aligning fiscal policy with climate priorities… and working towards a more predictable environment for unlocking the investment needed.”

The Coalition has published a database of more than 500 climate policy actions by member countries. It showed that two thirds of countries were scaling up green bonds, emissions trading systems and blended finance to mobilise private capital for climate action. One in seven was integrating climate risks into public financial management while one in 10 was introducing carbon taxes, phasing out harmful subsidies and expanding clean energy incentives.

“By aligning fiscal and general financial policies with climate objectives, we can create clear, predictable frameworks that attract investment, support innovation and ensure the transition strengthens — not destabilises — our economies,” said Marko Primorac, incoming co-chair and Croatia’s finance minister.

The Returns on Resilience report, launched by 20 partners, analysed the economic and financial benefits of investment in climate adaptation. It found that the adaptation and resilience market could reach $1.3tr annually by 2030, while saving some of the 1m-2m additional deaths expected annually by 2050 without action.

The report also calculated the cost of failing to act. Temperature and rainfall shifts have already destroyed at least $525bn of economic expansion over the past 20 years in developing nations.

Launching the report, Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados and architect of the Bridgetown Initiative on climate finance reform, said: “We continue to recognise that the work of building resilience is at the core of everything that we do.”

Reports from industry experts state that Europe hit record wind power curtailments during the first nine months of 2025. The world’s leaders have reaffirmed the need to diversify the energy sector; however, the troubling trend that has emerged in Europe points to some concerning issues that European nations will need to contend with to shift the sector towards a more inclusive stance for the wind power sector.

European grids were unable to dispatch the surge in renewable energy output during this year

The progress that the global community has made in advancing the wind sector beyond memorandum’s of understanding towards the practical implementation of projects that drive the sector forward.

While that progress is commendable, a worrying trend has emerged in Europe. When a situation arises where renewable energy output threatens to overwhelm grids, operators are often paid to reduce generation from their renewable energy assets. This has led to Europe hitting record wind power curtailments during the first nine months of 2025.

Curtialment rates have risen in several nations, including Spain, Germany, France, and southern Sweden during the first nine months of the year, underscoring the issues faced by the wind power sector in the region. Among the worrying increases in curtailment rates are:

Spain jumped to 12.2% this year from 9% last year

France increased to 5.3% from 3.8%

Germany’s curtailment rate inched up to 4.9% from 4.5%

South Sweden’s curtailment rate was 2.4%, up from 2.0% a year earlier

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last month that the EU plans to address critical grid bottlenecks, which have exacerbated the curtailment rates in the region.

A review of the EU’s electricity grids by the European Court of Auditors has outlined the required budget for the sector

The estimation that the EU Commission has laid out notes that $2.36 trillion to $2.7 trillion is required to meet grid needs until 2050; without it, the sector will face significant shortages that could devastate the region.

President Ursula von der Leyen notes that European nations’ national grids are not well integrated, as they lack the necessary interconnectors. The curtailment rates in Europe are the polar opposite of what is taking place in the MENA region, which has seen Africa’s largest wind farm being completed ahead of schedule.

Industry insiders have echoed the problems being faced in Europe.

“Less new wind is bad news for Europe’s wider competitiveness. Industry in Europe is craving cheap electricity to compete with China and the US. But too many Governments remain half-hearted in their expansion of wind. This is not only threatening the wind sector. It’s also jeopardising jobs and growth more widely – in steel, chemicals and ICT. Doing business in Europe is so much harder for them if the EU can’t deliver on its energy targets” – WindEurope CEO, Giles Dickson

However, an innovative social enterprise is doing its bit to help by offering people the chance to reduce their electricity bills by as much as 30%.

Energy Local is a non-profit organisation that has created a way for people to benefit from local clean energy by teaming up with a renewable energy project in their area – it might be a wind turbine, solar farm or hydroelectric scheme – to get a better deal.

It enables participating residents to buy renewable electricity at a discounted price.

They form a club, which their local renewable project also joins, and it works by matching up the residents’ energy usage to the locally generated electricity. The club agrees a price residents will pay for the electricity they use when the local renewable energy is being generated.

In Bridport in Dorset, the installation of a wind turbine by the local farmer Peter Bailey in one of his fields allowed an energy club to be set up in 2021. Almost 60 people are signed up to the club, and the connection between local energy generation and usage is already having an impact on how members behave.

“Peter believes wind power of about 11mph produces sufficient power for it to generate. You know on a windy day that it’s generating power,” says Malcolm Drew, a semi-retired engineer and energy club member.

“The website we can access tells us what the turbine is doing – it picks up on wind speed and tells you how windy it is and if it’s a good time to use electricity,” he adds.

Richard Toft, who helped to found the club, says: “We’re all saving. Depending on your personal habits, people save a different proportion – anywhere between a 10% and 25% reduction on your bill.”

There are many more people interested in joining the Bridport club than available spaces but there are hopes that it can set up a solar farm based on a cooperative investment model to expand the project and allow more members to join.

Energy Local was set up by Dr Mary Gillie in 2016 after she witnessed a surprising frustration among people living in Ashton Hayes, Cheshire, who wanted their small village to become carbon neutral.

“They said: ‘Can we all just put solar power on our roofs? How do we then say that we’ve used that power?’” Gillie says.

“But at the time, we couldn’t show when they were using it. It was when smart meters began to be developed that I realised we could do that.”

There are now 36 energy clubs across Great Britain that Energy Local is involved with, stretching from Scotland down to Devon and Dorset. The idea behind them is simple. Thanks to smart meter technology, it is now possible to show how much electricity a household uses every half an hour. Energy Local has developed software that compares that usage with the electricity generated by a local renewable energy scheme such as a wind turbine, hydro project or solar farm.

Gillie and her team have worked with energy companies to negotiate a special tariff arrangement, thereby creating a “hyper-local” market that acknowledges the renewable power being generated in that area.

The price the club members pay for the electricity they use when the local clean energy is being generated is higher than the amount the renewable energy projects would normally get from selling their power to suppliers but lower than the price residents would usually pay via a regular tariff. “It’s a win-win,” Gillie says.

In Brixton, south London, Energy Local has helped unlock the potential of an existing solar project on the roof of a social housing block called Roupell Park. The photovoltaic panels on the building’s roof were installed in 2013 thanks to a community investment initiative organised by the not-for-profit organisation Repowering London.

“Everyone, as investor members, owns a piece of that kit on the roof [in Roupell Park],” says Afsheen Kabir Rashid, the co-founder and chief executive of Repowering London.

“It’s really empowering for local people. But we kept coming back to this point: how can we supply this energy locally? Energy Local has been one of the models that has allowed us to do that.

“It’s a small trial in Brixton – 18 households or so – but they have seen benefits on their energy bills already.”

Repowering London raises money for the solar panels through community shares. It believes that democratising the energy system is the fastest route to decarbonising the sector and making it fairer. “We still have huge fuel poverty in the UK,” Kabir Rashid says. “People are scared about the bills that arrive. People are disconnected from where the energy is coming from. The benefits of the extractive fossil fuel economy do not stay local in people’s pockets. But through community energy, we can bring people closer, make it visible.”

When the sun is weak or there is no wind, the energy club members have to pay a higher tariff – however, part of the aim of Energy Local is to encourage people to change their consumption habits.

Gillie says that as well as trying to support local renewable energy and reduce people’s bills, “we want to manage the electricity network as efficiently as we can … If we can get people to use more power when local generation is running or when fewer people are using it, we can solve both problems.”

Electricity demand is typically greatest between 4pm and 8pm but Energy Local encourages participants to set timers for washing machines and similar devices, and to try to move energy-intensive tasks to the times of day when local clean power generation is running at maximum levels and electricity is at its cheapest.

While the idea of hyper-local energy markets and cooperative renewable power generation may sound like a perfect solution to the energy crisis, Gillie is clear that community energy schemes cannot replace the national grid entirely.

“We need a robust overarching system to ensure the power keeps flowing,” she says. “We do as much as we can locally, but after a point [infrastructure costs] can become too expensive, and that’s where you need things to be handled at a national level.”

Those infrastructure costs, such as repairing and upgrading the cables and equipment that electrify our homes and businesses, are one reason why bills, including standing charges, have just gone up. On 1 October, the average energy price cap for households in Great Britain paying by direct debit increased by £35 to £1,755 for a typical annual dual-fuel bill.

“Our network is changing – we need to invest in it. We should have done this 15 years ago, and we’re playing catchup on a massive scale,” Gillie says.

Given the desire within the industry to wean the grid off gas turbine power stations and lower consumer prices by bringing more renewable power into play, well-integrated local energy generation sites offer a glimpse of what a more efficient, carbon neutral network may look like in the future.

How do Energy Local clubs work, and how do I join one?

They are designed to solve a problem in the electricity market: renewable energy schemes sell their power to suppliers but people living nearby are buying that electricity back for maybe two or three times that price.

An Energy Local club is legally a cooperative and is where a group of residents and a local renewable energy project team up to get a better deal for both parties.

To take part, you need a smart meter installed in your home.

The club agrees a price people will pay for the electricity they use when renewable energy is being generated locally. So they may want to run their washing machine when they know the local hydro scheme is going full pelt, for example. Sometimes it will be possible to match all the electricity someone uses to locally generated power but at other times they will use more than is available. For the extra electricity, they will be charged at different rates depending on the time of day.

The club selects a partner energy supplier that sells the extra power that members need when there is not enough local electricity generated. So those taking part will have to change to the supplier selected.

Energy Local says the savings will vary from household to household but adds: “We estimate you could save about 10% to 30% on your electricity bills.” However, club members still have to pay standing charges.

The organisation has created an online dashboard to help people manage their energy use. It can provide a forecast of how much power will come from the local renewable energy source each day.

If you would like to join an Energy Local club, there is a list on the organisation’s website of clubs that are up and running or being set up (some are now full). If there isn’t one in your area but you would like to be notified if one is set up, there is a form on the site where you can register your details. “We have clubs developing in many areas. Please let us know you are interested,” the organisation says.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f432609de10e14df0dc391db3955f37292e1a85/802_449_3466_2774/master/3466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48b025ac2dd3200ab32b6fc13361a0ca",N,,2025-10-18 12:09:49.260557

Operators in East Texas commonly injected wastewater into mid-depth formations such as the Rodessa-Gloyd interval, between 4,500 and 7,500 feet deep.

Across major shale-producing basins, particularly East Texas and the Permian, excessive wastewater injection practices have created areas with extreme overpressure, driving up the cost of new drilling operations and threatening the economic viability of shale production in many locations. It’s also destroying fresh water aquifers, causing earthquakes and causing whack-a-mole poisonous salt geysers, but apparently that’s not so big a concern in the state.

The irony is clear. Short-sighted disposal practices, meant to cheaply handle large volumes of wastewater, have led directly to increased operational expenses for everyone operating in these basins. This industry-wide phenomenon is effectively a textbook example of the tragedy of the commons, but hitting the oil and gas industry in its pocket book instead of regular joes. Would that climate change had the same level of attention, concern and impact.

The immediate challenge stems from massive volumes of produced wastewater being injected into underground formations at increasingly high pressures. Historically, shale producers viewed wastewater disposal as an inexpensive side operation, a cost line item small enough to remain mostly unnoticed on balance sheets. Operators in East Texas commonly injected wastewater into mid-depth formations such as the Rodessa-Gloyd interval, between 4,500 and 7,500 feet deep.

Over the years, this led to the gradual but steady buildup of subsurface pressures. Today, many injection wells are pumping wastewater at pressures above the natural fracture gradient, unintentionally fracturing formations and allowing pressurized wastewater to migrate upward and laterally into unintended zones. As pressure increases, the operational complexity of drilling new wells escalates dramatically.

The direct operational impacts are now clearly visible. Operators face increasingly frequent challenges when drilling into these overpressured formations. Elevated…",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*SNxBV7_zil-z4JXYQWw0_A.png,N,,2025-10-18 16:03:52.599936

Healey also urged the department to speed up the connection of solar resources to the grid before a federal tax credit expires.

The directive comes as residents face high energy costs and the state's utility regulation department undergoes leadership changes.

Gov. Maura Healey ordered utilities regulators Tuesday to start combing through gas and electric bill charges line by line to reduce or remove any that don't provide a benefit to ratepayers as they gird for the winter heating season.

""Everybody knows what we're dealing with. It's not just a Massachusetts issue, it's a problem throughout the Northeast, and we've just got to act with just incredible urgency to do everything we can to lower costs. And that means this as well, looking at bills, looking at charges, and getting rid of charges that aren't justified, that aren't providing that customer benefit,"" the governor said.

The order to the Department of Public Utilities, delivered in a letter Tuesday, calls for the department to ""review each and every charge that customers are currently paying to determine whether the charge can be eliminated, reduced or its impact mitigated."" Healey also instructed the DPU to ""rigorously review"" the rate increases proposed by utilities ""to avoid unnecessary spending and drive down costs.""

Energy bills soared for many Bay Staters last winter, exacerbating chronic cost-of-living pressures for residents and businesses that already pay some of the highest energy prices in the country and calling attention to the state clean energy and climate mandates some say are driving elevated costs. Healey already shaved $50 off April electricity bills and in March announced a series of executive actions designed to spur savings of nearly $6 billion over the next five years.

Healey said the actions she announced Tuesday add to her energy affordability agenda, which includes major legislation that fellow Democrats have been largely cool towards. The governor did not attach a timeline to her order and did not directly answer when asked if she expects that DPU would be able to take action in time to influence this winter's heating bills.

""I made my request today to the DPU. I think this is something they've got to get after right away,"" she responded during a press conference in her office. She added, ""The bottom line is that gas and electric bills are too high, too volatile, for people in the Northeast, and so we're doing everything we can within our power to cut them down.""

Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper said it is infrastructure and supply costs that are driving the increases in gas and electric bills.

""So what this does is to look at all the charges -- including looking at the utilities and how they're spending money on infrastructure -- and making sure that we're using it as efficiently as we can, the stuff we currently have, and that we're building stuff in a way that's the most cost effective,"" she said.

In her letter to the DPU, the governor also urged the department to hasten its proceedings that are necessary for more solar resources to connect to the grid so that Bay Staters can take advantage before the federal residential clean energy tax credit is eliminated at the end of the year.

""Massachusetts ratepayers cannot afford to lose out on the cheapest and fastest energy that can get built,"" Healey said.

Republican candidate for governor Brian Shortsleeve said Healey had driven up energy costs by opposing gas pipelines and supporting fees and mandates that add to energy costs.

""On Day One in office, I’ll end the mandates and hidden taxes that made our bills skyrocket and make affordability the driving factor in our energy policy,"" Shortsleeve said in a statement.

Healey's order to the DPU arrives to a department in flux. The governor in August announced her second shake-up of the DPU membership in about two and a half years, and that transition is in progress.

Cecile Fraser, an energy and utilities industry attorney first appointed to the DPU in 2017, was replaced last month by Jeremy McDiarmid, who had been running the national business association Advanced Energy United. Next week, Liz Anderson, the chief of the Energy and Ratepayer Advocacy Division in Attorney General Andrea Campbell's office, will take Chairman James Van Nostrand's spot as a commissioner and McDiarmid will become chair of the DPU.

Soil scientist Christina Hebb asked a room of solar developers to picture this scene at a conference here last week of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the nonprofit that advocates for the solar industry.

“Planting flowering species help re-establish pollinator habitat and increase pollinator species that not only benefits the site but will increase production and crop yields for neighbouring properties. So it’s very helpful, not to mention people driving past the solar farm and they’re like, ‘Wow, that actually looks really good,’” said Hebb.

Hebb works to manage the soil of solar projects planned, built and managed by the company she works for, McCarthy Building Companies, which develops and constructs large-scale solar projects across the country, often on former farmland.

As the United States builds and maintains more solar farms, attention is turning to how to make them more sustainable. Much of that focus is on the ground beneath the panels, where developers are learning how to manage soil to meet permit requirements, reduce costs and protect the land. Hebb saw this shift firsthand after joining McCarthy as its in-house soil scientist in 2021, following years as a consultant.

Expanding solar farms reshape landscapes and nearby communities. Building them can clear vegetation and compact soil, disturbing drainage, crops and ecosystems. More developers now recognize that healthy soil supports both local livelihoods and the durability of their projects.

Flowers help keep weeds from overtaking the soil beneath solar panels, making it easier for maintenance crews to work safely and reducing the risk of fire. But planting flowers is only one of many steps developers can take to make solar farms more sustainable.

Some solar farms have planted low-growing grasses that sheep graze on, keeping vegetation in check while providing local farmers with pasture income. Others have introduced barn owls to hunt prey that chew on wires and nest inside electrical equipment, showing how tending to both the surface and the soil can make solar energy systems more resilient.

In the Southwest, researchers have found that growing crops beneath solar panels can help both plants and panels thrive. Shade from the panels protects crops from extreme heat while moisture from the vegetation cools the panels and boosts their efficiency. Farmers in Arizona and Colorado have reported higher yields and lower irrigation needs in these so-called “agrivoltaic” systems.

These practices echo a growing body of research showing that solar projects can improve soil health and local biodiversity when managed right. A 2019 National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) study found that native grasses planted beneath solar arrays improve soil structure, reduce erosion and even help cool panels, making them more efficient.

But these examples take place after construction has begun. Hebb urged developers to care for the soil long before the first panel arrives on site.

The very first thing developers should do, according to Hebb, is to consider the topsoil—the thin, dark layer usually 5 to 10 inches deep that lets plants grow and keeps the ground healthy.

Topsoil forms slowly, with just a few inches taking hundreds to thousands of years to accumulate as rocks break down and organic matter from plants and animals builds up. It holds most of the soil’s life and fertility, containing the microbes, nutrients and moisture that plants depend on. But construction work such as grading, scraping and heavy vehicle traffic can destroy it in days by compacting the ground and stripping away its living layer.

Too often, Hebb said, solar companies mix or scrape it away when “grading,” or leveling the ground to install rows of panels, leaving behind hard soil that can’t easily recover.

Hebb encouraged developers to map and save the topsoil before building begins, removing and storing it carefully so it can be spread back later. That way, once construction is done, the soil still has the nutrients and structure needed for grasses, flowers, or grazing pastures to take root in the decades that the solar farm stands and the many more once it’s decommissioned.

“I think one policy that I would recommend is that you have to save topsoil. Whether you save all the topsoil or you save a certain amount, I think topsoil needs to be saved because it is, in our lifetime, a non-renewable resource,” Hebb explained.

So far, only a few states require that kind of soil care. In places like New Jersey, construction projects must replace at least five inches of topsoil and loosen the ground underneath to prevent compaction once work is finished. In Virginia, new solar rules require developers to map and protect prime farmland and if more than 10 acres are disturbed, they must offset the loss through conservation or practices such as preserving and replacing topsoil, decompacting soil and maintaining vegetation.

At the federal level, the Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) released a fact sheet in 2024 encouraging developers to minimize soil disturbance, preserve topsoil and plant perennial or pollinator-friendly vegetation to stabilize the land.

For now, most solar companies follow these practices voluntarily, often driven by sustainability goals or local partnerships with farmers rather than by regulation.

For Amanda Pankau, a director at the conservation nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network in Chicago, the importance could not be emphasized enough. Pankau was a panelist at the conference on land stewardship—the idea that the energy transition can heal the land instead of just using it.

Pankau works with communities in Illinois, which is home to one of the most fertile soils in the world. According to data, less than 1 percent of Illinois prairie is left.

“My father was the state soil scientist of Illinois,” she said. “I grew up understanding the wealth of our soils. They developed here in central Illinois under 10,000 to 15,000 years of prairie vegetation.”

Those ancient prairies produced the dark, carbon-rich topsoil that sustains the state’s agriculture today. But that soil, Pankau explained, has been steadily depleted by decades of industrial farming.

“Over 60 percent of our land in Illinois is used for just three crops: corn, soybeans and wheat. And most of them are grown in a way that isn’t sustainable,” she said. Fertilizers and pesticides wash into rivers, while bare fields erode in windstorms that now recall the Dust Bowl.

“We have an opportunity with solar to improve upon the status quo,” said Pankau.

Solar arrives in a landscape shaped by a history of skepticism. Pankau explained that many rural residents she’s spoken with see the technology as a threat to farmland that “feeds the world.”

But she said that argument misses a crucial fact: much of Illinois’ corn goes to ethanol, not food. And the state imports about 95 percent of what its people eat.

“Solar is borrowing the land for a certain amount of time,” she said. “It can be returned to farming in the future.”

In Illinois, state law already requires Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreements, which dictate how solar projects handle soil and drainage under oversight from the Illinois Department of Agriculture.

“We’re lucky to have that,” Pankau said. “But there’s still room for improvement.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ohio-solar-project_Pollinator1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:10:16.038384

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its 2025 Winter Fuels Outlook, predicting that heating costs across the nation—including Oklahoma—will vary based on fuel type. The report shows that most natural gas users will see similar bills to last winter, while electric heating households may pay slightly more. In contrast, propane and heating oil users should experience modest savings.

EIA’s projection comes as Oklahoma utilities prepare for fluctuating seasonal demand. The agency says the retail price of heating fuel remains the biggest factor in determining total winter expenses.

Natural Gas Still Dominates in Oklahoma

Oklahoma relies heavily on natural gas to heat homes, with nearly two-thirds of residents depending on it during colder months. Because the state both produces and processes gas locally, Oklahomans often enjoy lower heating costs than the national average.

However, natural gas markets remain volatile. Slight changes in supply or weather could affect monthly utility bills. The EIA warns that a colder-than-normal winter could drive prices upward, while milder temperatures could keep rates steady or even lower.

Electric-heated homes may see higher bills due to rising generation costs tied to increased natural gas usage in power plants.

Weather Scenarios and Economic Impacts

EIA modeled both 10% colder and 10% warmer scenarios to gauge how weather affects heating budgets. Under colder conditions, all fuel costs rise. A warmer winter benefits propane and heating oil users most, while electricity costs remain high regardless.

Oklahoma consumers can track monthly EIA updates through March 2026 to monitor commodity price shifts and prepare for potential utility fluctuations.",,N,,2025-10-18 15:01:53.867521

For the environment, biogas systems help protect our air, water and soil.
And using digested material from biogas systems, plus additional technology, can reduce or eliminate runoff of nutrients into our waterways.
Not enough people know what biogas systems are, even though they already operate in all 50 states.
Amid skyrocketing energy demand, biogas offers a clean and efficient way to produce more power.","We can’t ignore the reality: America needs more power. An explosion in new AI data center construction, a reshoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing, plus the broader increase in electrification of homes and vehicles are all putting enormous pressure on our energy grid.

At the same time, we’re coming to terms with another stark reality: America is producing more waste than ever. Organic waste from farms, food systems, landfills and wastewater has reached historic new highs.

The Environmental Protection Agency reports that municipal solid waste levels have skyrocketed by more than 230 percent over the last five decades since 1960, with a significant portion being degradable organic material like food scraps.

These two categories of challenges — the need to produce energy and manage our waste — presents a powerful opportunity: We can transform this abundant waste into biogas and natural fertilizer to meet America’s energy and agricultural needs.

Biogas is a renewable energy source created through the breakdown of organic waste such as manure, food scraps, sewage and crop residues. This process yields methane-rich gas, used to make energy, and digestate, a nutrient-rich byproduct usable as fertilizer.

Capturing this methane, which will be produced anyway if the waste isn’t managed, is good for the earth’s atmosphere as well, since methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. We should capture as much of it as we can. Better still if the captured gas can also offset fossil fuel use for energy.

The benefits of biogas are undeniable. Biogas facilities produce energy 24/7, 365 days a year and have a reliability rate of 95 percent. Compared with solar and wind power — with approximately 25 percent and 35 percent reliability rates, respectively, depending on location — biogas provides us with one of the best options we have for sourcing power that is both reliable and renewable.

Beyond its consistent energy output, biogas plays a critical role in preserving America’s rural communities. Biogas systems can generate new revenue streams for communities and reduce costs for farmers.

By producing biogas and utilizing the leftover digestate for applications like animal bedding and natural fertilizer, farmers can achieve significant savings. This natural fertilizer, derived from digestate, can replace expensive synthetic fertilizers and has been shown to increase plant growth by 5 to 30 percent, further improving farm productivity.

For the environment, biogas systems help protect our air, water and soil. Air is improved through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from fossil energy. We protect our soil by recycling nutrients back into the land instead of using fossil-derived, synthetic fertilizers. And using digested material from biogas systems, plus additional technology, can reduce or eliminate runoff of nutrients into our waterways.

Despite these benefits, biogas remains an underutilized energy source with only 10 to 15 percent of the potential systems built so far. Industry data shows that the U.S. has over 17,000 potential new biogas systems waiting to be built to reduce our waste. Fully developing this potential could power millions of homes and displace substantial amounts of fossil-fuel use, all which benefiting American farms and businesses.

A global perspective underscores this opportunity. The International Energy Agency suggests that biogas and biomethane could collectively meet 20 percent of global gas demand.

For the U.S., embracing biogas is not just an environmental imperative but also a strategic move to reduce our dependence on volatile fossil-fuel markets. Internationally, the European Union has already recognized biogas production as an effective strategy to reduce reliance on gas imports from unfriendly nations.

Even national public opinion firmly supports investment in biogas, once Americans know what a biogas system does. The data show strong bipartisan backing, with over 80 percent of Americans supporting federal investments in converting waste to energy. They view biogas as a practical, local and environmentally responsible solution.

The catch? Not enough people know what biogas systems are, even though they already operate in all 50 states. Biogas is a proven, scalable energy solution that offers numerous benefits in the process. It cuts emissions, reduces waste, strengthens rural economies and meets our rising energy demands.

Amid skyrocketing energy demand, biogas offers a clean and efficient way to produce more power. The energy we need is already in our backyard — we just need to take advantage of it.

Hyderabad: The BRS leadership on Saturday slammed the Congress administration for fostering an environment of intimidation and extortion, particularly targeting industrialists and investors, in stark contrast to the previous BRS regime’s investor-friendly policies. The latest salvo came from party working president KT Rama Rao, who on Saturday highlighted the divide in governance styles. In a social media post, he contrasted the BRS’s “red carpet” welcome extended to investors during the K Chandrashekhar Rao era with what he described as Congress’s aggressive tactics.

“This was KCR Govt in action with respect to industry captains. Now we all know how the Congress Govt is dealing with industrialists,” he wrote while posting a visual from BRS investor summits held in the past, where he, as the then Minister for Industries, was holding an umbrella for a leading industrialist. The post reads – “BRS: Welcomes investors with respect. Congress: Threatens investors with guns. The difference is clear.” Earlier on Friday, BRS leader T Harish Rao demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into what he termed a “gun culture” infiltrating the Congress cabinet. Rao alleged that internal clashes among Ministers have escalated to threats involving firearms, with close aides to the Chief Minister allegedly using intimidation tactics to extract money from businesses.

“The CM is presiding over a cabinet where guns are drawn not just in personal feuds but against those who dare to invest in Telangana,” Rao said, pointing to reports of Ministers’ associates parading armed guards during meetings with company executives.

In January 2024, three districts each received $5.9 million in Clean School Bus Program funding to buy 15 clean-powered school buses apiece.
Reports at the time said five additional Michigan districts were expected to receive a total of 21 new clean buses through multistate Clean School Bus Program grants.
Groups such as the Michigan electric school bus coalition It’s Electric!","The number of clean-powered school buses in Michigan is on the rise.

A new round of investment totaling $35.9 million from the Michigan Department of Education’s Clean Bus Energy Grant program will help 23 schools and districts add 87 electric buses and 10 propane buses to fleets across the state, according to a community announcement.

“Children and others in their communities benefit from cleaner air,” Interim State Superintendent Sue C. Carnell, said in the announcement. “We are happy to work with our partners at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) to make our state greener. The Clean Bus Energy Grant program helps us move toward Goal 3 in Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan, to improve the health, safety and wellness of all learners.”

Grants are part of a larger effort

The new grants are the latest step in a clean-power transition for Michigan school transportation.

In 2019 and 2020, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy awarded about $13 million in grants through its now-closed Fuel Transformation Program toward the purchase of 317 electric, clean diesel and propane school buses and support infrastructure for more than 25 districts across the state.

In November 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency invested $54 million from its Clean School Bus Rebates program toward 138 new electric school buses and infrastructure for 25 Michigan school districts, from Southeast Michigan to the Upper Peninsula. The EPA’s Clean School Bus Program of grants and rebates provides $5 billion nationwide over fiscal years 2022-26.

In January 2024, three districts each received $5.9 million in Clean School Bus Program funding to buy 15 clean-powered school buses apiece. Reports at the time said five additional Michigan districts were expected to receive a total of 21 new clean buses through multistate Clean School Bus Program grants.

In May 2024, the Clean School Bus Program rebate competition announced $23.98 million to help 27 Michigan schools and districts buy 97 buses powered by electricity and three powered by propane.

Also in 2024, the Michigan Department of Education announced its first and second rounds of Clean Bus Energy Grant program funding: nearly $30 million in June to help 29 school districts and intermediate school districts buy a total of 114 buses powered by electricity, propane or natural gas; and $15.2 million in October to help 21 districts buy 40 electric buses and 17 propane buses.

Together, grants and rebates so far account for nearly 900 buses — some yet to be purchased or enter service. The funds generally cover a significant portion of the costs for vehicles and infrastructure, with the balance paid from local sources.

Cleaner buses offer many benefits

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has consistently supported clean power for Michigan’s nearly 17,000 buses transporting more than 800,000 students a year.

“The commitment by state and federal governments to provide schools with more environmentally friendly buses is good for our children, good for our schools and good for our communities,” EGLE Director Phil Roos said in the announcement. “Under Governor Whitmer's leadership, we are investing in clean-powered school buses, improving air quality and freeing up schools to invest in the classroom, and advancing the goals of the MI Healthy Climate Plan. These efforts are accelerating Michigan’s transition to a prosperous, healthy, equitable, clean energy future.”

Cleaner school buses offer many benefits, according to the EPA. With no or low emissions compared to diesel engines, they result in cleaner air on buses, in bus loading areas and in the communities where they operate. Diesel exhaust can lower air quality and impact the environment and human health, especially for children who have a faster breathing rate than adults and whose lungs are not yet fully developed.

The new grants are Round 3 of the Clean Bus Energy Grant program, which to date has awarded more than $81 million to Michigan schools for buses and associated infrastructure.

Applications for a final Clean Bus Energy Grant round of up to approximately $44 million are due Dec. 18.

Schools are working together

As part of the transition to clean buses, school districts across Michigan and nationwide are sharing solutions and working through challenges together. Groups such as the Michigan electric school bus coalition It’s Electric! advocate for school districts and support regular meetings with school transportation staff.

“We have enjoyed supporting school districts as they receive funds to transition their fleets from older, dirtier diesel buses to cleaner, quieter, newer models. This is a win for schools, kids, drivers, mechanics and the surrounding community,” Kindra Weid, It’s Electric! coalition coordinator, said in the announcement. “We know change comes with challenges, but these buses are worth the effort, and school districts across Michigan are experiencing lower maintenance costs, quieter rides and improved air quality as a result of their efforts pioneering new technology.”

Katrina Morris is executive director of the advocacy group Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation.

“Safety on the school bus is my top priority,” Morris said in the announcement. “I want all kids to have a safe ride to and from school, so cleaner air for the kids, drivers and the greater community is a victory. We are grateful for MDE and EGLE for supporting this transition to cleaner school buses.”

Kotek’s executive order authorizes nine natural resource agencies to adopt emergency rules and take other necessary actions to expedite solar and wind energy development.
But Kotek’s executive order has also caught the attention of critics who are counting on the new federal deadlines to help them run out the clock and defeat certain projects.
But the farmland preservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon doesn’t consider it likely that Kotek’s executive order will undermine land use protections, said Jim Johnson, its working lands policy director.
However, those waivers would not exempt projects from the state’s energy facility siting standards.","Renewable energy advocates hope a new directive from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek will allow such projects to beat pending federal deadlines to receive government subsidies.

Kotek’s executive order authorizes nine natural resource agencies to adopt emergency rules and take other necessary actions to expedite solar and wind energy development.

It also contains a series of instructions specifically directed at the Energy Facility Siting Council to help accomplish that goal, including foregoing federal consultations if possible and contracting with third parties to process applications, and directs the Public Utility Commission to take steps that would shorten the timeline for connecting clean energy to the power grid, among other measures.

With how much is at stake for energy reliability and economic development, the order is likely to meaningfully hasten the permitting process, said Angela Crowley-Koch, executive director of the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries Association.

“I think the governor was pretty clear in her directive to agencies to do everything under their existing authority to straight-line processes and siting, and I think they’ll do that,” she said.

But Kotek’s executive order has also caught the attention of critics who are counting on the new federal deadlines to help them run out the clock and defeat certain projects.

Projects that would convert large amounts of farmland have proven particularly contentious, with neighbors often organizing to impede regulatory approvals.

While state agencies can shorten some aspects of the permitting process, the question is whether controversial proposals will be able to clear other time-consuming barriers before federal tax credits expire.

For example, the Muddy Creek Energy Park — a solar facility planned on 1,600 acres of farmland in Linn County — must still likely undergo studies on sensitive species and wetland impacts, said Troy Jones, a neighbor who opposes the project.

“That’s a big hurdle for them to get past,” Jones said. “I don’t believe, legally, they can get anything expedited in this particular project. I’d be very surprised if they were able to facilitate this project to be accelerated.”

To qualify for federal tax credits worth 30% of project expenses, construction on renewable energy facilities must begin by mid-2026 and finish by 2030. Those that can’t start by then must be completed by the end of 2027.

Those deadlines will arrive up to five years sooner than developers originally expected due to provisions included in the Trump administration’s “One Bill Beautiful Bill” earlier this year.

Without substantial subsidies, some projects may not be financially feasible unless they can surmount bureaucratic obstacles to begin building ahead of schedule.

“I don’t believe that it pencils out without our tax dollars going to offset those costs,” Jones said of the Muddy Creek Energy Park.

It’s also doubtful that Kotek’s directive will allow the project to bypass legally mandated regulatory requirements, he said. “I don’t believe the state will take those steps, even with the executive order in place.”

Connie Lee, an opponent of the Deschutes Solar and Battery Energy Storage System Facility in Wasco County, is likewise skeptical the executive order will allow the facility to qualify for tax credits, short of waiving key requirements.

“I think it’s going to be more difficult than they anticipated,” Lee said.

The 13,600-acre facility is planned mostly in an “exclusive farm use” zone, including irrigated property of higher agricultural value, and contains wildlife habitat in which disruptions must be mitigated, Lee said.

“I don’t see how it could speed up their process at all if they still have to follow all the same rules,” she said. “It just is a very complicated process. Unless they’re going to just say, ‘We’re not going to mitigate for habitat. We’re not going to make sure that all these studies are done and examined,’ I don’t see how they could speed it up much faster.”

And given the staggering cost of installing solar panels across more than 20 square miles, Lee said she has trouble understanding how the project could proceed without federal subsidies — particularly in light of expected delays in connecting it to transmission infrastructure.

“I don’t see how they could make money if they can’t tie into the grid and produce energy,” Lee said. “Without the tax credits, I don’t see how you could afford to do the project.”

Though the Oregon Solar and Storage Industries Association is optimistic the directive will streamline permitting procedures, it’s too early to discuss the specifics regarding siting, land use and other requirements, said Crowley-Koch.

“We’re excited to work with the agencies and the governor’s office and see what’s possible,” she said.

Due to the Trump administration’s aversion to consult on renewable energy projects, for instance, it may be possible to waive certain state rules that require federal involvement, she said.

“Unfortunately, those federal agency staff members are not picking up the phone anymore. They’re not answering emails,” Crowley-Koch said. “That’s become a real problem for projects that are trying to move along in the process.”

While renewable energy “has the potential to play a supporting role” in assuring access to affordable and reliable electricity, the Oregon Farm Bureau believes it must be developed “without compromising the viability of our agricultural lands,” said Ryan Krabill, the organization’s government affairs manager.

To that end, the Farm Bureau is concerned that Kotek’s executive order “could open the door to expedited permitting processes that have the potential to undermine long-established farmland protections,” he said.

The state government must ensure that any projects fast-tracked under the directive fully comply with the land use planning laws and avoid construction on productive farmland, Krabill said.

“Farmers must not be made to bear the unintended consequences of rushed decision-making,” he said.

But the farmland preservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon doesn’t consider it likely that Kotek’s executive order will undermine land use protections, said Jim Johnson, its working lands policy director.

“It doesn’t affect any of the approval criteria,” Johnson said. “There’s only so much that this can change, ultimately.”

The governor can’t unilaterally change the law, so any action that amounts to “super-siting” solar and other renewable energy projects on farmland would require legislative action, he said.

The directive is more likely to prompt regulators to move certain projects “up in the queue” for permitting, for example, or to conduct required wildlife analysis in a more timely manner, Johnson said.

“What it’s going to do is tell agencies to give these priority and to try to speed it up. It doesn’t change the law,” he said. “In fact, the legislature could only change the law.”

When asked for concrete examples of the directive’s practical effects, the governor’s office pointed to a provision in the executive order that calls for the state’s Energy Facility Siting Council to hold additional meetings to expedite permitting.

Under another provision, certain civil penalties could be waived for regulatory violations, as long as they’re limited to the “minimum disturbance necessary” for solar and wind projects to begin construction by the federal deadline.

However, those waivers would not exempt projects from the state’s energy facility siting standards.

The governor’s office is also compiling a list of eligible project that are likely to meet the executive order’s criteria, which should be finished later this month, said Anca Matica, its communications and policy advisor.

“The directive to agencies is that the highest priority should be given to projects that have secured power purchase interconnection agreements and can demonstrate the project will provide benefits to Oregon ratepayers,” she said.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/10/36293687776_91922114ba_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 14:03:49.407857

""This transition can generate significant local health benefits by delivering cleaner and more efficient heat for industrial settings.
Educational efforts, policies, and investments in more efficient industrial technologies will yield major benefits for American communities and American manufacturers.""","A new study from the American Lung Association revealed the potential cost and health savings if U.S. manufacturers replaced thousands of industrial boilers with heat pumps.

According to the report, summarized by Canary Media, a gradual transition to heat pumps would save Americans $1.1 trillion in public health costs and avoid 77,200 pollution-inflicted deaths from 2030 to 2050. The publication explained that heat pumps use electricity to transfer heat instead of relying on dirty energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which contribute to the heating of the planet and health-harming air pollution.

States with higher concentrations of people living near industrial pollution sources stand to benefit the most, according to the analysis. Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina were identified as the states with the biggest estimated health benefits, with $107 billion, $82 billion, and $68 billion in projected savings, respectively. Twenty-three other states would save at least $25 billion each.

But heat pumps aren't just a solution for industry. Homeowners can implement these systems in their homes, which can save them money on utility bills. Heating and cooling are responsible for 60% of household emissions, according to Rewiring America, which adds that heat pumps are two to three times more energy-efficient than most traditional heating systems that rely on dirty energy sources. For instance, Mitsubishi, one of several companies that offer home heat pump systems, states that its devices are between 160% and 390% more efficient than gas-powered furnaces.

One other benefit of switching to heat pumps — whether at the industrial or household level — is that it cuts planet-heating pollution. Plus, this equipment delivers both heating and cooling in one package, and some heat pump users say these devices even distribute the heat in a way that feels more comfortable.

""I noticed … how different the 'comfort' feels compared to a regular furnace,"" one Redditor wrote. ""It's not blasting hot air all at once, but more of a steady, even warmth. Took me a few days to get used to, but now I actually prefer it.""

While it may seem overwhelming to find the right system for you, Mitsubishi can connect you with trained professionals in its trusted network who will help you install an efficient heat pump system.

For The Verge’s exclusive tour of these secretive labs, I watch researchers peer at cell chemistries down to the atomistic level, using electron microscopes. Others work at a larger scale, all the way up to the Megashaker. Inside a cavernous hall, an enormous sliding test chamber envelops one of GM’s double-stacked, 205-kilowatt-hour battery packs — the type that powers hulking models like the Cadillac Escalade IQ.

The 2,900-pound pack is suspended in midair from a ceiling-mounted crane, bolted to a surrounding structure to mimic its connection to a moving vehicle. Like a lithium-soaked smoothie, the battery is hydraulically shaken in the atmospherically controlled chamber, simulating anything from potholes to low-speed collisions. With dozens of test chambers for individual cells, modules, or entire packs, GM can simulate 10 years and 250,000 miles of real-world battery use and abuse in about six months.

GM can simulate 10 years and 250,000 miles of real-world battery use and abuse in about six months

That real world has become especially abusive to EVs. Some consumers have grown ambivalent, in part due to stubbornly high prices. Pollution and fuel-economy rules face an anachronistic rollback, encouraging automakers to lean into fossil-fueled cars. In the latest indignity, the $7,500 federal clean-car credits, beloved by EV buyers and a wellspring of sales for GM and other automakers, have been choked off by the Trump administration. All that took a $1.6 billion toll on GM’s bottom line this week, in the form of a writedown on third-quarter earnings.

GM directly attributed that $1.6 billion loss to the Trump administration eliminating credits and loosening emissions rules. The dirty ripples from those moves will surely be more polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) cars on the roads, and fewer EVs, as GM and other automakers scale back production to match lowered expectations for consumer demand. For all their sleek new models and multibillion-dollar investments, GM and other automakers continue to lose money on the electric side of the business. And this was before all these new headwinds began to blow.

GM must somehow withstand these industry shake-ups and stresses. But even as it plays defense by shoring up its ICE business, GM plans to keep on the EV offensive. Inside its sprawling Technical Center, the classic midcentury campus designed by Eero Saarinen, GM brings a 21st-century weapon to light: lithium manganese rich batteries, or LMR.

Is LMR the real deal?

Some analysts and investors keep saying Detroit has little chance of competing with China on the global EV stage. GM executives and engineers beg to differ, even as the Trump administration kneecaps the top-down energy and manufacturing policies and government supports that China used to go from automotive also-ran to a dominant force in EVs and batteries.

GM says its affordable, more sustainable LMR batteries will decisively outperform China’s best lithium iron phosphate (LFP) specimens — currently the world’s favored low-cost solution. The company’s new cells should deliver one-third more driving range than LFP, at virtually identical cost. All things equal, that’s the difference between an EV that can cover 300 miles and one that can keep going for 100 miles more. Indeed, GM promises better than 400 miles of EPA-rated range from their largest SUVs and pickups when these batteries arrive in 2028. They’ll also save GM at least $6,000 per battery pack, versus today’s pricey high-nickel cells. That’s nearly enough, by itself, to offset the loss of those $7,500 credits and bring EVs closer toward elusive price parity with gasoline models.

GM plans to keep on the EV offensive

“This unlocks premium long-distance range at an affordable cost,” says Andy Oury, a lead GM battery engineer.

Kurt Kelty, who helped transform the global industry as Tesla’s battery cell development chief, says these cells — unlike solid-state chemistries — aren’t the usual battery clickbait, promising on the page yet perennially stuck in the lab. Talking with more than a dozen battery executives, engineers, researchers, and scientists, their confidence was palpable: These batteries, they say, are tested, proven, and ready for mass production. GM is spending $900 million to build a pair of sprawling new battery centers here, on top of more than $5 billion already invested in US battery operations.

Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, has spent a lifetime in the field. He was at Sony in 1991 when the company debuted its revolutionary Camcorder, the first video recorder with a lithium-ion battery. He spent 11 years guiding Tesla’s battery tech as roughly Employee No. 50 at Elon’s fledgling outfit, then worked on the anode side for Sila Nanotechnologies before coming to GM.

“I’ve kind of seen it all at this point,” Kelty tells me. “So when I say this a game-changer, well, I’ve seen a lot of technologies come and go. Or usually not come. They have an announcement, and then they disappear. That’s kind of the standard for the battery industry.”

Where batteries tend to be about incremental improvement — a superior coating here, a better copper foil there — Kelty says these prismatic LMR cells represent a serious step change. One without the usual tradeoffs.

“That’s why we’re excited about it,” he says. “You can typically get high energy but kill your life cycle, kill your cost, or whatever. But in this case, it’s a really balanced chemistry.”

These batteries could stage an end-run around China in another way, relying more on a US-based supply chain that’s just getting off the ground. Asked about China’s current dominance, Kelty says GM knows what it’s up against. In a bitter irony for American innovation and manufacturing, that Nobel-winning LFP tech was developed right here at the University of Texas. But as American companies dithered, China helped itself to the patented technology and built itself an LFP empire.

“They violated the IP for years and years, but they only sold within China, so it was never an issue,” Kelty says. “Now those patents have expired, so they don’t have any problems exporting [LFP].”

“So you’ve got to keep in mind who your competitors are. And by using LMR, we can now actually exceed their LFP performance, but give it a similar cost.”

A hot ticket in batteries

Oury says LMR has been around for a decade, but researchers couldn’t overcome issues with voltage that petered out over time. Accelerating its development five years ago, starting with coin-size cells, GM solved the durability issues and steadily worked its way up to a larger prismatic form factor — stacks of thin cells, roughly the size of a laptop case — that will go into vehicles.

“We got the confidence to scale up to larger designs,” Oury says.

Among North American automakers, GM placed early bets on building its own “high nickel” or “nickel rich” batteries. That NCM (for nickel-cobalt-manganese) chemistry is the most energy-dense and currently powers nearly every EV sold in America. The automaker initially struggled to build those pouch batteries at scale, bringing production of some EVs to a crawl. But now those bets are paying off, giving GM a potential edge against EV latecomers, including tariff-tossed import brands with no domestic EV or battery factories. GM is now producing more lithium-ion cells than any automaker in North America, in partnership with LG Energy Solution at plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

“So when I say this a game-changer, well, I’ve seen a lot of technologies come and go.”

Kelty says GM can produce those cells at lower cost than any domestic rival. Based in part on teardowns of roughly two dozen competitors’ packs here, Kelty says GM isn’t yet the lowest-cost producer at the pack level — but will reach that milestone with its next-generation EVs. For one, prismatic LMR packs will require 50 percent fewer parts.

High-nickel may be the long-distance champ, but it’s expensive, heavy on pricey nickel and cobalt. Cobalt is also ethically fraught, including sourcing from African mines where children perform hazardous work for meager wages. Those battery costs, roughly 30 percent of a typical vehicle’s cost, remain the number one factor in making EVs unaffordable for many Americans. It’s the reason Cadillac’s impressive Lyriq-V, the 615-horsepower SUV, starts at over $81,000. It’s why a Cadillac Escalade IQ costs $130,000, or a Chevy Silverado EV pickup starts at $75,000.

China’s answer was those LFP batteries, which sparked that nation’s EV revolution, especially for small budget models that dominate that market. Safe and durable, those batteries replaced cobalt and nickel with cheap, plentiful iron and phosphate. GM, Ford, and Stellantis are among Western automakers now looking to build their own LFPs. The tradeoff is mediocre driving range and performance. The newest “Blade” LFP battery from China’s BYD delivers roughly 350 watt-hours per liter of volume. That compares with more than 600 watt-hours for GM’s high-nickel batteries, or Tesla’s 4680 cylindrical cells.

LMR’s innovation finds a middle ground through a healthy dose of manganese, the abundant silver-gray transition metal. The cells sacrifice only modest range versus the most powerful high-nickel designs. But they could be vastly cheaper and whip LFP’s driving range or performance. Ford has announced its own breakthrough in LMR.

In this chemistry competition, the action here is mainly in the cathode. That’s the positive battery electrode that generates electricity for a car or smartphone, and accepts electrons in a chemical reaction as the battery discharges.

Today’s NCM batteries contain up to 85 percent nickel in those cathodes, 10 percent manganese, and 5 percent cobalt. LMR batteries flip that. Their cathodes contain up to 70 percent manganese, about 30 percent nickel, and 2 percent or less of cobalt.

“Manganese is dirt cheap, so at a raw materials level, it gives you that benefit to start with,” says Kushal Narayanaswamy, GM’s director of advanced battery cell engineering.

GM in the house

Cheaper materials are only a start. Analysts say some Chinese companies are bringing new cars or batteries to market in as little as two years. That unrivaled pace may be China’s biggest advantage, more than the technology onboard their EVs. GM says its in-house operations could cut the time it takes to bring new batteries to showrooms by a full year, at lower costs and with higher quality.

I meet Narayanaswamy at the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, a linchpin of GM’s DIY approach to batteries. It’s taking a page from the vertical integration that characterizes China’s BYD, the world’s largest maker of EVs and batteries. Here, GM is developing and testing its own chemistries — mixing black slurries, coating cathodes — without constant back and forth with outside suppliers that can slow projects to a crawl. The Wallace lab can now produce up to 100 cells a day, and has created 26 variants of LMR cells in three form factors. Next door, I see the Ancker-Johnson Battery Cell Development Center under construction. The 500,000-square-foot facility will house a small pilot assembly line for batteries, bridging the often daunting gap between labs and factory production.

The automaker has cut testing time for new batteries by 60 percent. Digital twins and virtual modeling simulate hundreds of real-world scenarios — from condensation in battery packs to catastrophic collisions — before GM builds a single physical cell or pack. The company has simulated more than 1.4 million miles of driving. Radu Theyyunni, global director of virtual electrification and powertrain, says the company’s physics-based models have logged 150 million hours of compute time, to optimize LMR from the atomistic level to full packs. That’s the equivalent of a single, powerful CPU running nonstop for 171 years.

An obvious question: If LMR is all that, why is GM messing around with LFP batteries at all, with plans for production in Tennessee? GM executives argue that LFP can still be the right fit for lower-cost, lower-range models. And LFP shows great potential for second-life uses in stationary energy storage.

Forget the cavalry — it’s up to automakers and consumers

With government credits gone kaput, GM has chosen to pick up those $7,500 tabs itself for now through subsidized lease deals, to keep EV sales from flatlining. That’s generous of GM, but another hit to its bottom line, on top of a tariff bill that could reach $5 billion by year end. Dealers are surely being asked to share the pain.

I ask Kelty if the end of credits is like tearing off the Band-Aid: painful, but ultimately necessary. The credits were never meant to last forever. Now automakers have nowhere to hide, no subsidies, and no excuses. Analysts say the move may separate EV contenders from pretenders. Only automakers who can deliver affordable, compelling EVs, at a profit, will compete or perhaps survive, including against China on the global stage.

“Would I prefer that had come later?” Kelty says of the precipitous end of credits. “Yes, I think we all would. But it forces us to go in the right direction. We’ve got to get our costs down.

“We did this at Tesla as well, to ignore all the incentives out there. You’ve got to be able to stand on your own. And that’s the way we’re looking at it here at GM.”

Kelty says EVs can already match ICE cars in total cost of ownership. But that hasn’t won over enough Americans who look at an EV and see only a higher monthly payment.

“So once you get the sticker price to be similar, then it’s game over for ICE in most applications. Because it’s a better experience when you’re driving an EV.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GMBatteries01-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-18 11:02:36.297411

‘Small Louisiana has always been able to punch above our weight and be able to deliver needs to the world and to the nation in ways that other states cannot, so I think it’s important that we think about the fact that we are going to be growing in ways that we never expected before. As we start to develop and grow a little bit more, we need to be focused on how we are going protect our resources and how we can be partners in protecting those resources,” said Davidson.

Davidson, appointed by Gov. Jeff Landry in September 2025, is overseeing a reorganization of the Department of Conservation and Energy aimed at reducing bureaucratic hurdles while also adapting to modern industrial technologies.

“We took the opportunity to eliminate some of the duplicative functions that we had in the department,” he said. “Now we have one permitting office – a permitting office that handles coastal use permits, oil and gas permits, carbon capture permits, and any other permits that we issue. The department now has an enforcement office, ready to enforce the laws on the books, and an Office of Energy that is being expanded to mirror the federal Office of Energy,” said Davidson.

Davidson said the Department of Conservation and Energy, formerly the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, has been “reactive” in the management of oil and gas and water resources for years, in part because of outdated statutes on the books since the early 1900s. Additionally, the department had not been restructured since 1976, Davidson noted.

“We’ve taken the steps as a Department of Conservation and Energy to work closely with Louisiana Economic Development to make sure that any new business they are recruiting to the state is communicated to us, and that we can identify those permits on the front end so that there’s no lag or no delay in delivering those projects to communities – projects like we see in Richland, Louisiana with Meta or like we see with other businesses that will be coming to the state,” said Davidson

“As we look forward to the development of new technologies – and permitting projects around the state – we want make sure that we’re working with the applicants to make sure they know that they need to get out and partner with the community,” Davidson said.

Davidson said the oil and gas industry would benefit from a lower severance tax. “We’ve taken that approach to make sure that we can bring in new developers and help out some of the existing developers that are looking for new plays throughout the state,” he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/31/531168ba-b335-453b-ab9f-ef8dab017a9f/68dd7abb9528f.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:11:49.451128

About 30 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, Virginia, workers have been building America’s largest offshore wind farm at a breakneck pace. The project will start feeding power to the grid by March — the most definitive start date provided by its developer yet.

“First power will occur in Q1 of next year,” Dominion Energy spokesperson Jeremy Slayton told Canary Media. ​“And we are still on schedule to complete by late 2026.”

In an August earnings call, Dominion Energy CEO Robert Blue provided a vague window of ​“early 2026” when asked when the 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, or CVOW, project would start generating renewable power for the energy-hungry state.

As of the end of September, Dominion had installed all 176 turbine foundations — ​“a big, important milestone,” per Slayton. That accomplishment involved pile-driving 98 foundations into the soft seabed during the five-month stretch when such work is permitted. Good weather helped the work move along quickly, as did the Atlantic Ocean’s unusually quiet hurricane season.

Speed is key when building wind projects under the eye of a president who has called turbines ​​“ugly” and ​​“terrible for tourism” — and who has followed up with attempts to dismantle the industry.

Had CVOW not finished foundation installation by the end of this month, turbine construction would have been delayed until next spring. Federal permitting restricts pile-driving to a May-through-October window to protect migrating North Atlantic right whales. Such a delay would have made CVOW more vulnerable to the wrath of the Trump administration, which has already issued stop-work orders to two offshore wind farms under construction.

But Slayton said the threat of President Donald Trump’s interference doesn’t concern him. CVOW is, after all, 1 of only 2 in-progress offshore wind projects that hasn’t been directly attacked by the president.

“Our project has enjoyed bipartisan support from the beginning,” he said, pointing to backing from some of the state’s leading Republicans, including Governor Glenn Youngkin and U.S. Representative Jen Kiggans.

Kiggans, who represents the politically moderate Virginia Beach area, brought her concerns about Trump’s escalating war on wind to the House floor last month, when Congress returned from recess. She called CVOW ​“important to Virginia,” and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, later told reporters that he relayed Kiggans’ message directly to Trump.

“I understand the priority for Virginians and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see,” Johnson told Politico​’s E&E News, in a comment that broke from an anti–offshore wind narrative that’s taken root among many of his fellow House Republicans.

The project is crucial for helping the state meet a deluge of new electricity demand, as Virginia is at the center of the nationwide boom in data-center construction. CVOW will provide a huge amount of carbon-free power to the state and Dominion, its largest utility — helping both keep pace with rising demand without having to burn more polluting fossil fuels.

Kiggans also tied the success of CVOW to the needs of Virginia’s military installations.

“I always speak about that project in light of the national security benefit and that benefit to Naval Air Station Oceana,” Kiggans said last month in an interview with WAVY, a Virginia news station, noting that a partnership with Dominion is ​“giving Naval Air Station Oceana a $500 million power grid upgrade.”

Dominion has already spent $6 billion on the monumental effort to build CVOW, which has been 12 years in the making. Almost $1 billion of that investment has flowed to the local economy, creating 802 full- and part-time jobs in the state’s Hampton Roads region, according to G.T. Hollett, Dominion Energy’s director of offshore wind.

CVOW’s benefits are being felt nationwide too.

“The project has already created 2,000 direct and indirect American jobs and generated $2 billion in economic activity, strengthening the nation’s manufacturing supply chains and our regional economy,” said Katharine Kollins, president of Southeastern Wind Coalition.

Now Dominion will turn to the final phase of construction: turbine installation. The work is made possible by Charybdis — the first U.S.-built, Jones Act–compliant wind-turbine installation vessel — which arrived in Virginia’s Portsmouth Marine Terminal last month.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dominionenergy.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-18 12:11:54.365170

If you're an auto investor who doesn't look fondly upon those developments, just wait a few minutes and it'll probably change, for better or worse. Here's the latest issue facing investors and the EV industry.

With the federal $7,500 tax credit ending with the month of September, automakers trying to move EV inventory are digging into their own pockets to drive demand. General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) had previously found an intriguing loophole to use their finance arms to place down payments on EVs with intentions to pass that along to the consumer later. But both quickly ended those programs after pressure from politicians claimed the workarounds were ""nefarious.""

China, the world's largest auto market, accounted for roughly two-thirds of global sales, or about 1.3 million vehicles. North America and Europe also posted record highs, according to Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester.

""China remains the dominant driver of global EV growth,"" Lester said, noting that September is typically the country's busiest month for car buying. This year, demand was boosted further by shoppers trying to use up regional trade-in subsidies before they expired.

In the United States, sales jumped as buyers rushed to take advantage of the US$7,500 federal EV tax credit before it ended in late September. Rho Motion said U.S. demand is expected to drop sharply in the final quarter of the year as both consumers and businesses lose access to those incentives, which have been central to recent growth.

Europe also set a new record, thanks to incentives in Germany and solid demand in the United Kingdom. Tesla's rollout of a lower-cost Model Y in Europe is expected to intensify competition in the coming months.

Reuss suggested that the cheaper ""family"" will use different underlying technology from GM EVs that came before.","The Chevy Bolt is back, better than ever and just as cheap as before it went on hiatus. But it's not the only affordable electric vehicle General Motors is cooking up.

During an interview for the Plugged-In Podcast, airing Friday, I asked GM President Mark Reuss about the ""family of Bolts"" he mentioned on stage at an investor event about a year ago. What can we expect those to be like?

“What comes after this, whether it’s called a Bolt or not, will be a family of things that is low priced,” he said. “And when I say family, they won’t be adopted. They’ll be in the same vein of size and price.”

So, the family members won't all be Bolts, but they will share its general price point and size. That is, they'll be compact electric vehicles that cost around $30,000. The launch-edition Bolt goes on sale for $29,990 early next year, and Reuss said the upcoming models would be ""around that price point, so plus or minus.""

The big question, then, is what kinds of EVs to expect. Understandably, GM is playing it close to the chest, as none of these vehicles have been officially announced. But Reuss did say broadly that they could slot into ""white spaces"" in the EV market.

“I also think there’s some white spaces in size, class, of forms—not only the Bolt that we just introduced but also some different things, for different people’s styled tastes,"" he said.

There's one glaring ""white space"" to me, and that's the compact electric pickup segment. Ford has seen great success with the Maverick, but there's no electric equivalent to that yet. Ford is working on a roughly $30,000 electric pickup, and Slate is getting ready to launch one in the mid-$20,000 ballpark.

It wouldn't be at all surprising if GM was considering the same thing, especially because hulking, expensive, big-battery trucks like the Silverado EV haven't exactly taken off in the marketplace. Plus, we know the automaker has at least toyed with the idea in its affordable EV design studio.

Otherwise, I'd bank on another Bolt-sized compact crossover. Chevy said the 2027 Bolt will be ""limited run,"" and GM will likely want another small SUV to fill in its place in the EV lineup below the roughly $36,000 Equinox EV. A small sedan or hatchback seems unlikely, since GM has largely exited that segment.

Earlier this year, GM said a mysterious ""next-gen affordable EV"" will be built at its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas City, where the Bolt is produced.

The new Bolt is a partially redesigned take on the latest version, packing a new 65 kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery pack, better charging and a new motor into the same general package. Reuss suggested that the cheaper ""family"" will use different underlying technology from GM EVs that came before. That could mean a wider adoption of LFP batteries, or something different like the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) cells it's working on to cut costs.

Ford, for its part, has developed a ground-up platform and manufacturing system designed to make its next-generation EVs cheaper to build. GM is trying to drive down production costs, too.

“I think it’s another opportunity for us to look at battery chemistry and form, and a different architecture underneath that can be even more efficient, and give people even more car for the money,"" Reuss said.

By bringing in stable, off-grid energy sources, the company builds more resilient data infrastructure while avoiding the risks of overloading public systems.","VoltaGrid joins forces with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to provide 2,300MW of ultra-low-emissions energy, backing the fast-growing power demands of AI data centres.

This deployment uses the natural gas network run by Energy Transfer to ensure a steady, reliable supply for Oracle’s expanding cloud infrastructure.

Nathan Ough, Chief Executive Officer of VoltaGrid, calls it more than a standard power agreement.

He says: “This is more than a power deal, it’s a collaboration with Oracle to engineer scalable solutions that dampen swings in AI power demand.”

Nathan adds that their platform offers ""grid-grade performance with ultra-fast response, zero reliance on battery storage and near-zero criteria air emissions"".

The infrastructure rests on VoltaGrid’s modular power system, developed in collaboration with industrial technology firms INNIO Jenbacher and ABB.

The system meets the highly variable power requirements of AI workloads while reducing the need for battery-based backup.

The design enables fast response to changing loads, aligning reliability with environmental standards.

Matching AI's power volatility with scalable solutions

AI data centres face uneven energy demand.

As AI models grow in size and complexity, the power load shifts depending on the computational tasks at hand.

These fluctuations present a challenge for infrastructure providers, who must deliver constant power despite the inconsistent nature of the workloads.

Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, explains: “AI workloads are uniquely power-intensive and highly variable, often creating swings in demand.”

He says the collaboration with VoltaGrid helps Oracle to create “innovations that dampen these swings, making AI’s power usage more stable, predictable and grid-friendly”.

Oracle aims to support its AI infrastructure with dependable power that scales up or down without delay.

VoltaGrid’s platform becomes part of OCI’s wider energy strategy, offering on-demand delivery that aligns with both performance goals and emissions compliance.

The system also reduces strain on local grids, freeing Oracle from full reliance on public infrastructure.

The modular design provides high-quality output with fast deployment and supports improved heat rejection, a critical factor in high-density computing environments.

Natural gas backbone and firm power delivery

The infrastructure receives fuel from Energy Transfer, a key US energy supplier with an extensive pipeline and storage network.

This access to firm natural gas supply allows VoltaGrid to maintain operational consistency, a necessity for enterprise-scale data centres dealing with complex AI workloads.

VoltaGrid’s use of hybrid power, balancing gas efficiency with environmental goals, fits into Oracle’s strategy of resilience through energy diversification.

The system avoids the volatility of pure renewables while keeping emissions low.

This approach reflects wider trends in data centre energy strategy.

As power needs rise, especially with growth in high-performance computing and AI, cloud providers look for energy models that guarantee uptime.

VoltaGrid’s offering supports those aims without pulling heavily from local grids.

The partnership sets up Oracle to maintain availability and performance across regions that face surging demand for electricity.

Earlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world’s largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process — adopting the regulations — during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.

Instead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.

The development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a “con job,” extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.

“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The Trump administration was quick to celebrate

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as “another huge win” for Trump.

“Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,” Rubio wrote on X. “Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Trump had urged countries to vote “No,” posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.

After vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that “geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.”

Nations falter in their efforts to save the planet

The decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.

The world’s biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” Regenvanu said. “But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.”

Shipping emissions grow

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Thomas Kazakos, the chamber’s secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

The regulations, or “Net-Zero Framework,” would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/18/US-blocks-a-global-fee-on-shipping-emissions-as-international-meeting-ends-without-new-regulations-scaled-e1760746838654.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:02:35.813440

""Biomass-based diesel is essential to America's farm security, now more than ever,"" Clean Fuels said in the letter.
Biomass-based diesel producers and soybean processors are already negotiating feedstock contracts, fuel production and offtake agreements, and investment decisions for 2026.
Supporting continued growth of U.S. biomass-based diesel is crucial right now to support American farmers and the agricultural economy.""","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- U.S. soybean farmers could lose between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion if the Trump administration does not completely reallocate biofuels gallons to small-refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, a biofuels group told Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in an Oct. 16, 2025, letter.

Clean Fuels Alliance America cited an analysis by World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services, that outlines the losses to soybean farmers based on how much volume from SREs is reallocated.

The EPA issued a supplemental proposal to the RFS volumes, asking for public input on a range of reallocation from zero to 100%.

According to the company's study, if the agency adopts a 50% reallocation in 2026 to 2027 490 million gallons of biomass-based diesel production would be lost, leading to $1.4 billion in lost soybean farm revenue and a $1.8 billion drop in the value of soybean products to soybean crushers.

Clean Fuels said in the letter to Zeldin that reallocating zero gallons of biofuels would be ""considerable worse.""

The analysis found it would lead to 1 billion gallons of lost biomass-based diesel production, $2.6 billion in lost soybean revenue to farms and a $4.9 billion drop in the value of soybean products to crushers.

""Biomass-based diesel is essential to America's farm security, now more than ever,"" Clean Fuels said in the letter.

""Domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown in the United States. With increased farm productivity, U.S. soybean growers are right now harvesting a projected 4.3 billion bushels of soybeans for the season worth $43 billion. And with more than $6 billion of investment, U.S. soybean processors are expected to crush a record 2.5 billion of those bushels next year.""

Clean Fuels said that in facing retaliatory trade measures from China and a growing global competition from Argentina and Brazil, ""America's farmers cannot afford to lose the value"" that U.S. biomass-based diesel brings.

""We acknowledge that the current government shutdown is impacting both the administration's ability to provide economic relief to America's farmers and EPA's goal of meeting the statutory deadlines for the RFS rule,"" the group told Zeldin.

""Nevertheless, America's farmers are facing extreme economic challenge

and making planting decisions for next season. Biomass-based diesel producers and soybean processors are already negotiating feedstock contracts, fuel production and offtake agreements, and investment decisions for 2026. Across the board, our industry needs the rulemaking to be published before the end of the year to provide necessary policy stability and market confidence.""

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs, said in a statement, ""Clean Fuels urges EPA to quickly finalize the robust, timely RFS volumes it proposed in June and ensure they are not eroded by small-refinery exemptions. U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown here. Supporting continued growth of U.S. biomass-based diesel is crucial right now to support American farmers and the agricultural economy.""

“You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs.
For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: engage people where they are, identify shared priorities, and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits.","Heather Reams, the president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), stepped onto the stage at Breckenridge’s Mountain Towns 2030 summit — a room full of progressives accustomed to negotiating with Republicans on climate policy. She faced an audience from Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado — areas that often depend on Republican-controlled legislatures to achieve local sustainability goals.

Reams suggested that the instinct of these communities shouldn’t be to lecture or shame. It should be to listen and find common ground. “Democrats can’t do it alone,” she said. “Republicans care deeply about their land. They hunt, they fish, they ski. They love the outdoors as much as anyone. So, of course, they care about clean air and water. The question is: How do we talk about it?”

A lifelong Republican, Reams has made it her mission to answer that question. CRES collaborates with GOP lawmakers to promote clean energy, arguing that the conservative case for renewables is grounded in innovation, competitiveness and energy independence — not ideology.

At the conference, she stressed that the key to climate progress isn’t confrontation, but compromise. One side might favor solar projects while the other insists on traditional fuel sources. By recognizing shared interests — for example, expanding solar energy while permitting additional natural gas pipelines or transmission lines — both sides can advance without ideological conflict. It’s not about surrender; it’s practical problem-solving.

Reams highlighted Sen. John Curtis of Utah, founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, as a conservative champion of the environment. He has argued that the GOP should help shape, not resist, climate policy, emphasizing that sound stewardship and strong markets go hand in hand. Not all conservatives are on board. Reams wryly notes Utah’s other senator, Mike Lee, who, as she puts it, “just pats me on the head” when renewables come up.

Polls suggest that finding common ground reflects more than strategy— it meets voter demand. Pew Research Center data from 2024 show that 72 percent of Americans — including 56% of Republicans under 40 — support expanding solar and wind energy. A Yale Climate Communications poll reinforces this enthusiasm, showing that clean energy incentives can generate local jobs and economic growth.

Beyond politics, Reams emphasized the economic benefits of renewables. Solar, wind, battery storage, advanced nuclear, and geothermal are increasingly cost-competitive. Emerging energy industries can create high-paying local jobs, keeping residents in their hometowns rather than forcing talent to cities. She believes free-market forces are increasingly backing the case for clean energy.

That resonates with Republican leaders, who tend to prioritize economic and local issues and often find that sustained dialogue is more effective than public confrontation. “Renewables are winning on price,” Reams said. “You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs. We can win this on free-market principles.”

Geography and lifestyle naturally align. Western Republicans often share goals with progressives for preserving air, water and open space — and honoring the outdoorsy lifestyle. Coastal communities have similar motivations, whether it’s a clean Chesapeake Bay or a healthy Tampa Bay. For Americans who hunt, ski or hike, the outdoors can be a shared starting point — even across party lines.

For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: engage people where they are, identify shared priorities, and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits. Extreme views will always exist, but the broad middle can drive policy forward. Pragmatic collaboration, not ideological purity, is the path to progress.

By turning shared values into practical policies — whether through permitting reform or renewable energy initiatives — communities can make net-zero goals achievable. The enemy isn’t political disagreement; it’s obstinacy. When both sides operate from common interests, compromise becomes not just possible but also the most effective way forward.

WFHB Environmental Correspondent Amelia Bucher explores the challenges, the stakes and the politics of Indiana’s energy future in her feature on the path to cleaner, more sustainable power.

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana is doing its part to bring forests back to life:

The Nature Conservancy has been restoring Green’s Bluff, a natural area in Owen County threatened by development, and just this month, they secured an additional 83 acres. This means forest protection for the Raccoon Creek area of the forest and more habitats preserved for migrating songbirds. Many plants and animals need large, connected forests to survive. Once a fragmented woodlands, more than 68,000 trees now grow at Greens Bluff, including hardwood species like red oak, white oak, and walnut trees. Beyond planting, the Nature Conservancy has also added trails and created pollinator habitat at the preserve, and continues to pursue additional acreage to further consolidate forest protection at the site. Located about 15 minutes outside Bloomington, visitors can enjoy a trip to Greens Bluff Nature Preserve for a hike, to go birding, or to simply enjoy the changing colors of fall.

Coral reef decline: Scientists say coral reefs have become the first major environmental system on Earth to pass a climate tipping point—a threshold where damage to the planet becomes self-perpetuating and potentially irreversible. This report from the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute reveals that coral reefs have crossed the boundary where warming causes widespread, cascading collapse.

Warming oceans trigger bleaching events, where heat stress causes coral to expel the colorful algae that sustains it. If the stress continues, the coral dies completely. The International Coral Reef Initiative reported in April that an estimated 84 percent of the world’s coral reefs were under heat stress—the most extensive and intense mass bleaching event ever recorded. Coral reefs support about a quarter of all marine life and provide livelihoods for roughly a billion people worldwide.

Current global temperatures, about 1.4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages, are now just a fractions of a degree away from the worst-case scenario in which the coral simply cannot survive. However, there is still opportunity to slow these trends. Experts emphasize that slowing global warming by rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels and shifting towards renewable energy is now essential to preserve remaining coral populations and prevent additional ecosystem collapses.

Here is more information on coral reefs. The planet just crossed its first climate tipping point. Coral reefs are now in irreversible decline due to ocean warming and acidification caused by climate change.

Without rapid climate action, experts warn that we’re on the brink of hitting other tipping points too, including the devastation of the Amazon rainforest, the collapse of vital ocean currents, and the loss of ice sheets.

The unfortunate fact is, world leaders are failing to act fast enough to avoid climate catastrophe. And some, including Donald Trump, are more focused on attacking climate science and ripping up all our climate progress to date.

That’s why COP30 — the world’s biggest climate talks — is an opportunity we can’t afford to miss. In less than a month, decision-makers will meet in Belém, Brazil, to shape the course of climate action for years to come. 350.org and our partners are demanding COP30 deliver:

A rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, with no new oil, gas, or coal projects.

Reparations from wealthy countries to communities on the frontlines of climate loss and damage.

Indigenous, traditional, and frontline leadership at COP.

This year’s COP couldn’t be held in a more significant place. Belém is known as the gateway to the Amazon — and climate change and deforestation are pushing the Amazon ecosystem to the point of no return.

Now that we’ve passed the first tipping point — the collapse of coral reefs — we’re hurtling toward the next: the dieback of the Amazon, which is a critical carbon sink and will do devastating harm to the 100 million people who depend on the forest. We can’t let that happen.

In a remarkable triumph for marine conservation, green sea turtles have been removed from the endangered species list!

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced the reclassification to “least concern” status last week, marking one of the most significant marine species recoveries in recent decades.

Green sea turtles had been hunted to near-extinction for their meat, eggs, and shells. But in the 1970s, the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned commercial harvest and international trade of these animals. While these policies have vastly improved the population decline, sea turtles remain threatened by human presence: Accidents and injuries by boats and fishing and illness due to ocean pollution, especially plastics. But action has been taken to protect and restore green turtle populations. Around the world, individuals and organizations have driven local beach protection efforts, international collaboration between countries, and fishery innovations like turtle-friendly nets.

Florida has led much of the protection efforts in the U.S. through organizations like the Sea Turtle Conservancy which works to protect and improve sea turtle nesting grounds, and the Turtle Hospital which specializes rescue, rehabilitation, and release of sea turtles. Efforts like these along coasts worldwide have brought the green turtle population back to a level that no longer presents as “endangered.” The green turtle’s comeback offers proof that international cooperation and persistent effort can reverse biodiversity loss and restore hope for other endangered species.

Our friends at Wild Birds Unlimited share with us on how to prevent window strikes and help save the song birds.

Here’s a harsh truth: colliding with windows can be fatal for birds. Even if they manage to fly away, they are not just “stunned,” birds are often seriously injured. Windows reflecting sky or greenery trick birds into thinking there’s a clear flight path, and juvenile birds (who are just figuring things out) are especially at risk.

Preventing window strikes is one way you can help Save the Song Birds. With a few thoughtful adjustments, you can help birds recognize your windows as barriers, not passageways.

Feeder Placement: Place bird feeding stations within three feet of the window or beyond ten feet. Within three feet, birds fleeing the feeder area will not have built up enough speed to injure themselves if they strike the window. Beyond ten feet, birds will have enough time to spot and avoid the window.

Visual Cues: Apply deterrents to your windows (such as screens or decals) to help birds see the barrier and give them a chance to take action before any harm is done.

Install a Window Feeder: Use a window feeder to make birds more aware of the glass and so you have a front-row seat to watch your feathered visitors.

One year after removing the last dam on the Klamath River in California and Oregon, ecosystems are improving!

You may recall one of our September EcoReports cited the Klamath River dam removal as one example of Indigenous communities guiding environmental practices. Well since the removal of the dam last year, scientists can now confirm that these waters and their fish populations, are returning to original numbers, exceeding expectations.

For over a century, dams on the Klamath River created reservoirs that acted as “heat batteries,” allowing water to absorb and retain excessive summer warmth, triggering harmful algal blooms that produce the toxin microcystin. Since removing the last dam from the Klamath River, water samples that previously showed 58% contamination with microcystin now show zero detectable levels in 82% of samples.

According to the Yurok Tribal Fisheries Department Director Barry McCovey Jr., “the progress that we’ve made in just one year is pretty incredible. It provides us with a lot of hope for the future.”

Local tribal fishermen report that fish are returning earlier and in larger, healthier sizes than they have in over a century. The progress demonstrates the power of removing barriers to ecological recovery and offers hope for restoring other damaged river systems.

The accelerating energy demand is a growing concern for Americans.
There is no denying that renewable energy is supporting our economy and local workforce.
As the founder of Ideal Energy, a veteran-owned and operated solar and storage company, I am also proud that the renewable energy industry hires veterans at a faster rate than other industries.
As energy demands continue to rise and the country seeks long-term solutions, Iowa can be the example.","Iowa, a place over three million Americans call home, is also home to some of the nation's first achievements. We're the first in the country to caucus for president, the first to lead the nation in corn production, and the first to generate more than 60% of our electricity from renewable energy.

When it comes to setting an example, Iowa leads the way, and now is our moment to do it again.

The accelerating energy demand is a growing concern for Americans. With Iowa's electricity needs expected to increase by 30-60 percent over the next 20 years, it's time for Iowa to set an example for how we will stay ahead of the demand.

There is no denying that renewable energy is supporting our economy and local workforce. In Iowa alone, the industry employs nearly 15,000 workers, keeping them in their communities.

By being home to the first college in the nation to offer a Wind Energy and Turbine Technology associate's degree – utilizing a turbine as a working laboratory – young Iowans can effectively transition from the classroom into well-paying jobs in a place they already call home.

As the founder of Ideal Energy, a veteran-owned and operated solar and storage company, I am also proud that the renewable energy industry hires veterans at a faster rate than other industries.

With 16-plus years of experience serving our communities in clean energy, and 12 years of service to our country overseas as both a U.S. Navy SEAL and independent contractor under the Department of State, I recognize that renewable energy is the cleanest and most efficient form of homegrown energy, which keeps us from relying on foreign adversaries for our energy needs.

It is our mission to educate Iowans about localized energy solutions that allow us to flourish independently and empower our communities.

Iowa farmers should feel emboldened to harvest the sun and participate in cashing in on Iowa's most valuable land uses. According to the USDA NASS Data, the production value of solar is estimated at $11,068 per acre. That's ten times more than any other viable crop in the state. This income could be a lifeline for Iowa's generational farmers.

It is also important to note that these utility-scale solar and wind leases are completely voluntary between the landowner and the developer and will never require the use of eminent domain. Just another reason why protecting property rights also means protecting a farmer's right to choose what they harvest on their land.

Iowa is a state that leads, not follows. As energy demands continue to rise and the country seeks long-term solutions, Iowa can be the example.

We are not only powering our own communities with renewable energy, but we are empowering an entire nation to follow our lead as we light the way to an independent and secure energy future.

It is possible to advance our environmental goals while keeping Illinois affordable, competitive, and reliable.
Illinois manufacturers are ready to help build a brighter energy future.
Mark Denzler is the president & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association.","Illinois manufacturers are the backbone of our state’s economy—employing more than 600,000 workers, supporting local communities, and producing the goods that power America. But none of that is possible without access to affordable, reliable, and resilient energy.

Over the last several weeks, the Illinois House and Senate have held additional hearings to address the state’s rising power demands, with the goal of advancing legislation during the fall veto session in October. Unfortunately, this renewed push for a sweeping energy bill does little to address flaws in a similar proposal unveiled during the spring, with major new costs that could soon hit the manufacturing sector and every Illinois family. While it’s true that Illinois must modernize its energy framework, this latest proposal misses the mark by prioritizing costly mandates over meaningful investment in the resources we truly need: increased generation and more robust transmission.

The manufacturing sector is one of the largest consumers of energy in Illinois. Without affordable and predictable rates, manufacturers cannot plan for growth, make long-term investments, or stay competitive in a global economy. The current proposal jeopardizes that stability.

While provisions such as investing in battery storage are useful, the current proposal is a multi-billion dollar plan that will add a brand-new cost on every single energy bill. The proposal falls short of sufficiently addressing the need for more power generation, particularly dispatchable baseload generation that keeps the lights on when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Illinois manufacturers rely on uninterrupted power to operate safely and efficiently. Yet we’re seeing growing concerns about grid reliability throughout Illinois following repeated warnings issued by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) about potential capacity shortfalls.

The impact of these warnings is not theoretical, with customers in downstate Illinois now feeling the strain of an estimated 20 percent increase in their electric bills. Looking north, the story is all too similar. Households in the service territory belonging to PJM, which serves Chicago and much of Northern Illinois, have already seen a $67.28 month-over-month increase to the average June 30 bill. What’s more, the capacity cost for electricity throughout PJM’s territory will climb another 22 percent beginning in June 2026 in accordance with the grid operator’s latest auction. These shortfalls and resulting price increases represent real risks to industrial operations, community investment, and economic development. Without a serious effort to both extend our current energy plants and increase generation capacity, we’re courting disaster.

Likewise, Illinois must invest in transmission infrastructure to deliver energy where and when it’s needed. Manufacturing isn’t confined to urban centers—it’s spread across the state, in both large cities and small towns. Without adequate transmission, adding new renewable or storage assets won’t help manufacturers if they can’t access that power. In addition to expanding generation, the focus of our state’s energy policy must center on developing a meaningful plan to streamline transmission development or address permitting bottlenecks.

Manufacturers are not opposed to clean energy. In fact, we’ve led the way on efficiency and emissions reduction. But any policy must be grounded in reality and avoid high-cost mandates that are missing well-defined guardrails, especially at a time when businesses and households can least afford these added burdens. It is possible to advance our environmental goals while keeping Illinois affordable, competitive, and reliable.

As lawmakers return to Springfield, they have a chance to reset and refocus and avoid the mistakes of the past.

Illinois manufacturers are ready to help build a brighter energy future. That means going back to the table, listening to stakeholders, and drafting policy that focuses on what really matters: reliable generation, strong transmission, and affordable rates.

In all, workers from nearly 50 companies across Maryland will benefit from vendor relationships with Sparrows Point Steel.
While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.
With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do.","The U.S. Department of Transportation showed an alarming disregard for the nation’s security a few weeks ago by clawing back a $47.3 million grant intended to launch a new era of steel production at Sparrows Point.

Members of our union, the United Steelworkers (USW), are profoundly disappointed by the Trump administration’s abandonment of a project primed to create jobs, boost manufacturing capacity and meet our country’s growing energy needs.

But it’s important to emphasize that the government’s turnabout represents only a setback, not the end of this forward-looking initiative.

The USW and our partner, US Wind, remain committed to bringing steel back to Baltimore and injecting new life into Sparrows Point. We’re confident that this site, once the home of the largest steel mill in the world, has yet another pivotal role to play in America’s future.

The USW and US Wind joined forces about four years ago. We intend to use a portion of the mill property to build monopiles — the huge foundations sunk into the seabed to support wind turbines — through a new company called Sparrows Point Steel.

Over the full scope of US Wind’s offshore projects, the company will consume more than 330,000 metric tons of steel plate, a huge boon to the steel industry. This is directly in line with the Trump administration’s stated goal of building more in America — and makes the administration’s cancellation of the grant all the more puzzling.

Current projections call for Sparrows Point Steel to employ more than 500 USW members in production, maintenance and a variety of other roles. We’re talking about good-paying, middle-class jobs that enable workers to support their families and lift up the entire community.

Our commitment to building out the wind energy supply chain means sourcing not only our steel plate but many other kinds of materials and supplies from domestic producers. In all, workers from nearly 50 companies across Maryland will benefit from vendor relationships with Sparrows Point Steel.

On top of that, US Wind intends to establish an operations and maintenance center at the harbor in West Ocean City. This facility will coordinate turbine and substation maintenance for offshore wind developments, creating still more jobs in the manufacturing, maritime and energy sectors.

But there’s more. While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.

Our work will help to position America as the leader in a global, evolving industry. It will also help to deliver a more reliable energy supply at a time of growing demand and more frequent disruptions in the power grid resulting from climate change.

Marylanders get this.

A recent poll found that seven out of 10 respondents support the construction of wind projects off the Maryland coast because of their potential to stabilize energy prices, enhance the nation’s energy supply and reduce pollution.

The respondents’ support cut across political lines, underscoring the high stakes. What’s more, 81% opposed the reversal of offshore wind projects already underway out of concern for job losses, according to the survey, conducted by Turn Forward, a nonprofit supporting wind energy.

Sparrows Point is hallowed ground for the USW.

At one time, tens of thousands of union members worked here, producing the steel that built the middle class, fueled prosperity and made America a superpower.

We now have an opportunity to build on that legacy — to harness manufacturing and energy for a stronger future.

With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do. Alongside our partners at US Wind, we’ll get the job done.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210803_104844-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 06:59:48.917937

The senator said taking advantage of an evolving energy industry is a way to help the state's economy grow its population.","U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy on Thursday offered a full-throated defense of President Donald Trump’s energy policies, saying the administration seeks to foster the development of new clean energy technologies without forcing taxpayers to subsidize industries that aren’t ready to stand on their own.

Cassidy, a Republican facing a tough reelection battle next year, said Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, puts sensible limits on clean energy subsidies while supporting advances in carbon capture and storage, high-tech fuels and other energy innovation.

“The Biden administration created overly generous subsidies for industries that would lower the carbon footprint,” Cassidy said in an interview in New Orleans during a break at the Louisiana Energy Security Summit. “President Trump and the Republican Congress said this can't just be a money grab for industry. It has to be something that gets you on your feet, and then you become commercially viable.”

He added that the president’s efforts to reopen shuttered nuclear power plants also will create more carbon-free energy to fuel domestic demand driven by the advent of power-hungry AI data centers.

Thursday's energy summit was hosted by the American Council for Capital Formation, a pro-business think tank that advocates for free market policies.

More than 250 energy industry executives gathered for presentations and networking at the Higgins Hotel in the Warehouse District. Cassidy provided opening and closing remarks, bookending presentations about China’s threat to America’s energy production and supply chain, manufacturing momentum in Louisiana, and how the state’s oil and gas industry strengthens U.S. leadership.

Cassidy's comments defending Trump come three months after passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act enshrined into law dramatic changes to the nation's energy policy, which emphasizes increased domestic oil and gas production at the expense of cleaner and renewable energy sources.

Trump's bill slashed Biden-era tax breaks designed to boost wind and solar power, threatening billions in investments in Louisiana and, critics have said, slowing the state's efforts to grow its clean energy industry at a time when greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change.

Currently, Louisiana has more than a dozen utility-scale solar farms. Though there aren't any land-based wind farms in the state yet, at least five utility-scale wind projects are in development..

The administration has kept in place some tax breaks for hydrogen, battery storage and nuclear plants protects.

Evolving energy industry

Cassidy is gearing up for a 2026 U.S. Senate race that has attracted several competitors who believe the state's senior senator is vulnerable because of his 2021 vote to convict Trump during a second impeachment trial. The race will be Louisiana's first closed primary in decades.

Among Cassidy's challengers are state Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of Lafayette, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta and St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden. All are highlighting their devotion to Trump.

During the interview, Cassidy said Louisiana needs more jobs, better protection from extreme weather, cheaper insurance and better schools to keep up with neighboring Southern states.

“The bayou regions have lost population because, after Ida, the cost of housing went up, families felt insecure and they moved out, so we've got to make our state more secure from things like hurricanes and flooding,” Cassidy said, citing the 18.5-mile, nearly $4 billion hurricane protection system that will stretch from the Bonnet Carre Spillway to Garyville as an important step in the right direction.

Cassidy also highlighted a bill he co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, that he said would help build domestic energy production of all types. The latest version of the bill, introduced in April, would place a fee on high-pollution imports from international competitors. It is under review by a Senate committee.

The senator said taking advantage of an evolving energy industry is a way to help the state's economy grow its population.

“Louisiana has a real opportunity, but it's not like that couldn't be squandered,"" he said.

Bill Cassidy on Thursday offered a full-throated defense of President Donald Trump’s energy policies, saying the administration seeks to foster the development of new clean energy technologies without forcing taxpayers to subsidize industries that aren’t ready to stand on their own.

Cassidy, a Republican facing a tough reelection battle next year, said Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, puts sensible limits on clean energy subsidies while supporting advances in carbon capture and storage, high-tech fuels and other energy innovation.

“The Biden administration created overly generous subsidies for industries that would lower the carbon footprint,” Cassidy said in an interview in New Orleans during a break at the Louisiana Energy Security Summit. “President Trump and the Republican Congress said this can't just be a money grab for industry. It has to be something that gets you on your feet, and then you become commercially viable.”

He added that the president’s efforts to reopen shuttered nuclear power plants also will create more carbon-free energy to fuel domestic demand driven by the advent of power-hungry AI data centers.

Thursday's energy summit was hosted by the American Council for Capital Formation, a pro-business think tank that advocates for free market policies.

More than 250 energy industry executives gathered for presentations and networking at the Higgins Hotel in the Warehouse District. Cassidy provided opening and closing remarks, bookending presentations about China’s threat to America’s energy production and supply chain, manufacturing momentum in Louisiana, and how the state’s oil and gas industry strengthens U.S. leadership.

Cassidy's comments defending Trump come three months after passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act enshrined into law dramatic changes to the nation's energy policy, which emphasizes increased domestic oil and gas production at the expense of cleaner and renewable energy sources.

Trump's bill slashed Biden-era tax breaks designed to boost wind and solar power, threatening billions in investments in Louisiana and, critics have said, slowing the state's efforts to grow its clean energy industry at a time when greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change.

Currently, Louisiana has more than a dozen utility-scale solar farms. Though there aren't any land-based wind farms in the state yet, at least five utility-scale wind projects are in development..

The administration has kept in place some tax breaks for hydrogen, battery storage and nuclear plants protects.

Evolving energy industry

Cassidy is gearing up for a 2026 U.S. Senate race that has attracted several competitors who believe the state's senior senator is vulnerable because of his 2021 vote to convict Trump during a second impeachment trial. The race will be Louisiana's first closed primary in decades.

Among Cassidy's challengers are state Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of Lafayette, Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta and St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden. All are highlighting their devotion to Trump.

During the interview, Cassidy said Louisiana needs more jobs, better protection from extreme weather, cheaper insurance and better schools to keep up with neighboring Southern states.

“The bayou regions have lost population because, after Ida, the cost of housing went up, families felt insecure and they moved out, so we've got to make our state more secure from things like hurricanes and flooding,” Cassidy said, citing the 18.5-mile, nearly $4 billion hurricane protection system that will stretch from the Bonnet Carre Spillway to Garyville as an important step in the right direction.

Cassidy also highlighted a bill he co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, that he said would help build domestic energy production of all types. The latest version of the bill, introduced in April, would place a fee on high-pollution imports from international competitors. It is under review by a Senate committee.

The senator said taking advantage of an evolving energy industry is a way to help the state's economy grow its population.

The package emphasizes building on existing rights-of-way in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to increase capacity and relieve congestion without cutting through new swaths of land.

The financing was in its closing stages toward the end of the previous administration and had been under review as part of a broader re-evaluation of energy grants and loans. If allowed to go forward, it sends a pragmatic carve-out message: projects that provide close-at-hand reliability benefits and involve largely low-conflict upgrades that can move faster seem to be okayed.

AEP, one of the nation’s largest transmission owners, believes the effort involves about 13% of its network. The loan guarantee, issued by DOE’s Loan Programs Office (renamed in the Trump era as Energy Dominance Financing Program), lets the utility access lower-cost financing. DOE officials say the more favorable terms will save the company a minimum of $275 million, with ratepayers due for some benefit.

A Loan Guarantee With Swift Grid Impact and Savings

Reconductoring is a quick and cost-effective method to add throughput on the existing towers by swapping out the old wires for new conductors—advanced versions like high-temperature, low-sag designs that can safely move more electricity along the same corridor. It sidesteps the protracted siting battles and environmental reviews that come with new lines, which is a significant advantage in places where public opposition or permitting delays can slow projects for years.

Industry analyses underscore the payoff. The Brattle Group and other grid consultants have found that technologies like reconductoring and its cousin grid-enhancing tech can, in many cases, boost the transfer capacity of expensive lines by double digits, as well as deliver benefits in months or years instead of a decade after they are first installed. Though this AEP package focuses on new wires, similar projects that add so-called dynamic line rating devices—sensors that change the capacity in real time by considering weather—have delivered considerable congestion relief at a low cost.

The stakes are high. Transmission congestion costs across organized markets—now totaling less than $20 billion in recent years—are leading to higher customer bills, and low-cost wind and solar have been curtailed. AEP’s footprint lies at the borders of the PJM, MISO, and SPP markets where you’re especially likely to see transmission constraints manifested through differences in wholesale price spreads.

Why This Program Withstood Administration Scrutiny

The administration has sought to roll back a number of transition-period awards, such as one totaling $467 million in Minnesota aimed at unlocking 28 gigawatts of new generation—predominantly wind and solar—and $250 million in Oregon to connect a slate of renewable projects. It has also singled out a $630 million grant in California’s grid modernization bid to build that state’s grid with advanced conductors and dynamic line ratings, both designed to pull more capacity from existing energy corridors.

So why spare the AEP loan? Three reasons stand out. First, reliability: the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has issued multiple alerts of high risks on the Midwest-Plains grid under peak conditions. Second is customer economics: the guarantee is meant to pass savings on to bills by cutting borrowing costs. Third, fiscal optics: A loan guarantee—the Loan Programs Office has averaged about a 3 percent loss rate historically—is easier to justify favorably than is a direct grant, especially in cases where upgrades have no new routes or eminent domain.

The political math, too, is stacked in favor of incremental victories. Reconductoring provides tangible capacity gains without the years-long controversy that often plagues long-distance lines, and is a neat middle way between doing nothing or undertaking big headline-grabbing build-outs.

Implications For Rates Reliability And Renewables

Power prices in the project area already have a tendency to fall below the national average, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Still, customers are experiencing the sting from congestion charges and reliability must-run costs when the grid is tight. More production capacity can back up peak demand, stabilize price spikes, and attenuate the constriction of wind and solar production in resource-rich areas.

Speed matters. Reconductored projects can be planned and built on a time scale of quarters rather than years, whereas large greenfield transmission lines often require the better part of a decade to get permitted and constructed. That pace of progress jibes with warnings from grid operators and reliability planners that capacity additions and load growth—driven by data centers, electrification and reshoring of industry—are outstripping today’s transmission capacity.

The move is also consistent with continuing federal rulemakings. Recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders seek to promote better long-term transmission planning and clarify backstop siting authority. Near-term upgrades like AEP’s can help narrow the gap while wider reforms take hold.

A Narrow but Prominent Policy Signal on Transmission

This doesn’t mean an acceptance in full of its predecessor’s grid agenda, not least because larger grants are on the chopping block. But it does indicate that the administration is open to backing targeted, low-friction efforts promising reliability and bill savings, even if they are limited in scope.

For both utilities and developers, the message is clear: incremental capacity expansions using existing corridors with consumer benefits are the most likely to get federal support. Whether it extends to meatier, multi-state transmission projects will determine how soon the U.S. can tamp down on congestion, integrate new generation and accommodate growing demand while keeping costs in control.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image_1760740709_1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 13:02:07.078320

The solar program is a Biden administration initiative intended to help low-income families access renewable energy, something President Donald Trump has categorized as expensive and unreliable.

Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Solar for All program was established by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the program’s cancellation in August, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law in July, which he said eliminated the program’s funding source.

The cancellation puts federal grants to 60 state, local and tribal governments in question, NBC News reported. The program was designed to provide solar panels and battery storage to approximately 900,000 low-income households across the country. Recipients had already begun planning projects based on expected funding.

What’s at stake for states?

California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced two separate lawsuits on behalf of states that received Solar for All grants. One complaint seeks monetary damages and was filed in the Court of Federal Claims. A second suit asking for reinstatement of the program is expected in federal court in Washington state.

Bonta called the EPA’s decision an “illegal termination,” adding that the Trump administration “can try all they want to bend the law, but we will hold them accountable. Every time.”

California stands to lose about $250 million in approved funding. Arizona would forfeit $156 million that was slated to benefit 11,000 low-income households, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in Reuters. Mayes said those families could see energy bills jump by 20% without the assistance.

Why did the administration cancel the program?

The Trump administration has consistently opposed federal subsidies for renewable energy projects. Zeldin called Solar for All a “boondoggle” when announcing its termination.

Trump has characterized solar and wind power as expensive, unreliable and unworthy of government backing, as opposed to gas, coal and nuclear, which have received strong support. His administration has rolled back multiple clean energy initiatives that were established under previous leadership.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act provided the legal mechanism to eliminate Solar for All’s funding stream. That law was part of broader efforts to reduce government spending and refocus energy policy away from renewable sources.

What are the other lawsuits over Solar for All?

The states’ Thursday filing joins earlier legal actions from other affected parties.

On Oct. 6, a coalition filed suit in federal court in Rhode Island, The New York Times reported. The lead plaintiff was the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, representing labor unions that had trained workers to install solar panels. The unions were counting on work from a $49.3 million grant to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.

The vexing question hung last week over the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) sustainability conference, the first of its kind for the nonprofit representing America’s solar industry.

According to the International Energy Agency, up to 78 million tons of solar panels are expected to retire around the world by 2050, the largest waste stream of any clean-energy technology in history. Dubbed the “solar waste tsunami,” the wave of these retirements is projected to accelerate through the 2030s and 2040s as the first generation of large-scale solar farms reaches the end of its life.

To get ahead of this looming waste crisis, the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2023 that it would craft a new rule to reclassify retired solar panels as “universal waste,” a category for materials that need specialized handling, like batteries, pesticides and mercury-containing devices.

“This change in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulations, once finalized,” should benefit the wide variety of establishments generating and managing solar panel waste by providing a clear, practical system for handling discarded solar panels,” the EPA said.

The rulemaking was supposed to begin in June 2025 and be completed by December 2026, according to the EPA’s policymaking timetable in the Federal Registry.

“They were supposed to come out with this proposed rulemaking in June of this year, but we didn’t see that yet,” Anna Weitz, a clean energy engineer with the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, said during a panel discussion on national and local policy on solar panel decommissioning. The technology center tracks policies on solar panel waste.

Asked for comment, the EPA said in an email that it has revised its rulemaking calendar to start in February 2026 and finish by August 2027.

The delay leaves the U.S. without a federal framework for managing millions of tons of panels nearing the end of their 25- to 30-year lifespans.

To understand why solar panel decommissioning and recycling matters and how it works requires knowledge of the materials involved. A solar panel is mostly glass (about 70 to 80 percent), with 10 percent aluminum, 10 percent polymers and a small but valuable mix of silver, copper, tin and lead. To recycle them, those layers have to be painstakingly separated.

Decommissioning is the process of dismantling and disposing of panels that have reached the end of their lives and ensuring the sites they occupied are left safe and stable. Ideally, recycling is part of that process, allowing valuable materials inside the panels to be recovered rather than discarded.

Glass can be reused for new panels or bottles. Silver and copper can be melted down and sold. But lead and other heavy metals are toxic, requiring careful extraction and disposal to prevent leaching into soil or groundwater.

“Solar panels aren’t just an installation, where you leave them and forget them. We have end-of-life solutions that are responsible, that are well thought out, that are … a very attractive business,” said Adam Sokolski, the policy director at EDF Renewables North America, the clean energy subsidiary of the France-owned utility giant.

So far, 35 states have adopted some form of solar decommissioning or waste policy, according to a tracker managed by the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center. Of them, less than 10 have policies to recycle the retiring panels.

The remaining 15 states, including solar powerhouses Florida and Arizona, still have no statewide rules for retiring of panels. In those places, unless local governments act, most retired panels end up in landfills, where their valuable metals are lost and their toxins can leach into the environment.

New Jersey is one of the few states where both state and local governments oversee solar projects. Its Right to Farm Act requires that projects on farmland include decommissioning as part of their conservation plans, filed with the local soil conservation district. In the Pinelands reserve, developers must add a similar plan to their landscaping proposal. The state doesn’t require funds to be set aside for cleanup, but local governments may.

The demand to properly recycle or dispose of these expired panels has led to a nascent but growing industry of solar panel recyclers, mostly third-party companies that solar companies contract to handle the recycling and disposal process. Many of the recyclers gathered here at the solar industries conference, wanting consistent guidance on how to do their jobs.

Without federal regulations, states have been forced to go their own way, with recyclers following “inconsistent” rules, said Weitz.

“The goal of policy is to establish a level of certainty,” said Connor Hogan, chief financial officer of solar recycling company OnePlanet.

To create stable demand, many of these recyclers want states and local governments to pass a baseline policy of enforcing landfill bans, which would forbid developers from throwing expired solar panels away and instead seek out recycling firms.

A solar decommissioning policy widely panned by the industry was Washington State’s 2017 Photovoltaic Module Stewardship and Takeback Program, which required manufacturers to submit a “stewardship plan” detailing how they would finance and manage the collection and recycling of solar panels sold in the state or risk being barred from the market.

The rule drew strong backlash from the solar industry, which argued the requirements were unclear, burdensome and premature given the lack of recycling infrastructure. The state senate amended the law to delay enforcement to 2030.

Only California and Hawaii have formally reclassified solar panels as universal waste, giving them a clear path for collection and recycling.

For communities, particularly those near large solar farms or waste sites, the absence of federal standards means less oversight of where panels go once decommissioned, raising environmental justice concerns over toxic exposure and missed economic opportunities like job creation from recycling.

The Trump administration has shown little appetite for advancing new federal rules on solar-panel waste; instead, its broader environmental agenda has focused on deregulation, rolling back climate mandates and cutting support for clean energy programs.

In the European Union, solar panels fall under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment or the WEEE Directive, which makes manufacturers financially responsible for collecting and recycling panels. Since 2018, EU member states were required to recover 85 percent and recycle 80 percent of panels. Untreated panels are banned from landfills.

Industry-led groups like PV Cycle manage takeback systems across Europe, making the EU the world’s most advanced region in solar panel waste regulation.

Zooming out, solar waste is still dwarfed by waste from coal and fossil fuel energy. A Nature Physics paper called solar panel waste “a drop in the ocean” compared to the vast quantities of coal ash, mine tailings and billions of gallons of toxic produced water generated by fossil fuel industries. According to the paper’s estimate, cumulative solar panel waste through 2050 will reach between 54 million and 160 million metric tons, while coal ash alone would be 300 to 800 times greater and oily sludge from crude oil 2 to 5 times larger.

“In fact, we globally produce and manage approximately the same mass of coal ash per month as the amount of [solar panel] module waste we expect to produce over the next 35 years,” the paper’s authors said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SolarDismantling-1024x530.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 05:58:59.968213

This announcement marks a pivotal moment in the race to develop alternatives to lithium-ion technology that are lower cost, less dependent on critical materials, and suited to local manufacturing.

What the Scientists Have Achieved

Ultra-fast Charging & High Energy Density

The prototype sodium-ion pouch cells engineered by the RISE team boast an energy density of ~180 Wh/kg and volumetric energy of ~ 550 Wh/L

These figures allow them to exceed or rival many lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries currently used in EVs and energy storage

The battery delivers a power output of ~10 kW/kg and maintains ~97 percent capacity across many cycles

Materials & Design Advantages

Importantly, the design uses no cobalt, nickel, copper or lithium — instead relying on more abundant, non-toxic materials

The scientists mention they developed a proprietary electrode design and electrolyte formulation to support fast ion transport and structural stability even under rapid charging

The battery is engineered to remain thermally stable and to function across extreme temperatures — a critical requirement for real world use in India and similar climates

Why This Is Important

Reducing Dependence on Critical Imports

Lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper are subject to supply constraints, geopolitical risk, and high costs. By contrast, sodium is abundant, inexpensive, and available within India. This innovation supports the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) vision by reducing reliance on imported critical minerals

Lower Cost & Safer Chemistry

Sodium-ion batteries are inherently more tolerant to abuse, less prone to thermal runaway, and often safer in design. Coupled with lower raw material costs, they could become a competitive alternative to lithium-ion systems, particularly in large scale energy storage and mid-range electric vehicles.

Applications from EVs to Grid Storage

With rapid charging, high power, and robust cycle life, these batteries hold promise for sectors including:

Electric vehicles (2-, 3-, and 4-wheelers)

Renewable energy storage (solar, wind integration)

Microgrids and rural electrification

Backup power systems and heavy machinery

Strategic & Global Impact

If commercialized and scaled, this technology could shift competitive balance in battery manufacturing. India could emerge as a leader in low-cost battery tech, reducing the dominance of established players in China, South Korea, or other major battery producing nations.

Challenges & the Road Ahead

While the announcement is exciting, there remain key challenges and uncertainties before commercialization:

The researchers estimate that commercial applications could be feasible within 2–3 years, depending on development of local supply chains and further scale-up

Context: Sodium-Ion Battery Research Globally

Sodium-ion (Na-ion) battery technology has long been studied as a lower-cost alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion). The main tradeoffs historically have been lower energy density and slower charging. Researchers worldwide have experimented with novel cathodes (e.g., NASICON, Prussian blue analogs), engineered electrolytes, and nanostructured electrodes to overcome these challenges

In India, earlier work reported a sodium-ion battery that could charge up to 80% in ~6 minutes using a NASICON-type cathode/anode structure, but that design did not reach the same energy densities or fast charge extremes as the RISE innovation. The new RISE result appears to push the envelope further.

The Big Picture: What This Means for India & the World

Energy sovereignty: India can reduce its dependence on imported lithium battery systems, and develop domestic battery manufacturing capabilities.

Cost reduction: More affordable battery storage could make EVs, solar + battery systems, and microgrids much more accessible.

Competitive edge: If the technology scales well, Indian battery firms can compete globally.

Acceleration of clean energy adoption: With faster charging and reliable battery performance, the adoption curve for EVs and renewable energy systems could steepen.

Final Thoughts

The development of a sodium-ion battery in India that can charge to 94% in 5 minutes is a significant scientific and technological milestone. It addresses key challenges of cost, resource dependence, safety, and charging speed. However, the journey from prototype to commercial viability remains long and complex.

If India (or any country) can successfully scale and industrialize this technology, the ripple effects could transform the energy and mobility sectors.

This data will help researchers better understand how next-generation fuels might behave in a reactor accident.
“The purpose of refabrication is to get it as prototypical as possible to a real fuel rod,” Argyle said.
Next-generation nuclear fuels like the ATF rods from Westinghouse are designed to minimize the chance and severity of these consequences.
Our performance in this area will ultimately increase investment in new nuclear fuels.” Cory Hatch is a science writer for Idaho National Laboratory.","Instead of clamping down, Maupin maneuvers the clawlike tongs within millimeters of the fuel rod and hovers there. Another operator, Rob Cox, cuts through the fuel rod with a slow-speed diamond saw. The moment Cox finishes the cut, the section of the fuel rod drops away and Maupin snags it in midair with the manipulator tongs.

“Nice catch,” Cox says.

Over the coming months, Cox, Maupin, and their colleagues will repeat this operation dozens of times as they prepare next-generation fuel rods—designed and built by Westinghouse and irradiated in a commercial reactor—for postirradiation examination and testing.

Engineers designed the fuel to be accident tolerant and achieve high burnup.

Accident tolerant characteristics offer improved safety performance during normal operations, power spikes, and reactor accidents. These same characteristics can enable the fuel rods to achieve higher burnup (e.g., increased use of the fissionable uranium-235 in the fuel pellet) that could increase the electricity output of power plants and extend operating cycles—think increased horsepower and better fuel economy.

The stakes are high. These accident tolerant fuels (ATFs) could eventually power the entire U.S. reactor fleet.

Together, these technologies could save electricity ratepayers millions of dollars per year while increasing a nuclear power plant’s resilience under potential (though highly unlikely) accident conditions.

But first, industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission need terabytes of data on how those fuels perform. INL is one of the few places in the world with the capabilities and experts to quantify how nuclear fuel behaves during normal operating and accident conditions.

The chance to put high-burnup fuels and ATFs through their paces is the opportunity of a lifetime for the scores of INL experts involved in the tests. Now, after years of preparation, the tests are finally underway.

A long time coming

Discussions of a Westinghouse fuel shipment to INL began roughly a decade ago, but the real history of the fuel rods began in the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami. These combined events ravaged the Japanese coastline and severely damaged several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The plant power supplies and cooling systems for three of the four reactors were disabled, ultimately leading to significant core damage and the release of radioactive materials. This outcome might have been prevented if emergency personnel had more time to navigate washed up debris to deliver emergency electrical power or additional cooling water.

ATFs could provide plant operators with this increased margin for safety during abnormal operating conditions and, during an accident, could provide additional time to implement safety measures.

An added benefit of ATFs is that they can power a reactor longer, a feature known as high burnup. This feature is the nuclear industry’s immediate solution to provide the energy necessary to drive the modern economy, especially emerging needs for data centers driving artificial intelligence applications. Such fuels are designed to produce more energy, burning longer inside conventional light water reactors.

To answer those dual needs, Westinghouse is one of several companies that, under cooperative agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy, developed fuel with accident tolerant and high-burnup characteristics. After three rounds of irradiation testing at INL, the Westinghouse fuel was inserted in a commercial reactor in 2019.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory received a shipment of the Westinghouse fuel in 2021 for examination and testing in its Severe Accident Test Station, and INL received its first shipment of the fuel in December 2023.

Examining the fuel

Shielded by the four-foot-thick, multipaned windows at INL’s Hot Fuel Examination Facility, operators rely on an odd mixture of high and low tech to perform nondestructive and destructive examinations of the fuel and prepare it for irradiation tests. Alongside lasers and gamma spectrometers, there are rows of open-ended wrenches hanging on the wall.

Before Cox and Maupin make the fine cut to the fuel rods with their diamond saw, operators use a regular pipe cutter—the kind a plumber might use—to make a rough cut. The cutting locations are marked using a Sharpie wrapped in tape, which makes the marker easier to grip with the clawlike remote manipulators.

A thorough examination of the fuel rods, which have already sustained 54 months of neutron damage in the commercial reactor, establishes baseline data. This data will help researchers better understand how next-generation fuels might behave in a reactor accident.

“We perform extensive nondestructive examination so we can gather as much information as possible before starting destructive examinations,” said Aaron Colldeweih, lead investigator for the postirradiation examination of the Westinghouse fuel. “We’ll do visual exams, gamma spectrometry, and we’ll closely measure the diameter of the rods. That will give us an idea of how the cladding and the fuel interacted with each other during irradiation.”

As the U-235 in the fuel undergoes fission in the reactor, various radionuclides are created. Gamma spectrometry is used to detect the gamma radiation field being emitted from the rod at incremental steps along its entire length.

“We’re measuring gamma emissions at a very high resolution along the length of the rod,” Colldeweih said. “That allows us to define the location of the physical features that were part of the fuel assembly, like spacer grids or, inside the rod, like individual fuel pellets. This information helps guide us on where we want to cut the fuel rod for destructive examinations.”

Because each radionuclide emits a unique signature, the data also provide a glimpse into the irradiation history of the rod and the chemical behavior of the specific fission product species created by the fission process.

Another examination called profilometry closely measures surface dimensions of the rod. When those data are compared with the fuel rod’s original measurements, researchers can calculate how much the cladding dimensions changed over the lifetime of the fuel, where the cladding initially shrinks down around the fuel pellets and then expands as the fuel swells (primarily due to internal gas pressure). The internal pressure increases throughout irradiation as gaseous fission products accumulate inside the fuel rod. This measurement is used to estimate the remaining margin to failure.

Segmentation and destructive tests

Now the fuel rod is ready for segmentation and destructive tests, including irradiation tests, in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) or in the Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) Facility at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

Using a laser, researchers make a tiny puncture in the cladding to sample the fission gases that formed during irradiation and directly measure the gas pressure and the free volume within the rod. Samples of the gas are collected to perform compositional analysis.

“We start with13-foot-long fuel rods, and we need to get them into segments of about 10 inches for future TREAT tests,” Colldeweih said. “It involves fine cutting with very high accuracy. We also take a number of different samples from each fuel rod for isotopic and hydrogen measurements that ultimately support additional experiments required to understand material behavior and properties relevant to future fuel rod design.”

Experts then cut away sections of the cladding and fuel and prepare the samples for examination under conventional microscopes and electron microscopes at INL.

The microscopes allow researchers to see damage and changes that occurred during irradiation, such as cracks and pores in the fuel. The microscopes can also help identify where hydrogen-bearing phases, called hydrides, have precipitated in the cladding. These hydrides, which mostly arise from corrosion of the cladding in the reactor, can cause the cladding to become embrittled. Measuring that hydrogen provides important clues to understand damage incurred in the reactor core.

“There are interesting regions in the shape of rings to indicate how the fuel’s microstructure has evolved,” Colldeweih said. “It’s what happens to the fuel after it has been irradiated for a length of time, and it’s important for understanding how the fuel will behave in an accident scenario—and for understanding what’s going to happen in TREAT.”

Other samples of the cladding are subjected to mechanical tests that push, pull, or expand the sample to its breaking point to test its strength. “We will mill out different dog-bone shapes from the cladding wall, and we can test the sample strength in different directions,” Colldeweih said. “We perform axial-tension tests and hoop-tension tests, which allow us to measure the mechanical response of the material.”

Researchers also take density measurements of the fuel to learn how fission gases—which cause tiny bubbles and create porosity—and thermal expansion have changed the fuel’s density. “We want to know if the density changed from its nominal value and how that affects its performance and accident tolerance,” Colldeweih said.

The ultimate test: Accident conditions in TREAT

Much like the automobile industry, safety features must be demonstrated under extreme conditions to validate their performance. The hot cell examinations ultimately culminate in the nuclear equivalent of ramming several sports cars into a concrete wall.

In this case, sports cars are advanced fuel rods and the concrete wall is TREAT: a nuclear test reactor designed to deliver a short, high-intensity burst of radiation to push nuclear fuels and materials to their limit and beyond. In other words, TREAT is designed to break things under accident scenarios, much like crash testing a car.

“We want to know if a fuel will fail in a reactor and how it will fail,” said Jordan Argyle, one of the researchers involved in refabricating the fuel rods for the tests. “The only way to find out is to do the testing.”

“This may be the coolest thing happening at [INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex],” Argyle continued.

Fabricating rodlets for accident testing

The rodlet must be capable of withstanding internal pressures of over 1,000 psi to accommodate the fission gases that result from the tests.

Once the rodlet is ready, “we need to load in a bunch of rodlet internals,” Argyle said. “There are pellets of a ceramic material that create a thermal buffer to keep heat from melting the end caps. They also help replicate the thermodynamics of a big fuel rod in a reactor. There are also springs to keep it all together. It’s an extremely tight fit.”

Then the end caps are welded onto the cladding. Throughout this process, experts use spotting scopes—the same kind that hunters use—to inspect the weld.

Technicians then use a small hole, 20 thousandths of an inch in diameter, through which they inject a mixture of helium and argon gases to replicate the thermal properties of a fission gas mixture. That hole is then welded shut.

The endcaps are heavily instrumented so researchers can get live data out of the fuel rod while it is in the reactor. These sensors measure everything from acoustic emissions and capsule pressure to temperature and mechanical movement.

“We just completed the easiest fabrication,” Argyle said. “They’re going to continue to get more complicated. Some of the sensors have wires, and you have to be careful not to destroy the wires. Some have much more volume and much higher pressures, and they’re talking about welding thermocouples [devices that measure temperature] directly onto the cladding.”

Once experts have segmented the 13-foot fuel rods and taken samples of the fuel and the cladding, each segment must be reassembled into a sealed rodlet for insertion into the transient water irradiation system (TWIST) capsule—an experiment capsule designed for specialized testing. The process requires a high degree of precision for the rodlet to perform like a normal fuel rod.

“The purpose of refabrication is to get it as prototypical as possible to a real fuel rod,” Argyle said.

Completing each rodlet takes a team of dedicated experts. “There are probably 26 people, from receipt to welding, who are integral to this process,” Argyle said. “If you took any one of those people away, we wouldn’t be able to do this.”

Once the rodlet is assembled and tested in the rodlet holder, the TWIST device is assembled, and the rodlet is loaded inside. This integrated configuration—the TWIST capsule—is then ready for the experiment.

To ensure safety, once the TWIST module is assembled, it is placed inside an irradiation system known as Big-BUSTER (broad use specimen transient experiment rig). The 9-foot-long zirconium-niobium alloy pipe provides the safety pressure boundary used for irradiation testing in TREAT.

The experiment, housed in Big-BUSTER, is transferred to TREAT via a shielded cask. The experiment is then inserted into TREAT and all instrumentation is checked out to determine functionality after shipping and handling.

INL technicians will fabricate three more rodlets in the next fiscal year, with two to six rodlets fabricated each year thereafter for the foreseeable future.

“The sheer volume of data we’re able to collect has a lot of people interested,” Argyle said.

Mimicking accident scenarios

One type of test performed in the TWIST device is a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), a type of postulated accident in a commercial power plant where the water drains out of reactor core due to a highly unlikely severe disruption of its mechanical systems. In this scenario, the core could heat up, resulting in several potential consequences, including a release of radioactivity due to fuel damage (popularly referred to as a meltdown). Next-generation nuclear fuels like the ATF rods from Westinghouse are designed to minimize the chance and severity of these consequences.

TWIST looks a little like a barbell tipped on its end and features two chambers. The top chamber—the TWIST capsule—holds nuclear fuel, water, and instrumentation.

During a LOCA test, TREAT reactor operators bombard the fuel, surrounded by water, in the TWIST capsule with an intense burst of radiation for around 30 seconds. This burst of radiation establishes thermal conditions like a normal operating fuel pin in a commercial reactor. Then, the accident event simulation starts by draining the water into an empty tank at the bottom chamber of the TWIST capsule.

Operators then subject the fuel rod, minus the water, to a lower-level radiation burst for 100 additional seconds, simulating the fuel rods’ residual heat generation during an accident. Both the irradiation times and TREAT power levels can be easily modified by the experimenter and are adjusted based on the test’s specific objectives.

Normally, the rodlet increases in temperature until the specimen fails, acccording to Klint Anderson, an experiment design engineer at INL. “In other words, the rod gets really hot,” he said. “This increase in temperature, combined with the pressure differential between the pressurized rod and lower-pressure capsule, can cause the cladding to balloon and burst.”

While a loss-of-coolant condition (known as an undercooling scenario) is the more restrictive safety event, the system can also be used to explore other types of events, such as reactivity insertion accidents (known as overpower scenarios). In a reactivity insertion accident test, TREAT operators bombard the submerged fuel rod with a pulse of neutron radiation that simulates sudden removal of a control rod from a commercial reactor core. During this test, the water never drains from the TWIST capsule.

“The water remains at the same water level the whole time,” Anderson said. “We put it in TREAT with a higher-power pulse to look at things like the pellet cladding mechanical interaction or sudden pressure spikes from the water quickly boiling.”

Once the experiments are completed in TREAT, the rodlets will be transferred back to the Hot Fuel Examination Facility for disassembly and post-transient examinations, which will occur over the summer and fall of 2025.

Why these tests are important

In the end, “crash testing” these high-burnup and ATF rods will help industry license these rods’ designs for reactors operating across the country. The result is safer, higher-performing nuclear reactors.

“The advanced fuel is special because it marks a new era of innovation for commercial LWRs,” said Dan Wachs, national technical director of the DOE’s Advanced Fuels Campaign at INL.

“Innovation in the LWR community stagnated for several decades,” he said. “The start of the Accident Tolerant Fuels program really started a reawakening of the desire for innovation in the commercial nuclear reactor sector.”

It took about 10 years to get the initial ideas for advanced fuels to the point where researchers could perform demonstrations in commercial reactors.

“But to really assess them properly, we need to do examinations in our hot cells,” Wachs said.

INL is one of the best and, in some cases, the only place for companies to get data about their fuels to verify their performance and ultimately get approval from the NRC. With the success of the initial experiments in TREAT, the nuclear energy industry will gain confidence that its innovations can be commercialized.

“By examining and testing fuels from Westinghouse and other manufacturers, INL researchers are providing industry with a clear pathway to get their fuels to market,” Wachs said. “Success just generates an appetite for more innovation. Our performance in this area will ultimately increase investment in new nuclear fuels.”

The proposed BESS fire safety codes will go a long way to reduce the risk of thermal runaways within new BESS installations in New York.
Why New York’s fire safety codes are a good start Until now, there have been only a very limited number of fire safety codes or regulations specifically designed to protect BESS sites against fire risks.
Standardise fire safety codes: Fragmented fire safety codes and regulations create headaches for developers and confusion across the industry.
Moving forward, BESS safety codes should introduce stronger fire safety protections.","New York State is one of the biggest advocates of battery energy storage systems (BESS) technology in the US, setting an ambitious target of 6GW of energy storage by 2030. They are pushing ahead with multiple new projects despite significant headwinds from community opposition groups. In the last year alone, the state broke ground on 7.5MW of capacity and approved a further five BESS projects totalling 42.5MW.

Yet a string of isolated, high-profile BESS fires over the last few years in the state (Jefferson, Orange, and Suffolk counties) has created public unease about the technology and emboldened local opposition groups that threaten projects at a pivotal stage in the energy transition. Local opposition groups have also increasingly used evocative language, such as “BESS is a clear and present danger to our health and financial well-being”, to stir up opposition to projects.

In response, State officials have introduced a new set of BESS fire safety codes aimed at addressing public concerns and enhancing site safety. While New York’s BESS fire safety codes represent a crucial first step for BESS safety, serving as a regulatory model for other states, more must be done to protect sites and reassure communities about their safety.

The proposed BESS fire safety codes will go a long way to reduce the risk of thermal runaways within new BESS installations in New York. It is a welcome innovation of public policy that will support BESS adoption.

Why New York’s fire safety codes are a good start

Until now, there have been only a very limited number of fire safety codes or regulations specifically designed to protect BESS sites against fire risks. That’s why New York’s new BESS fire safety codes – officially adopted in July this year (2025) – mark a significant step forward for the industry when it comes to fire safety. Under the new codes, developers are required to:

These new codes clearly set a solid baseline for fire safety standards within the BESS industry, and they will go some way to reassuring the public that sites are being properly protected. However, the new safety codes do not go as far as offering guidance for developers/owners to include fire safety protection – a key talking point for community action groups. Without strong fire safety protections, New York and the industry as a whole risk stalling the rollout of BESS sites, held up by influential community groups. Given the recent flurry of high-profile isolated BESS fires, the safety code detailing requirements to protect sites will help mitigate community opposition.

Strengthening fire safety standards to build public trust

To address public safety concerns and gain support from critics, regulators, and developers must collaborate to establish comprehensive fire safety regulations that include:

1. Mandate advanced fire detection and suppression systems: Requiring all BESS sites to have advanced fire detection and suppression systems installed from the start is critical to winning over opponents. In fact, a recent report from Firetrace International, which surveyed nearly 4,000 citizens across the US, found that 66% of US citizens would support a BESS project if fire suppression systems were installed from the outset.

2. Standardise fire safety codes: Fragmented fire safety codes and regulations create headaches for developers and confusion across the industry. By establishing consistent and clear fire safety standards across the industry, we can enhance fire protection, ultimately helping to alleviate public opposition.

3. Transparent incident reporting: Making sure developers share data and information on recent fire incidents is essential to improving safety standards and updating fire safety codes. This includes creating public databases that regulators, firefighters, developers, and the public can access to see what went wrong, what was fixed, and how sites are being made safer.

4. Disclose fire safety plans: Requiring developers to disclose their fire safety plans and the steps they have taken to protect sites will go a long way to securing public support. Firetrace’s survey found that 47% of US citizens would be more comfortable with a BESS site if they had a clear understanding of the safety measures, demonstrating the importance of introducing fire safety disclosure requirements.

The successful rollout of BESS hinges on the industry reassuring the public that sites are safe, secure, and will create significant benefits for the community. But, as it stands, many locals are concerned about having BESS sites in their backyard, which is understandable given the recent isolated fires that have hit the front pages.

As an industry, we need to do more to reassure the public that BESS is a relatively safe technology and demonstrate that we’re doing all we can to protect sites and improve safety standards. New York’s new fire safety codes are a significant first step toward achieving this. Moving forward, BESS safety codes should introduce stronger fire safety protections. This will help win over community opposition groups and accelerate the rollout of one of the most important technologies of our generation, which is vital for achieving sustainability targets such as net-zero by 2050.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltfe9b47e05a5cb35d/68f2850c8fbaca10462a3884/BESS.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 14:03:57.496930

Earlier this year, a two-thirds majority of the state Legislature passed the joint resolutions calling for the constitutional amendment elections, along with the state’s budget for the next two years, which includes $51 billion for property tax cuts.

Texas lawmakers have used multibillion-dollar budget surpluses, the result of inflation and temporary federal stimulus dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic, to pay for tax cuts in recent years. Proponents of tax cuts and bans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have said they will maintain Texas as a competitive, business-friendly state and contribute to economic growth.

But some lawmakers and budget analysts have raised concerns that passing more tax cuts, especially on school district taxes which the state helps pay for, could be unsustainable.

“We always have to kind of balance giving folks tax relief versus making sure that we still preserve revenue for those public services,” said Shannon Halbrook, a fiscal policy director for the left-leaning Every Texan.

With lots of tax cuts and tax bans, especially through these upcoming constitutional amendment elections, the state and local governments could face a hard time paying for public services such as education, health care, and infrastructure needs in the future, Halbrook said.

Officials with Texas cities and counties say they are already being forced to either cut spending or raise taxes and fees to make up for budgets stretched thin by economic uncertainty, inflation, strict state limits on property tax collections and uncertainty around future federal funds. That’s why some Texans, like voters in Austin, will also see local propositions asking them to approve increasing local property tax rates.

If the constitutional amendments are approved, a majority of state lawmakers and Texas voters would need to pass new constitutional amendments to undo measures. Constitutional amendments are the only ballot propositions Texans get to vote on at the state level and will appear on the top of voters’ ballots, above any local races or measures they may be deciding.

To weigh in on the constitutional amendments, Texas voters need to be registered to vote by Oct. 6. Early voting will run from Oct. 20-31, and election day is Nov. 4. The deadline for counties to receive applications to vote by mail is Oct. 24. For more information on voting requirements, read our guide to voting in Texas.

Here’s a brief breakdown of the constitutional amendments.

A majority of the proposed constitutional amendments are measures meant to lower taxes for various Texans, including:

Homeowners.

Businesses.

Elderly and disabled homeowners.

Spouses of veterans.

Homeowners who had their home destroyed in a fire.

Property owners with border security infrastructure.

Those who sell animal feed.

Other proposed amendments would prevent the state from imposing additional taxes on:

Personal or business capital gains.

Securities transactions and those working in securities.

Inheritances.

Other proposals would fund:

Water infrastructure.

The Texas State Technical College.

Research on dementia treatment and prevention.

A few proposals would amend the constitution to:

Limit when a person can be released on bail.

Enshrine parental rights.

Clarify citizenship requirements for Texas voters.

Overhaul the State Commission on Judicial Conduct.

Read more below about what each proposition will look like on the ballot and what it would mean for Texans.

Proposition 1 (SJR 59): Texas State Technical College funding

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment providing for the creation of the permanent technical institution infrastructure fund and the available workforce education fund to support the capital needs of educational programs offered by the Texas State Technical College System.”

What it means: This amendment would create an endowment for the Texas State Technical College Program.

Unlike other public two-year colleges, Texas State Technical College does not have taxing authority to issue bonds, and underfunding has led to a halt in critical capital improvements. If voters approve the constitutional amendment, TSTC officials have said they will use the money to fix campus infrastructure, upgrade classroom equipment and expand its footprint across the state.

This comes after Gov. Greg Abbott made workforce training a priority during the regular legislative session. Texas employers have been signaling a decline in skilled workers for fields such as plumbing and welding, saying this could threaten Texas’ economy.

Proponents of this allocation of funds say it would help build facilities for training and close the skills gap in Texas. Critics have said creating an endowment for TSTC would limit government spending oversight and transparency. — Olla Mokhtar, Sneha Dey

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): Capital gains tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment prohibiting the imposition of a tax on the realized or unrealized capital gains of an individual, family, estate, or trust.”

What it means: This would ban the state from taxing people or businesses on profits or potential profits from capital assets, such as investments, real estate, valuable items and certain personal property. It would also eliminate a franchise tax on business trusts, which would lead the state to lose an estimated $152,000 in revenue per fiscal year, according to the state comptroller’s office.

Proponents of the capital gains tax ban say it doubles down on the state’s income tax ban, which was approved by voters in 2019. State lawmakers suggested in an analysis they don’t want to repeat what happened in Washington state where officials there enacted a capital gains tax despite also prohibiting a state income tax. And during legislative discussions, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican from Southlake who sponsored the proposal, said that the franchise tax on business trusts “could be construed as a capital gains tax undermining Texas economic competitiveness.” — María Méndez

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): Bail reform

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment requiring the denial of bail under certain circumstances to persons accused of certain offenses punishable as a felony.”

What it means: This proposition would require judges to deny bail in certain cases for individuals accused of committing specific felonies, such as murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child. The state would have to demonstrate that bail is not enough to prevent the defendant from being a flight or public safety risk. Defendants, who are legally presumed innocent, would also be entitled to the right to an attorney during their bail hearings.

The proposal is part of a broad legislative package that Texas Republican leaders have said is needed to reduce violent crimes committed by people out on bond and to curb the ability of “activist judges” to set “weak bail.” Civil rights groups said keeping more people behind bars would add to overcrowded jails without actually improving public safety, while also pointing to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says “liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.”

Under the Texas Constitution, most defendants have the right to be released on bail except for certain cases, such as those charged with capital murder or accused of certain repeat felonies. — Alex Nguyen

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): Water infrastructure funding

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to dedicate a portion of the revenue derived from state sales and use taxes to the Texas water fund and to provide for the allocation and use of that revenue.”

What it means: Texas’ water supply is facing numerous threats, including an increasing demand for water due to rapid population growth, millions of gallons of water leaking out of old infrastructure, and climate change contributing to more droughts and altering precipitation patterns. By one estimate, the state’s municipal supply will not meet demand by 2030 if a major drought were to hit the state and no water solutions are implemented.

A Texas 2036 report estimated that the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure, including $59 billion for water supply projects, $74 billion for leaky pipes and infrastructure maintenance, and $21 billion to fix broken wastewater systems.

To help the state boost and protect its water supply, state lawmakers are asking voters to approve $20 billion for water projects over the next two decades. If approved, up to $1 billion of sales tax revenue would be deposited into the Texas Water Fund each year starting in 2027. The money would go to fixing aging pipes and other infrastructure; developing and increasing new water sources, such as desalination; flood mitigation projects; and supporting conservation efforts to help meet water demands.The amendment would also give the Texas Water Development Board flexibility in distributing funds. — Alejandra Martinez

Proposition 5 (HJR 99): Tax exemption on animal feed

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation tangible personal property consisting of animal feed held by the owner of the property for sale at retail.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow state lawmakers to extend tax exemptions on animal feed to include when animal feed is held as inventory to be sold. State Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, noted animal feed is already typically tax exempt when it is harvested or purchased by a farmer or rancher.

If the constitutional amendment is approved, accompanying legislation from Harris would exempt animal feed inventory from property taxes. That would lower local property tax revenue and require the state to help school districts make up for that loss, but those costs are not expected to be significant, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board.

Only a few individuals registered against the proposed constitutional amendment during legislative committee hearings. Critics have said this gives animal feed sellers an unfair advantage, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 6 (HJR 4): Securities tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment prohibiting the legislature from enacting a law imposing an occupation tax on certain entities that enter into transactions conveying securities or imposing a tax on certain securities transactions.”

What it means: This proposal would prevent the state from creating new taxes on securities transactions, such as stock trading, and from taxing those who operate or work in the securities market, including financial institutions, brokers and dealers.

It was prompted by a new stock exchange expected to open in Texas and to protect investments, including retirement accounts and pensions, following discussions of taxing financial transactions in other states, according to analysis of the resolution calling for the constitutional amendment.

A few individuals registered against the proposal during legislative committee hearings, and critics have said the state could benefit from these taxes should it need to raise more revenue in the future, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): Tax exemption for veterans’ spouses

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to provide for an exemption from ad valorem taxation of all or part of the market value of the residence homestead of the surviving spouse of a veteran who died as a result of a condition or disease that is presumed under federal law to have been service-connected.”

What it means: This change would allow state lawmakers to give property tax breaks on homes to the un-remarried spouses of U.S. veterans who the federal government determined died in connection to their service. State Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, said during legislative discussions that the change is meant to align Texas with a more recent federal law that expanded benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service.

Accompanying legislation by Turner would exempt qualifying spouses of veterans from paying any property taxes on their home if they have not remarried. The state would have to make up the reduced property tax revenue for local school districts, but it is not expected to be a significant cost, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board. An estimated 3,000 spouses could potentially benefit from the exemption, according to the fiscal note. — María Méndez

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): Inheritance tax ban

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to prohibit the legislature from imposing death taxes applicable to a decedent’s property or the transfer of an estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, or gift.”

What it means: Though Texas does not currently have an inheritance tax, this measure aims to prevent lawmakers from trying to impose a tax on an estate or when an estate or inheritance is transferred. It would not eliminate other existing taxes that can be associated with an inheritance, such as unpaid property taxes, according to committee discussions on the proposal. Critics of this constitutional amendment have said it is unnecessary and would limit state lawmakers in the future, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): Inventory and equipment tax exemption

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to exempt from ad valorem taxation a portion of the market value of tangible personal property a person owns that is held or used for the production of income.”

What it means: This amendment, along with accompanying legislation, would exempt up to $125,000 of businesses’ inventory or equipment from being taxed by school districts, cities, counties or any other taxing entity. Under current law, businesses don’t have to pay taxes on that property if it’s worth $2,500 or less.

The state would help pick up the tab for the amount of property tax revenue school districts would lose. This would cost the state an estimated $193.5 million from general revenue in 2027 and more than $100 million annually from general revenue in subsequent fiscal years, according to a fiscal note from the Legislative Budget Board. Other taxing entities like cities and counties would either have to raise tax rates to make up for the lost revenue, or go without it.

Critics, including some local officials, have noted that the tax cuts could be applied by businesses at multiple locations, according to the House Research Organization. Proponents, including several business and industry associations, have said eliminating administrative and tax burdens for businesses would contribute to economic growth that could outweigh local revenue losses. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): Tax exemption for homes destroyed by fire

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to provide for a temporary exemption from ad valorem taxation of the appraised value of an improvement to a residence homestead that is completely destroyed by a fire.”

What it means: This amendment and accompanying legislation would create a process to temporarily lower property taxes on homes destroyed by fire. Homeowners could apply for an adjusted tax bill on the restored home for the year in which the fire occurred, according to the accompanying legislation. To qualify, the homeowner’s home would have to remain uninhabitable for at least 30 days after the fire. These property tax bill reductions could lower local tax revenue and require the state to help make up for school districts’ losses, but potential costs for the state could not be calculated, according to the legislation’s fiscal note. — María Méndez

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): School tax exemption for the elderly or disabled homeowners

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to increase the amount of the exemption from ad valorem taxation by a school district of the market value of the residence homestead of a person who is elderly or disabled.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow the state to raise a homestead exemption, a discount on school property taxes that lowers how much of a home’s value can be taxed to pay for public schools. The increased exemption would shave off $60,000 from the taxable value of elderly or disabled Texans’ homes, rather than just $10,000 under the current exemption.

Coupled with another homestead exemption generally available to Texas homeowners, which lawmakers are also asking voters to increase to $140,000 through another ballot proposition, elderly or disabled Texans could get homestead exemptions of up to $200,000 if the other proposition is also approved by voters.

If the increased exemption for elderly or disabled homeowners is approved by voters, the state would have to help pay for revenue school districts lose. That could cost the state more than $1.2 billion in general revenue for the next two fiscal years and upwards of $477 million annually after that, according to a fiscal note from the state’s Legislative Budget Board. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down.

Though these tax cuts for elderly and disabled Texans haven’t faced much public pushback, some have raised concerns that such broad exemptions could be unsustainable for the state to pay for in the future. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): Changing the State Judicial Conduct Commission

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment regarding the membership of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, the membership of the tribunal to review the commission’s recommendations, and the authority of the commission, the tribunal, and the Texas Supreme Court to more effectively sanction judges and justices for judicial misconduct.”

What it means: This amendment would change the make-up of Texas’ State Commission on Judicial Conduct and related processes and powers.

Currently, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct is made up of the following:

six judges from six different court levels,

two attorneys appointed by the State Bar of Texas who aren’t judges, and

five citizens appointed by the governor who are at least 30 years of age and aren’t attorneys or judges.

If approved, the constitutional amendment would beef up the citizen representation on the commission by changing the makeup to:

six judges or justices of courts appointed by the Texas Supreme Court of, two of whom would have to be trial court judges (judicial members of the commission would not be allowed to be judges in the same type of court), and

seven citizens appointed by the governor, who are at least 35 years of age.

Commission members would still have to be confirmed by the Texas Senate.

Other significant changes to the judicial conduct review process would tweak how the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court selects review tribunals. These tribunals, made up of seven Court of Appeals justices, review the commission’s recommendation for the removal or retirement of a judge. The amendment would also adjust when and how the commission and review tribunal would have to discipline judges, including in some cases by prohibiting a person from holding judicial office in the future.

The terms of the current commissioners would expire by July 2026. A temporary provision in the constitutional amendment would authorize the Texas Supreme Court and the governor to begin appointing additional commissioners with staggered terms, of either six, four or two years, beginning in 2026.

Proponents of the proposed changes said they would promote transparency and accountability in the judicial system and allow judicial misconduct to be addressed fairly and swiftly. Some critics said that increasing the number of members of the public on the commission could politicize the judicial discipline process, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): Increased school tax exemption for homeowners

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to increase the amount of the exemption of residence homesteads from ad valorem taxation by a school district from $100,000 to $140,000.”

What it means: This constitutional amendment would allow Texans who own their home to see a boost in the state’s homestead exemption, or the slice of a home’s value that can’t be taxed to pay for public schools. The proposal would shave off $140,000 off the taxable value of the home, instead of the current $100,000.

The owner of a typical Texas home — valued at $302,000 last year, according to Zillow — would have saved about $490 on their school property taxes had the higher exemption been in place last year, a Tribune calculation shows. Those savings result from a combination of the increased homestead exemption and cuts to school tax rates in the state’s upcoming two-year budget.

Accompanying legislation would put the state on the hook for the revenue school districts lose if the increased exemption passes. That’s estimated to cost the state more than $2.7 billion in general revenue for the 2026-2027 budget cycle and more than $1 billion annually after that, according to the fiscal note for the accompanying school finance legislation. Recapture payments, or the tax revenue that school districts with higher property values send back to the state to help fund poorer school districts, would also go down.

Some critics have said the state should do more to limit local tax rates and spending so that tax bills don’t continue to rise, according to the House Research Organization. — María Méndez, Joshua Fechter

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): Funding for dementia research and prevention

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment providing for the establishment of the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, establishing the Dementia Prevention and Research Fund to provide money for research on and prevention and treatment of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and related disorders in this state, and transferring to that fund $3 billion from state general revenue.”

What it means: This amendment would provide $3 billion to create the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and other brain related conditions. The measure received bipartisan support from a majority of lawmakers and was one of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick’s legislative priorities.

If voters approve the constitutional amendment, an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue would be transferred to the fund, and a board appointed by Patrick, House Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, and Gov. Greg Abbott would be set up to approve research proposals. Going forward, the institute would receive up to $300 million annually. This funding is intended to attract physicians, researchers, and experts to Texas.

The fund and institute are modeled after the state’s Cancer Research and Prevention Institute, which has become the country’s second largest funder of cancer research. — Olla Mokhtar, Terri Langford

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): Codifying parental rights

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment affirming that parents are the primary decision makers for their children.”

What it means: This proposal would include parental rights, as currently outlined out in federal case law, in the Texas Constitution. The intent of the amendment is to protect parental rights since “case law can change and disappear over time with the appointment of new judges,” according to an analysis of the legislation.

The constitution would be amended to include the following: “Provides that, to enshrine truths that are deeply rooted in this nation’s history and traditions, the people of Texas hereby affirm that a parent has the responsibility to nurture and protect the parent’s child and the corresponding fundamental right to exercise care, custody, and control of the parent’s child, including the right to make decisions concerning the child’s upbringing.”

Some questions were raised during legislative discussions about how the proposal would ensure children’s voices are also heard. — María Méndez

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): Clarifying citizenship requirement for voters

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment clarifying that a voter must be a United States citizen.”

What it means: This amendment would add language to the Texas Constitution to explicitly say that “persons who are not citizens of the United States” cannot vote in the state. Though U.S. citizenship is already required to register to vote in Texas, this amendment aims to prevent local governments in Texas from allowing local residents who are not citizens to vote in local elections and comes in response to other states passing such policies, according to analysis of the legislation.

Critics of the measure said it is redundant and unnecessary. — María Méndez

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): Property tax exemption for border security infrastructure

The ballot language: “The constitutional amendment to authorize the legislature to provide for an exemption from ad valorem taxation of the amount of the market value of real property located in a county that borders the United Mexican States that arises from the installation or construction on the property of border security infrastructure and related improvements.”

What it means: This proposal and accompanying legislation would allow the state to prevent property value in border counties from increasing due to border security infrastructure and related improvements.

This new exemption could reduce local tax revenue, but costs to the state to help address school district losses are not expected to be significant, according to a fiscal note. Other local governments may have to raise tax rates to offset the losses, according to the fiscal note.

Proponents of the measure say this will address concerns that border security infrastructure added to private land by the state could increase that property’s appraisal and burden on property owners, according to the House Research Organization. Critics have said the state should not incentivize more border security infrastructure on private land and that the change could shift the tax burden to other local property owners. — María Méndez

On the other hand, the U.S. is grappling with whipsaw effects from slower-than-anticipated adoption, the loss of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases, implementation of tariffs on import vehicles and auto parts, and the rollback of emissions and other environmental standards.

If you're an auto investor who doesn't look fondly upon those developments, just wait a few minutes and it'll probably change, for better or worse. Here's the latest issue facing investors and the EV industry.

Profit-eroding incentives

With the federal $7,500 tax credit ending with the month of September, automakers trying to move EV inventory are digging into their own pockets to drive demand. General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) had previously found an intriguing loophole to use their finance arms to place down payments on EVs with intentions to pass that along to the consumer later. But both quickly ended those programs after pressure from politicians claimed the workarounds were ""nefarious."" Now the two Detroit auto icons are offering competitive lease payments and other costly incentives to make EV purchases compelling.

Hyundai Motor decided to push a $7,500 cash incentive on its 2025 Ioniq 5 for October, while also cutting the small crossover's price by nearly $10,000 for 2026. Similarly, Ford and GM's crosstown rival, Stellantis, began offering generous incentives to offset the loss of the federal tax credit immediately following its end. Those are just a handful of examples of how incentives are on the rise, but let's dig a little deeper as the issue spans the industry.

EV incentives peaked in July at 16% of average transaction prices (ATPs), according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights, and at $8,900 during September the incentives remained above 15% of ATPs. That's more than twice the level for overall U.S. light vehicles that reached 7.4% in September, and still significantly above pre-pandemic levels that were typically around 10% of ATPs.

Unfortunately for automakers and investors alike, these profit-eroding incentives are a necessary evil due to the price gap between combustion engine vehicles and EVs. The average price for a new U.S. light vehicle was $47,962 in March 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book data cited by Experian, which remains near record highs. Meanwhile, the ATP for an EV in September reached $58,124, according to data from Cox.

What's the solution?

For automakers and investors, reducing these profit-killing incentives is important, and the arrival of truly affordable models is imperative. On that front, there's a bit of good news. One example is none other than General Motors' unveiling of the new Chevrolet Bolt.

The Chevy Bolt was released for the 2017 model year and was the automaker's first legitimate attempt at a modern EV. It was lauded as a great car in an ideal size and segment at a compelling price -- but due to an extended recall GM retired the vehicle in 2023 despite the Bolt posting its best sales year.

Now the Chevrolet Bolt is coming back in the early months of 2026 for round two.

The look and design of the two Bolts are very similar, especially viewing the exterior. The new Bolt offers about the same horsepower and will charge about three times faster than the previous generation. But the real kicker, especially for investors, is the price tag -- it ranges from $28,995 for the LT trim up to $32,000 for an RS trim, with an LT trim package between the two at $29,990. If you're keeping track, that makes the upcoming Bolt the cheapest EV announced across the U.S. market. The only problem is that currently the upcoming Bolt is allegedly only available for a limited time.

What it all means

While GM is preparing to launch the new Bolt at a compelling price point, the ever-changing EV industry dynamics aren't as pleasant for other automakers. That's true even for EV juggernaut Tesla, which has recently launched ""Standard"" and more affordable trims of its popular Model 3 and Model Y.

However, Tesla's strategy wasn't to start from the ground up for a truly compelling new affordable EV. Rather, the automaker opted to slash features and pinch pennies. All in all, Tesla was able to drop the Model Y Standard price down to $39,990 without shipping, about $5,000 less than the previous base price, and the Model 3 Standard down to $38,630, roughly $5,500 in savings. The problem is that due to the removal of features, the value proposition may not be compelling, and the lower-priced models could end up cannibalizing sales of more profitable trims and eroding margins themselves.

Further, for investors of pure-play EV makers such as Rivian and Lucid, the pain will be more drastic. These EV makers don't have a line of combustion engine vehicles to fall back on while the markets work through all the EV industry changes, policy rollbacks, and incentive spend.

The solution is as it's always been: produce a compelling EV at a comparable price to combustion engine counterparts. But the industry simply isn't quite there yet. Long-term investors would be wise to prepare for a few bumpy quarters and more hefty EV losses while incentives and high costs take a toll. The future is bright, but patience is required.

I've written recently about how all of these companies will lose a critical profit source in 2026. Automotive regulatory credits -- which previously brought in billions in ""free"" profit industrywide -- now have essentially zero value due to regulatory changes. But there's another challenge that Rivian, Lucid, and Tesla will soon face that could be even more damaging.

Demand for electric vehicles could be ""dreadful"" in 2026

According to research published in The New York Times, electric vehicle sales are expected to be ""dreadful"" next year. The demise won't wait until 2026 to begin, however. ""Sales of electric models are expected to plummet in the last three months of the year and then remain sluggish for some time,"" the article concludes.

The primary cause is clear: Earlier this year, the U.S. government eliminated tax credits for EV purchases. Because the tax credits expired at the end of September, many consumers raced to buy their vehicles before the deadline in order to lock in their financial incentives.

Previously, tax credits effectively reduced the cost of buying an EV by up to $7,500. A $55,000 vehicle, therefore, would essentially cost just $47,500. That's a big deal. Recent polling suggests that nearly 70% of American consumers want their next car to cost under $50,000.

When tax credits and other subsidies were reduced or eliminated in other countries, demand promptly fell off a cliff. That was the case for Germany in 2023, as well as Canada in 2025. Much of this demand slump will simply be due to a lumpy order book. Buyers who would have purchased in January 2026, for instance, may have accelerated their purchase to September 2025.

Investors should, therefore, be very skeptical about improving demand figures posted this upcoming quarter. The quarter that follows may, as the New York Times warns, generate ""dreadful"" sales growth rates.

Don't give up on Rivian, Tesla, or Lucid just yet

EV makers like Rivian, Tesla, and Lucid may have a rocky few quarters ahead. But that doesn't mean investors should ditch these stocks en masse. Long term, EV adoption is still expected to rise.

You may, however, want to conduct some asset reallocation based on this information. The company that will arguably be hit the least when it comes to eliminated tax credits for EV purchases is Tesla. It may see pressure on sales growth, but it has reliable access to capital. This will allow it to continue to invest in high-growth opportunities like robotaxis, as well as push to get a long-awaited $30,000 model to market. At that price point, these models will likely be cheap enough to see robust demand despite the absence of federal tax credits.

Rivian, meanwhile, is set to get its first affordable model to market: the R2. Two cheaper models -- the R3 and R3X -- are set to follow the R2, which is expected to begin production early next year. The R2 is expected to debut at $45,000. Even without incentives, that's below the $50,000 price point most buyers are targeting.

Lucid faces the most difficult road. The company has teased more affordable models for years, but the most aggressive timeline calls for production to begin by December 2026. Due to financial constraints and ancillary investment in other opportunities like robotaxis, it may take several more years to bring more affordable models to market. In a world where buyers are increasingly cost conscious, Lucid may struggle in a competitive landscape bereft of tax credits.

EV makers face a difficult road ahead. But opportunities remain. Instead of ditching the industry altogether, investors may be wise to simply reallocate their bets to the companies best positioned to succeed in new conditions.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835956/gettyimages-175165308-1201x802-c248ac3.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 04:58:30.924952

For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move.
In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions.
Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry.
Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century.","Under intense pressure from Donald Trump’s government, countries have postponed plans to force shipowners to start paying for the damage they do to the climate.

US officials were accused of “bullying” and “intimidation”, as nations met in London for what should have been the rubber-stamping of a decision made months ago to place a small levy on the greenhouse gases from global shipping.

Instead, after four days of intense wrangling, the US efforts appeared to pay off in a decisive vote late on Friday afternoon at the International Maritime Organisation headquarters in London.

A majority of countries present voted to put the plans for an emissions pricing mechanism on hold for a year. While this means the measure survives, and could still be imposed, it also gives the US and its allies – including Russia, Saudi Arabia and other petrostates – an opportunity to step up their pressure on other countries to ditch the charge.

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO secretary general, said the outcome was not a cause for celebration. Taking aim at the fractious nature of the discussions, he chided delegates: “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

The measure, which would mean shipowners pay a small charge on the CO2 produced by their vessels and have incentives to seek cleaner fuels and upgrade their ships, was passed in a majority vote in April. But under the complex rules of the world’s shipping regulator, that vote had to be reaffirmed at a further meeting this week.

For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move. In the past fortnight, this was stepped up to what some countries said amounted to an unprecedented campaign against them.

The US threatened countries, and individual officials, with tariffs, penalties and visa revocations if they supported the pricing mechanism.

Dr Simon Bullock, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Yet again, powerful fossil fuel states are successfully blocking global efforts to cooperate on climate change. This is not the result the industry wanted, nor one the world’s people can afford. Progressive shipping businesses and nations can still chart a course to a clean shipping future, but Mr Trump’s aggressive, destructive lobbying has their made their job much harder.”

Meanwhile, some petrostates including Saudi Arabia held out the offer of sweeteners to countries that voted against the plan, which has been several years in the making.

In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions. In April, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate minister, expressed the frustration of many small developing nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

After Friday’s vote, countries will have to reconvene in a year to consider the proposal again. The delay means uncertainty and confusion for companies involved in shipping and in the global trade in many key commodities.

John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “By delaying adoption of its net zero framework, the IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown. With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Even if the measure is agreed next year, it will take years to come into force, as IMO rules mean it must be subject to a further period of technical assessment and review of how it can be implemented. That could mean a delay until near the end of this decade, at least.

Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry. Much of the money would be used to help companies upgrade their vessels and move to lower carbon fuels, and pay for modifications to ports, rather than be allocated to poor countries to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, as many had hoped.

If it is eventually passed, the measure is not likely to place significant costs on imported goods, despite the concerns of some exporting countries.

Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century. The IMO has been working on various plans to reduce carbon from shipping for the last two decades, but progress has been slow.

The extraordinary scenes at the IMO, where discussions are normally staid and highly technical, bodes ill for further talks on ways to raise the revenues needed for poor countries to deal with the impacts of extreme weather, which will be continued at the Cop30 UN climate summit in Brazil next month.

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at the green campaigning organisation Seas at Risk, said: “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. No single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail, but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet does not have time to waste.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf90cc0d9c43a7420259c6ee8c74714f74e80733/457_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f3841056d8b21364e245225234d7a78",N,,2025-10-18 05:59:03.943342

Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.
“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.","U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday “nuclear is going to become sexy again” and he sees Utah playing a part in a comeback as the nation tries to raise its energy output to feed demand from artificial intelligence.

“We’re really going to see nuclear move again. Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.

Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.

He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.

“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said.

With nuclear projects coming to Utah, Cox hopes for rural jobs, but that’s no easy task

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.

Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County.

Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.

Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.

“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.

Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running.

“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.

Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly described AES Indiana’s original base rate request as being for $293 million.","AES Indiana slashed its $193-million base rate increase request by more than half — to $91 million — in a settlement agreement filed with state regulators on Wednesday.

“We have a deep commitment to operating efficiently and keeping rates as low as possible,” utility President Brandi Davis-Handy said in a news release. “Throughout this process, we’ve listened to stakeholder feedback and evaluated tradeoffs we will make for future investments while minimizing the financial impact of delivering safe and reliable electric service.”

The proposed deal is with Indiana University and the city of Indianapolis, plus a variety of companies: Allison Transmission, Eli Lilly & Co., Rolls-Royce, Walmart and more. Kroger wasn’t part of the deal but has no objection to it, according to the filing.

The matter is before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, and won’t be decided until next year.

Indiana Utility Consumer Counselor Abby Gray and her office, as well as pro-ratepayer group Citizens Action Coalition, didn’t sign on.

“The settlement agreement filed by AES and other parties shows the utility’s initial request was inflated and unnecessary,” Gray said in a Thursday news release. “The OUCC stands by its initial recommendations for a reduction from current rates and will oppose the utility’s settlement agreement.”

State’s ratepayer advocate recommends denial of AES’ $200M proposed increase

Her office recommended last month that the IURC deny AES Indiana’s request — and, instead, said a $21 million cut to current rates is “warranted” based on the case‘s evidence and the law.

Citizens Action Coalition, meanwhile, called the proposal “unbalanced.”

“We will vigorously oppose this unfair and unaffordable deal and do everything we can to protect the residents of Indianapolis from yet another large utility bill increase,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a Thursday news release. “Hoosiers have had enough with AES Indiana’s poor service, soaring bills, and backroom deals. It’s time for the IURC to send a message and restore affordability and accountability at our out-of-control monopoly utilities.”

The proposed settlement

AES Indiana provides retail electric service to more than 530,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indianapolis, as well as portions of other central Indiana communities surrounding Marion County

The agreement would lower the revenue requirement AES Indiana seeks from $2.1 billion to $2 billion, and lists other changes — to the cost of capital, fuel oil inventory, depreciation, vegetation management and more — that go into the revenue figure.

The utility also agreed not to implement new base rates arising out of its next case until 2030, after the current base rate request is carried out.

And the company would delay the start of its next proposed transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge plan until 2028. The current plan enters its final year in 2026.

“For over a decade, AES Indiana has consistently ranked among the lowest residential rates in the state, and that’s not by chance,” Davis-Handy said. “Despite rising costs, we have been disciplined in our planning through measures like our operations and maintenance costs holding flat for the past five years.”

Some of the agreement’s terms affect specific parties, like streetlight provisions involving the city of Indianapolis or discussions about “ways to ameliorate the peaks associated with Rolls-Royce’s engine testing.”

Story continues below.

The document goes on to tackle the cost of service and rate design.

“The Settling Parties agree that rates should be designed in order to allocate the revenue requirement to and among AES Indiana’s customer classes in a fair and reasonable manner,” it reads.

The subsidy received by residential customers would be “mitigated” by 15%, according to the agreement. Fixed charges would stay at their current, regulator-approved levels: $12.50 monthly at 325 kilowatt hours or less, and $17 monthly for residents using more power.

Large secondary service customers would pay a $128 charge and a demand charge of $28.50.

Citizens Action Coalition said the deal would result in residential customers receiving a 6.51% base rate increase, whereas primary and secondary classes of large commercial and industrial customers would “only” receive a 3.19% and 4.12% increase, respectively.

The advocacy organization also critiqued the arrangement for “fail(ing) to adequately address” the “egregious and prolonged” problems tens of thousands of customers experienced after AES rolled out a new billing system in 2023.

Regulators can approve, deny, or modify any settlement agreement they consider. But the document says that — if the IURC doesn’t accept the proposed deal in its entirety — it’ll be null, void and withdrawn upon written notice of “unacceptable modifications” by any of the settling parties.

Data centers not part of the equation

AES Indiana also filed rebuttals this month to earlier criticisms.

In their response to the initial increase ask, OUCC witnesses labeled the utility “inattentive” and “indifferent” when it comes to affordability.

“While the OUCC may disagree with the Company on policy matters, the suggestion that differing viewpoints constitute wrongdoing should be rejected,” Davis-Handy said in her rebuttal.

She argued that AES Indiana can’t control much of the increase it seeks.

“Rate reviews are driven by facts and require sound analysis,” Davis-Handy said. “This is necessary because the price charged for retail electric service is underpinned by the cost incurred to provide the service, and the reality is that much of the cost incurred by the Company to provide service is outside the Company’s control.”

She pointed to the utility’s “relatively flat” non-fuel, non-labor operations and management expenses as proof of “reasonable and sound management of costs that are under the Company’s control.”

Davis-Handy also rejected claims that power-hungry data centers are behind the rate increase request, testifying that AES Indiana doesn’t have any data center customers right now and that data center load is “in no way associated with” the proposed hike.

The OUCC pledged to submit opposition testimony “on a future date to be determined.” The settlement agreement includes a request to change the case’s filing schedule, but notes the “non-settling parties” haven’t agreed to the revisions.

Parties will have the opportunity to file testimony in support or opposition to the deal, after which the IURC will hold an evidentiary hearing.

AES Indiana hopes regulators will finalize the case in the spring, so that it can implement new rates by June 1, 2026.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: A Growth Story with Nuances In summary, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX) presents a compelling, albeit nuanced, growth story within the building materials industry.","Nashville, TN – As the North American housing market continues to navigate complex economic currents, investors are keenly assessing the long-term growth prospects of key players in the building materials sector. Among them, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX), a leading manufacturer of high-performance building materials and engineered wood products, stands at a critical juncture. With its stock currently trading around the low $90s as of mid-October 2025, the central question for many is whether LPX possesses the fundamental strength and market catalysts to double its share price within the next five years. This article delves into the company's current performance, strategic initiatives, market dynamics, and expert forecasts to provide a comprehensive outlook on its potential trajectory.

A Deep Dive into LPX's Growth Engine and Market Headwinds

Louisiana Pacific Corporation's business model is anchored by two primary segments: its highly successful Siding Solutions (including SmartSide and ExpertFinish products) and its Oriented Strand Board (OSB) offerings. As of October 2025, the company's strategy is heavily skewed towards capitalizing on the robust demand for its Siding products, which are lauded for their energy efficiency, weather resistance, and design flexibility. The anticipated above-market volume growth in the SmartSide business, fueled by successful new product developments and enhanced brand visibility, is a significant driver of LPX's positive long-term outlook. Notably, sales of its ExpertFinish products have demonstrated a strong 20% year-over-year growth, indicating expanding market share among repair and remodel contractors, further solidified by a strategic partnership with homebuilder Lennar. Improvements in pre-finishing efficiencies are also expected to bolster profitability within this segment.

Financially, LPX reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.99 for the Second Quarter of 2025, surpassing consensus estimates, despite a 7.2% year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue to $755 million. The divergence in segment performance is stark: Siding net sales surged by $45 million (11%) to $460 million, while OSB net sales plummeted by $101 million to $250 million. This trend is expected to continue into Q3 2025, with Siding net sales projected at $430 million (3% year-over-year growth) and a healthy Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. Conversely, the OSB segment is forecasted to record a negative Adjusted EBITDA of around $45 million, highlighting ongoing challenges in this commodity-driven business. For the full year 2025, LPX anticipates Siding net sales of approximately $1.7 billion (9% growth) with a robust 25% Adjusted EBITDA margin, while OSB is expected to remain in negative Adjusted EBITDA territory. The company plans significant capital expenditures of around $350 million for the year, signaling continued investment in its growth initiatives.

However, LPX's journey is not without considerable risks. Its substantial exposure to the cyclical North American housing market makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, which could lead to decreased demand and pricing pressure for its products. Volatility in energy and freight costs also poses a threat to earnings. Investor concerns are further compounded by competitor commentary hinting at potential volume declines due to inventory destocking, drawing parallels to the negative market performance observed in 2022 and 2023. As of mid-October 2025, LPX's stock has traded between $90.26 and $93.02, having delivered a -15.0% total return over the past 12 months. While short-term technical indicators show mixed signals, a ""Golden Star Signal"" issued in July 2025 on the long-term chart suggests potential for future gains. Insider sentiment is neutral, though hedge funds own a significant 94.73% of the stock, with recent purchases indicating increased institutional interest.

The Competitive Landscape: Winners and Losers in LPX's Shadow

The potential for Louisiana Pacific (NYSE: LPX) to achieve significant growth, possibly doubling its stock value, would undoubtedly send ripples through the competitive and interconnected building materials industry. LPX's primary competitors include giants like Weyerhaeuser (NYSE: WY), Boise Cascade (NYSE: BCC), West Fraser Timber (NYSE: WFG), and smaller specialized manufacturers.

If LPX's Siding Solutions continue their strong growth trajectory and gain substantial market share, competitors offering similar exterior building products could face increased pressure. Companies heavily invested in traditional siding materials or those without LPX's innovative product lineup might see their market positions erode. LPX's strategic partnership with Lennar, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, also gives it a competitive edge, potentially diverting business from other suppliers to Lennar and other homebuilders. Conversely, if LPX's OSB segment struggles to recover profitability, it might open opportunities for competitors like Weyerhaeuser and West Fraser Timber, which also have significant OSB operations, to gain market share or improve their margins in that specific product category.

Beyond direct competitors, related industries would also feel the effects. Homebuilders, for instance, could benefit from LPX's innovations, potentially leading to more cost-effective or aesthetically pleasing construction options, thereby enhancing their own offerings. Suppliers of raw materials to LPX could see increased demand, while those supplying competing manufacturers might experience stagnation. The entire ecosystem of contractors, distributors, and retailers dealing in building materials would need to adapt to LPX's market movements, potentially favoring its products if its growth continues. The dynamic interplay of product innovation, market share shifts, and raw material costs will dictate who ultimately wins or loses in the wake of LPX's future performance.

Broader Industry Trends and Historical Context

Louisiana Pacific's growth potential is inextricably linked to broader industry trends, particularly the health of the North American housing market. Factors such as housing starts, mortgage interest rates, and the availability of affordable housing significantly influence demand for building materials. As of October 2025, the market is grappling with fluctuating interest rates and persistent supply chain challenges, creating a complex environment for homebuilders and material suppliers alike. LPX's strong emphasis on its Siding Solutions, which cater to both new construction and the robust repair and remodel (R&R) market, positions it strategically to weather some of the volatility in new housing starts. The R&R segment tends to be more resilient during housing market slowdowns, offering a degree of insulation.

The push towards sustainable building practices and energy-efficient materials also plays directly into LPX's strengths. Products like SmartSide are often marketed with environmental benefits and durability, aligning with evolving consumer preferences and stricter building codes. This trend could create ripple effects, encouraging competitors to invest more in similar eco-friendly innovations or risk being left behind. Regulatory or policy changes related to forestry, carbon emissions, or construction standards could also significantly impact LPX and its peers. For instance, increased regulations on timber harvesting could drive up raw material costs, while incentives for green building could boost demand for LPX's specific product lines.

Historically, the building materials sector has been cyclical, closely mirroring economic cycles. Companies that have successfully navigated these cycles and achieved substantial long-term growth have often done so through strategic diversification, continuous innovation, and efficient cost management. The early 2000s saw a boom in housing, followed by a significant downturn, demonstrating the sector's sensitivity. Companies that emerged stronger focused on high-value products and operational resilience. LPX's current strategy of prioritizing its higher-margin Siding segment over the more commodity-driven OSB segment reflects an adaptation to these historical lessons, aiming to build a more stable and profitable business model less susceptible to the extreme swings of raw material prices.

What Comes Next: Navigating Opportunities and Challenges

Looking ahead, Louisiana Pacific (NYSE: LPX) faces a pivotal period that will determine its ability to achieve significant stock appreciation. In the short term, investors will be closely watching the company's Third Quarter 2025 earnings release on November 5, 2025. The performance of the Siding segment, particularly its ability to meet or exceed projected sales and Adjusted EBITDA, will be crucial. Any signs of stabilization or improvement in the OSB segment, even if it remains in negative EBITDA, could also be viewed positively. Beyond earnings, macroeconomic indicators such as housing starts, existing home sales, and interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve will heavily influence market sentiment towards LPX and the broader building materials sector.

In the long term, LPX's strategic pivots will be key. Continued investment in research and development to expand its Siding Solutions product portfolio, coupled with aggressive market penetration strategies, will be essential. The partnership with Lennar is a strong foundation, but securing similar relationships with other major homebuilders could significantly accelerate growth. Operational efficiency improvements, particularly in pre-finishing processes for Siding, will be vital for margin expansion. Furthermore, exploring opportunities for international expansion or diversification into related, less cyclical building material niches could provide additional avenues for growth and risk mitigation. Potential strategic acquisitions that complement its Siding business or enhance its technological capabilities cannot be ruled out.

Several scenarios could unfold for LPX. In an optimistic scenario, a rebound in the North American housing market, coupled with sustained demand for its innovative Siding products and effective cost management, could propel the stock towards doubling its value within five years. Forecasts from Walletinvestor.com, predicting LPX to reach $149.695 by October 2030 (a 65.57% increase), and StockScan, forecasting an average price of $125.23 by 2030, suggest such a possibility, though the ""doubling"" target implies a more aggressive growth rate than these specific forecasts. A more conservative scenario might see steady but moderate growth, driven by the R&R market, but constrained by persistent housing market headwinds and OSB segment challenges. A pessimistic outlook would involve a prolonged housing downturn, significant increases in input costs, and a failure to effectively expand its Siding market share, leading to stagnation or decline.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: A Growth Story with Nuances

In summary, Louisiana Pacific Corporation (NYSE: LPX) presents a compelling, albeit nuanced, growth story within the building materials industry. The company's strategic focus on its high-growth, high-margin Siding Solutions business, particularly SmartSide and ExpertFinish, is a clear differentiator and the primary engine for future appreciation. Strong year-over-year growth in ExpertFinish sales, coupled with strategic partnerships and efficiency gains, underscore the segment's potential. However, the persistent drag from its commodity-driven OSB segment and the inherent cyclicality of the North American housing market remain significant headwinds that investors must carefully consider.

Moving forward, the market will closely scrutinize LPX's ability to continue expanding its Siding market share, innovate its product offerings, and manage operational costs effectively. While analyst sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with an average ""Hold"" rating and price targets suggesting a decent upside, achieving a doubling of the stock price within five years will require not only sustained execution on its Siding strategy but also a favorable macroeconomic environment, particularly a resilient or recovering housing sector. The substantial ownership by hedge funds indicates institutional confidence, but insider selling activity provides a mixed signal.

Investors should watch for upcoming earnings reports, paying close attention to Siding segment growth metrics and any signs of improvement or further deterioration in the OSB business. Furthermore, monitoring broader economic indicators such as housing starts, interest rate trends, and consumer spending on home improvements will provide critical context for LPX's performance. The company's capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases and investments in growth projects, will also be important indicators of management's confidence and strategic direction. While the path to doubling its stock value is challenging, LPX's strong position in the resilient Siding market provides a foundation for substantial long-term growth, making it a stock to watch in the coming months and years.
