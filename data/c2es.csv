This strategic growth demonstrates BPP’s capability across the energy value chain—from upstream energy generation to midstream power trading and downstream power retail—enhancing long-term value and revenue generation.

This approach reflects the company’s commitment to its “Pioneering Energy, Empowering Tomorrow” stance and supports its new missions to enhance capabilities and seize emerging opportunities in a rapidly evolving global energy landscape. BPP reported strong H1/2025 results, with performance driven by its power plants in the U.S. and China, as well as increased revenue from carbon emission allowances (CEAs).

Mr. Issara Niropas, CEO of Banpu Power PCL (BPP), stated, “In today’s world, where energy security underpins economic stability and national security, BPP is committed not only to advancing energy generation, but also to creating added value through power trading in the U.S. via our subsidiary, BPPUS. Leveraging digital expertise, data-driven insights, and a dedicated professional team, this milestone enables us to generate revenue from congestion revenue rights (CRR). Since launching the CRR business in Q4 last year through H1/2025, we have achieved over THB 133 million in revenue.

We are also preparing to expand into the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) market to generate income through proprietary trading, forecasting electricity price movements. This will complement our core power generation business, which continues to deliver strong cash flow. Additionally, through BKV Energy, our U.S. power retail arm established through a collaboration between BPPUS and BKV Corporation, we have been recognized as ‘Best Electricity Company’ at the 2025 Best of the Best Awards by the Houston Chronicle, based on votes from Texas consumers. This recognition reflects trust in the quality and reliability of our power supply at affordable pricing.”

Highlights from BPP’s H1/2025 performance are as follows.

BPP recorded a net profit of THB 1,846 million, an 11% increase year-on-year, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) totaling THB 4,486 million. Key drivers include improved performance at Temple I and Temple II gas-fired power plants in the U.S., gains from change in fair value of financial instruments due to hedging contracts secured at favorable prices, efficient coal cost management at combined heat and power (CHP) plants in China, and higher revenue from the sale of CEAs.

Thermal Energy Business: In China, the Zhengding power plant began commercial operations in June, utilizing biomass co-firing at a 10% blend ratio with the primary fuel, an initiative expected to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 70,000 tons per year. At the Zouping plant, construction of a northern steam pipeline began in July, with further expansion under study to extend the network east and west, ensuring a more stable and cost-efficient steam supply to local industries. Meanwhile, the HPC power plant in Lao PDR and the BLCP power plant in Thailand continued to maintain high equivalent availability factor (EAF) of 89% and 90%, respectively.

Renewables+ Business: In Japan, the Iwate Tono battery farm project, with a power capacity of 14.5 MW and an energy storage capacity of 58 MWh, achieved commercial operations in June. BPP continues to scale its battery energy storage system (BESS) business in Japan through Banpu NEXT, in which BPP holds a 50% stake, aiming to become a key player in Japan’s BESS market. Simultaneously, the company is assessing the feasibility of expanding its BESS investment into the U.S. market.

BPP has also introduced three missions to drive sustainable growth and align with the dynamic nature of the global energy transition:

Accelerate growth through digital innovation, global operational expertise, and strategic investments in global initiatives.

Advance the sustainable energy transition by embracing advanced technologies and innovations to drive decarbonization, while reinforcing future energy reliability.

Enhance quality of life through community development initiatives spanning education, healthcare, and post-disaster recovery, creating long-term positive change.

“Over nearly three decades, BPP has established itself in eight strategic markets as a pioneer in energy. This journey reflects our ability to balance the energy equation through portfolio diversification, asset optimization, and continuous decarbonization—delivering high-quality, reliable energy along with steady returns for all our stakeholders,” Mr. Issara concluded.",https://www.kaohooninternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BPP_2025-08-25_news.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:03:49.382479

Essentially, they are writing terms of service for when large data centers move into their areas and buy their electricity.
Ameren is proposing these requirements for data centers: Sign contracts for a minimum of 15 years of service.
Why this is important Extreme energy use Data centers represent a potentially unprecedented increase in energy use, according to Ameren.
Companies that are building huge data centers, like Amazon and Google, have officially joined the cases in Missouri meaning they will weigh in during proceedings.","In St. Charles this month, crowds of people opposing a proposed large data center showed up to public meetings to voice their concerns.

They decried the secretive nature of the project, whose owner still hasn’t been revealed, and its potential impact on water quality.

The residents were also worried that their energy bills might go up because of the data center’s potentially huge demand for electricity. The developer pulled the proposal for now but says it will be back.

In the meantime, Missouri’s biggest utilities, including Ameren, are working to write new rules to govern how large data centers operate in the state. Advocates hope the new policies could also protect regular utility customers, like the ones who showed up in St. Charles.

What’s happening

Two of Missouri’s largest utilities, Ameren in the east and Evergy in the west, are both in the middle of Large Load Customer Tariff cases before Missouri’s utility regulator, the Public Service Commission. Essentially, they are writing terms of service for when large data centers move into their areas and buy their electricity.

This process was spurred, in part, by the Missouri legislature passing a new utility law in March. SB4 requires large utilities to write tariffs, which are effectively terms of service, for customers requesting more than 100 megawatts of energy, to make sure that existing customers' rates don’t reflect any “unjust or unreasonable” cost.

In filings before the PSC, Ameren representatives write that they are trying to balance two goals: attracting these new data center businesses and doing it in a way that minimizes risk.

“We need to have a framework where we can actually get some assurance about their commitment to the region before we make the investments in some of the infrastructure we need to serve them,” said Steve Wills, senior director of regulatory affairs for Ameren Missouri.

To attract the businesses, the utilities are offering to build new power plants to meet their large energy demands, write clear policies for large customers and create subscription programs for renewable energy.

To minimize risk, the utilities are making rules to protect other customers from footing the bill if the data centers don’t actually move in, or if they leave early. Ameren is proposing these requirements for data centers:

Sign contracts for a minimum of 15 years of service.

Commit to buying a minimum level of energy that is 70% of what they are contracted for.

Post collateral or have a minimum credit rating to come in.

Give two years' notice before terminating their agreements and would have to pay exit fees that would cover their minimum demand obligations for at least five years or the rest of their contract.

Ameren also wants data centers to sign Electric Service Agreements that would be approved by the Public Service Commission, giving state regulators a say over the terms of these data center agreements.

Why this is important

Extreme energy use

Data centers represent a potentially unprecedented increase in energy use, according to Ameren.

“They're really unique in terms of their service characteristics,” Wills said. “And by unique, I mean, it's really just the size of them. They're very, very large.”

In 2024, the largest individual Ameren customer had a peak electricity demand of 32MW. The company is writing these policies for customers requesting 100MW or more.

These rules will likely apply mostly to large data centers, but there is a possibility that other large industrial customers might need this level of service.

In its filings, Ameren said it already has large energy customers knocking at its doors, and some have taken steps to commit their business. The company has five projects that would fall under this Large Load Rate Plan, totaling 2,270MW of demand, and that have taken steps to commit to build.

That level of new energy demand will necessitate new energy sources, like power plants. So Ameren would need to build.

In most cases, costs for new power plants and other infrastructure are spread out among all customers through rate increases. But in this case, the investments are so large, the utilities need to make sure the data centers foot the bill for infrastructure that is only going in because of their demand.

“We're going to do everything that we possibly can to reasonably ensure that these customers are paying their fair share, and that we're not unjustly passing costs on to other customers,” said Rob Dixon, Ameren’s senior director for economic, community and business development.

If the rules are set up well, there is a possibility that these huge new customers could lower costs for everyone, said Geoff Marke, chief economist with Missouri Office of Public Counsel, the ratepayer advocate before the Public Service Commission.

“Over time, in theory, it should lower the overall bills for customers if it's done correctly,” Marke said. “It's really an economy of scale argument more than anything, and an argument for utilities period is bigger is better in terms of being able to spread out cost and investments.”

Speculative nature

The speculative nature of data centers represents a uniquely risky situation for utilities and their customers, said Jeremy Fisher, the Sierra Club’s principal adviser for climate and energy.

As companies shop around for data center locations, they’re asking utilities for information in multiple places. Fisher said the Sierra Club is tracking 23 utilities that have announced 700 gigawatts of demand in their economic development pipelines, which would represent more power than the U.S. currently uses.

“It is ridiculous to imagine that the data center sector is going to consume more electricity than all Americans consume today,” Fisher added.

Even if they do move in, data centers could ultimately need less energy than they are signaling now. Fisher said there are two factors that could lead to less demand — artificial intelligence could become significantly more efficient, and the companies could end up not succeeding in their market.

Marke said there have been examples in Missouri of large businesses going under and leading to increased energy costs for all customers, like in the case of an aluminum smelter in New Madrid. He worries that could happen with AI, too.

“The AI, the data centers themselves, are part of a competitive marketplace,” said Marke. “So there's no guarantee that each data center, each vendor, AI application, is ultimately going to be successful.”

If data centers don’t end up needing all the energy utilities think they do, it could leave those energy providers without a use or a way to pay for new, expensive power plants. That’s where these large load tariffs could provide protections.

“One of the really positive things about having a large load tariff is that it ensures that the utility isn't building generation and transmission infrastructure on spec, but actually relying on a real market signal before it invests,” Fisher said.

Climate implications

These cases will also potentially have big implications for the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change because energy generation is the second-largest source of those emissions in the U.S.

The huge increase in energy use could be “effectively a rollback of our climate progress as utilities increasingly invest in gas and existing coal to meet those requirements,” Fisher said.

In testimony before the Public Service Commission, Ameren officials repeatedly emphasize that data center customers want renewable energy to power their operations. Dixon wrote that 35% of Ameren’s largest customers have sustainability goals, and large data center operators like Amazon and Google also prioritize renewable energy.

That spurred Ameren to propose four new subscription programs for large load customers to pay extra to receive wind, solar or nuclear energy.

But at the same time, Ameren has announced it will build two new natural gas plants in the coming years and more after that. Natural gas is cleaner than coal but still relies on fossil fuels and contributes to climate change.

Wills said natural gas is needed to fill in the gaps when renewable sources like solar and wind aren’t on.

“You really need to capitalize on the strengths of every different technology that's out there,” Wills said. “And so the natural gas generation is what we call dispatchable, which means it's available on demand.”

In testimony, Ajay Arora, Ameren’s senior vice president and chief development officer, said the company’s plan is to get 70% of its energy from sources that can be turned on immediately, like natural gas or nuclear. The remaining 30% would come from renewables like wind and solar.

What’s next

As both large load rate cases make their way through the regulatory process, outside parties are weighing in on the initial proposals from the utilities and sharing opinions on what they should look like.

Companies that are building huge data centers, like Amazon and Google, have officially joined the cases in Missouri meaning they will weigh in during proceedings. The Sierra Club and Renew Missouri have also done the same. And the case will include input from the Office of Public Counsel, which represents customers in Missouri.

These outside parties will push back, asking for changes in the policies. For example, in Evergy’s case, Marke with the Office of Public Counsel has testified that these data centers should be subject to studies that look at energy efficiency, water use and how data centers might disturb the flow of electricity in the area before and after they are built.

“Right now, I would argue that a lot of this isn't very transparent,” Marke said. “So getting that information out there, making that a priority on the front end, allows us to go ahead and benchmark it, allows us to better plan our finite resources moving forward.”

Much like with a case in a court, briefs will be filed, evidentiary hearings will be held, and eventually the Public Service Commission will approve plans.

Evergy’s case could be on the PSC’s agenda at the end of this year, and Ameren’s will likely come up in the beginning of next year.

Once fully operational, the project would power 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Freezing wind is in the economic forecast

Nearly $19 billion worth of renewable energy projects have been canceled this year, a 2,149% increase from last year, according to the Financial Times, citing Atlas Public Policy data. And that’s how the Trump administration wants it:

Last week, on Truth Social, President Trump posted, “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar.”

In April, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum temporarily halted New York’s $5 billion Empire Wind project, led by Equinor, but changed course after fierce lobbying from Gov. Kathy Hochul.

How’s business? The Oceantic Network, a trade group for the renewable energy industry, criticized the Trump administration’s move to halt the Rhode Island project for putting American jobs at risk, saying in a statement that Revolution Wind “sparked investments in Louisiana and New England shipyards, the purchase of export cables from a South Carolina factory, and spurred a steel supply chain that crossed New York and created hundreds of union jobs in Providence, Rhode Island.”

It’s also another blow to Ørsted, whose financial health was already declining. Before this news, it was trying to raise $9.4 billion to improve its balance sheet, as doing business in the US got a whole lot tougher in the past year.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/d0594bd488a9ccfc42b300794ebb2616e0e1e27c-8136x5424.jpg?rect=0,576,8136,4271&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-08-25 07:04:47.558952

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy.
Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption.
Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse.
This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.","A Tennessee department head is hopeful that new guidance for a federal program supporting the growth of electric vehicle charging networks may ultimately allow the state to proceed with $21 million in contracts that have been frozen since February.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy. 64, which runs from Memphis to Pelham roughly along Tennessee’s southern border. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) awarded $21 million of the funding to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, each with ports to charge several vehicles, but the contracts were not executed before the federal program’s pause.

Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption. Tennessee’s EV manufacturing industry has grown over the last several years – often supported by state incentives to bring hundreds of jobs to rural communities – giving the state an economic interest in the vehicles’ success. Ford’s new BlueOval City facility in rural West Tennessee recently delayed mass production of its full-size electric truck until 2028 as the company refocuses on the production of cheaper, smaller models in Kentucky.

The $5 billion NEVI program has officially been on ice since February 2025, when the U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended funding to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to pause federal grants supporting electric vehicles and clean energy.

Multiple states have challenged the Trump administration’s ability to freeze the funds in federal court. Tennessee is not among them.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy recently released interim guidance for the program intending to “streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape,” according to the federal transportation department.

States can reapply for funding under the new requirements over the next 30 days.

Tennessee program makes progress on EV chargers while frozen federal projects languish

Tennessee Department of Transportation Director Beth Emmons said the department is reviewing the new guidance and updated requirements and “hopes to have a path forward with this program by the time the guidelines become official.”

The program’s deployment has been slow. Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse. The federal government allocated $3.3 billion to states for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Of the 38 states that have issued awards under previously approved plans (which must now be resubmitted), 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded a total $544 million.

The revised guidance went into effect on Aug. 13, and the Federal Highway Administration is accepting comments on the rule changes through Aug. 27.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement released Aug. 11. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises … While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Changes include scrapping language regarding serving “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities,” “equitable distribution,” and opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses. The guidance also removes requirements for states to “address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.”

Charging industry coalition welcomes changes, nonprofit says new requirements are another stall tactic

Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition supporting a nationwide EV charging network, welcomed the new guidance.

Slow uptake by states in NEVI’s first three years was due to “requirements within the original guidance that slowed down deployment,” according to a coalition statement released Aug. 13.

“The ultimate goal of the NEVI program is to expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure, and these updated guidelines will make that outcome more likely,” Charge Ahead Partnership Executive Director Jay Smith said. “A streamlined NEVI program will make it easier for the mom-and-pop gas station on the corner, along with national retail chains, to offer EV charging.”

The coalition is particularly optimistic about guidance encouraging states to prioritize applicants who will serve as the site host and charging provider, a move they say will cut down on time that would otherwise be spent searching for a site, and allow for simpler accountability.

The Sierra Club, one of several nonprofit groups that have joined legal challenges against the funding freeze, contends that the new guidance is “unnecessary” and serves only to further delay EV charging buildout as states reapply for funds.

“It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine Garcia stated in a news release.

“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging.”

Separate state program continues charger rollout

In the meantime, Tennessee’s separately funded Fast Charge TN program has supported EV charger installation in a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga.

The state program is powered by money from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. It aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways.

Under Fast Charge TN’s first round, 35 charging sites are operational and 18 more are under development.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which oversees the Fast Charge TN program, announced on Friday that it will extend its application period for the second round of funding through Sept. 19 at 4 p.m.

As electric vehicle adoption rises, more Americans will need to clean out their garages.
They are one of three main electric vehicle charging types.
Not owning your own home then “presents a substantial complication to installing EV charging,” Abuelsamid said.
Cox initially estimated July EV sales to be the second-best month ever, with sales over 130,000 vehicles representing a 20% year-over-year increase.","Not owning your own home presents a substantial complication to installing EV charging, according to Telemetry.

Installing in-home chargers can cost on average $2,000.

As electric vehicle adoption rises, more Americans will need to clean out their garages.

This, according to a Michigan-based strategic communications agency's first 2025 EV Charging Market report, is because home charging systems are crucial to courting higher EV sales, and a surprising number of car buyers lack access to a 240-volt outlet close enough to where their car is parked.

While the majority of American homes can support such an outlet, the agency, Telemetry, found that one-third of American homeowners with garages can’t park there.

“You can have a charger outside your garage, or if you don’t have a garage at all, you can get chargers that are mounted outside, they aren’t that much more expensive,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for the agency. Abuelsamid is an analyst with over 11 years of experience conducting similar reports.

""Or, you can adjust your behavior at home and move your stuff,” he added.

The study, compiled by Telemetry using a combination of proprietary forecasting, government data resources from the U.S. and Canada, external industry analysis and journalistic citations, also found:

Direct-current fast chargers make up less than 3.85% of chargers in private networks across the U.S. and Canada and can cost up to $70,000 to install.

Telemetry’s Light Duty Vehicle Forecast projects that EVs are set to represent between 20% and 44% of all new vehicle sales in North America by 2035, a range of 33 million to 57 million EVs.

If electric vehicles rise to reach that market range, a low of 4.7 million and a high of 31.9 million homeowners would need to install at-home chargers by 2035.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated 42% of homeowners park near existing electrical access that can be modified to work with a Level 2 charger, Telemetry said Aug. 20, noting that the number surges to 68% if homeowners opt to clear out their garage.

Level 2 chargers are found at most public charging stations and are considered the best for at-home charging systems too. They are one of three main electric vehicle charging types. A Level 1 charger, is similar to plugging in a lamp, and takes roughly 20 hours to charge 120 miles. Level 3 fast chargers, meanwhile, can charge an electric vehicle most of the way in less than a half hour.

Financial, structural hurdles

Other findings of the study indicate that electric vehicle ownership still favors Americans who own their homes. Home charging makes up 80% of all electric vehicle charging today, which makes sense, as over 80% of all EV owners own their homes.

“The vast majority of people do not buy new cars and nearly 90% of all EVs on the road were built in the past seven years,” Abuelsamid said. “The people that are buying new cars tend to be a little more affluent.”

Roughly three out of four southeastern Michigan occupied housing units — homes and apartments where people live — had access to a garage or carport in 2023, according to the American Housing Survey of the Census Bureau. But one in four renter households in Michigan spent more than half of their income in 2023 to cover housing costs, which includes rent and utilities.

Not owning your own home then “presents a substantial complication to installing EV charging,” Abuelsamid said.

Data from the U.S. Census Bureau notes that owner-occupied housing in the city of Detroit was 54% in 2023, the latest data available, to 137,567 out of a total 255,857 units. Across Michigan, the owner-occupied housing rates are higher, reaching 73.7% in 2023.

Residential charging remains a challenge for roughly 23% of Americans who rent multifamily residences, such as apartments, according to Telemetry. Of the 20% of new EV purchasers who live in multifamily homes, just 11% report parking near charging access at their residence.

Even for those who own their own homes, the cost of upgrading electrical access for vehicle use may be prohibitive, Abuelsamid pointed out. Older homes may run on limited 100 amp circuit breakers, and the preferred voltage use for adequate home charging can be a substantial drain.

For those with very short commutes, Abuelsamid said, plugging into a standard 120-volt outlet, which adds maybe a mile or two an hour, “might be all you need.”

For those who need more range, upgrades to a home's electrical system could be necessary, and even more expensive if the circuit breaker isn't close enough to where you plan to charge the car.

“If it’s in close proximity to your garage or where you’re going to park, it’s relatively straightforward,” Abuelsamid said. “But if your breaker panel is on the opposite end of your house, that could add hundreds of dollars to the cost of installation just for the wire. If you have to upgrade your panel, now you’re talking potentially thousands of dollars to do that.”

EV sales are soaring

Despite these barriers, Telemetry estimated U.S. EV market share will more than double in 10 years. That is, over 40% of all new vehicle sales a decade from now could be electric, comprising 20% of total sales compared with today’s less than 10%. In the U.S., there are about 305 million registered vehicles, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

EV sales surged this summer due to the upcoming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit after President Donald Trump slashed clean vehicle tax credits under what has been called the “One Big, Beautiful bill.”

Cox Automotive cited an uptick in sales last month as car buyers raced to take advantage of discounts to reach some of the highest new and used EV sales on record. Cox initially estimated July EV sales to be the second-best month ever, with sales over 130,000 vehicles representing a 20% year-over-year increase.

EV adoption is moving slower than automakers anticipated and hasn’t meaningfully grown industrywide outside the current spike, according to Lenny LaRocca, U.S. auto leader at KPMG, the audit, tax and advisory firm.

Even with some of the new launches, “EVs are not at price points the mass market is really excited about, and range anxiety is still a main hurdle to adoption,” LaRocca told the Free Press. “For longer trips, an EV is not the preferred choice right now. Without a reliable network of charging, it really limits the market.”

Across public and private networks in the U.S. and Canada, Telemetry expects installing the proper EV charging equipment to reach the demand expected in 2035 will cost $132.6 billion to $143.1 billion in today’s dollars.

Private homeowners can be expected to pay around $45.4 billion to $50.4 billion of that total, assuming an average of $2,000 per installed charger, the Telemetry study also found.

The move, which according to a person familiar with the matter will see about 200 of the nearly 300 jobs at the subsidiary cut, is a further blow to European efforts to challenge Asia's dominance in automotive battery manufacturing.

Cellforce will be turned into an independent research and development unit, the company said in a statement on Monday.

Even as European carmakers seek to transition to electric vehicles to cut greenhouse gas emissions, hopes within industry and governments to foster a battery supply chain in Europe were frustrated by the collapse of Swedish EV battery maker Northvolt this year.

Porsche said in April it would no longer pursue plans to expand production at Cellforce. It had planned to construct a ""start-up factory"" in the southwest German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2022, to be followed by a larger second location.

Were residents sidelined?,"Hailey Branson-Potts, www.latimes.com, hailey-branson-potts",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-25/battery-solar-project-darden-fresno-county-community-impacts,"But in rural western Fresno County — where energy firms have planned multiple large-scale battery and solar projects — many residents feel blindsided.
The stakes are big near Darden, including for Newsom’s plans to expedite other clean energy projects.
Intersect’s community benefits spending, she said, is “going directly to highly reputable nonprofits” and community-based organizations that will focus on western Fresno County.
Intersect Power and the Fresno County Fire Protection District said they are still negotiating fire mitigation measures.
Even so, the fire protection district said it will need to build four new stations and hire additional staff as more large clean energy projects are built.","The fallowed farmland — too dry, salty and barren to grow crops — stretches across a remote, sunbaked expanse crisscrossed by rutted dirt roads.

Soon, roughly 15 square miles of these retired agricultural fields in western Fresno County will hold one of the world’s largest solar and battery energy storage projects — a behemoth capable of powering some 850,000 homes for four hours.

The Darden Clean Energy Project, approved by the California Energy Commission in June, is the first development to be fast-tracked under a 2022 state law that allows large renewable energy projects to be reviewed and permitted without sign-off from county and municipal governments.

The Opt-In Certification Program, as it is called, is meant to sidestep the kind of local pushback that can drag on for years. And the Darden project’s approval was touted by Gov. Gavin Newsom as a major victory in helping the state meet its ambitious climate goal of using 100% clean energy by 2045.

But in rural western Fresno County — where energy firms have planned multiple large-scale battery and solar projects — many residents feel blindsided. They have raised serious questions about who benefits and who gets left behind when major projects are fast-tracked.

Espi Sandoval, a board member for the nonprofit Rural Communities Rising, a western Fresno County advocacy group, said the impoverished, mostly Latino area has long been exploited by corporate agriculture and now is playing catch-up as it finds itself suddenly at the forefront of California’s energy transition.

“We’re forgotten by the government. Now we’ve got this private sector coming in with these huge solar panel farms,” said Sandoval, who has lived in western Fresno County since 1972. “I don’t want to see the same exploitation of our people.”

Within a few miles of the Darden site are several tiny farmworker towns, including Cantua Creek, Five Points and Three Rocks (also known as El Porvenir). The solar and lithium-ion battery project will be built within a census tract where more than a third of residents live in poverty — double the rate in Fresno County as a whole.

The nearby towns struggle with poor drinking water and air quality, extreme heat and lack of access to opportunity, dozens of environmental justice groups and community advocates wrote in a letter to Newsom and the Energy Commission as the project was being considered.

In its oversight of the Darden project, they wrote, the state “has the potential to either set the stage for an equitable, just transition or, conversely, to continue patterns of disinvestment in low-income communities of color.”

The Darden project’s owner, IP Darden I, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Intersect Power, is set to become the second-largest property tax payer in Fresno County, behind Pacific Gas and Electric. Intersect will pay at least $232 million to the county over the next decade, according to an economic impact report by the company.

The project also is projected to generate tens of millions of dollars in local sales tax, including through the purchase of construction equipment and materials, according to Intersect Power. The company said it will create more than 1,200 construction jobs while it is being built and 16 full-time operational jobs once it’s up and running.

Maria Pacheco, the mayor of Kerman, a small city northeast of the Darden site, wrote in a letter to the Energy Commission this spring that the project’s jobs and tax revenue will be transformative for the San Joaquin Valley. They will help provide “essential services and infrastructure improvements, directly benefiting the often-underserved west side,” she wrote.

The stakes are big near Darden, including for Newsom’s plans to expedite other clean energy projects. The Opt-In Certification Program requires environmental reviews to be completed within 270 days of a project application being deemed complete.

Eight other projects, from Imperial County in the south to Shasta County in the north, currently are pursuing approval through the opt-in process. And after significant local pushback, a developer that has been planning to build a lithium-ion battery storage facility on the site where Morro Bay’s iconic smokestacks stand pulled out of the municipal permitting process this spring, indicating it might pursue the state’s fast-track program.

As part of the fast-track process, Intersect Power was required to enter into at least one so-called “community benefits agreement” with a local organization and to provide tangible benefits to the region.

Intersect Power agreed to donate $2 million to local groups over the next 10 years and $5 million over the life of the project.

In a statement to The Times, Elizabeth Knowles, the head of community engagement for Intersect, said the company has been meeting with residents, schools and other local stakeholders since 2023. Intersect’s community benefits spending, she said, is “going directly to highly reputable nonprofits” and community-based organizations that will focus on western Fresno County.

Much of the initial $2 million will be split among Fresno-based nonprofits that work to build housing and reduce asthma and hunger. An Intersect donation to the nonprofit Centro la Familia Advocacy Services was used to give away 250 high-efficiency window air-conditioning units to households close to the Darden site this summer.

The company also agreed to give money to Westside Elementary School, about four miles southeast of the site, to support campus upgrades and efforts to build more local housing.

Some donations have raised eyebrows. An undisclosed amount of the Intersect Power donations also will fund two years of after-school piano lessons from the Steinway Piano Gallery of Fresno at Cantua Elementary School.

In an email to The Times, Felipe Piedra, superintendent of the Golden Plains Unified School District, which includes Cantua Elementary, said 98% of the school’s roughly 185 students qualify for free or reduced lunch and “are in need of additional support and resources.” He said “water and clean energy are a big priority” but did not answer questions about why funds were going toward piano lessons.

Intersect Power is donating an undisclosed amount to the nonprofit Tree Fresno, which plants shade trees to reduce the effects of extreme heat and air pollution.

Sandoval, a former member of the Kerman City Council and longtime teacher in nearby Tranquility, scoffed at the piano lessons and tree donation, noting that Cantua Elementary is across the street from an orchard. He said he was frustrated to see Intersect Power working primarily with Fresno-based nonprofits.

“This thing is dictated from the top,” he said. “How is the money going to filter down to the community? Property taxes? That’s going to the county. How can we get some of those benefits?”

In an email to The Times, Tree Fresno’s chief executive, Mona Cummings, said her organization was assessing the need for plantings at the elementary schools in Cantua Creek and Five Points and seeking more input from locals.

During a public meeting in Coalinga this April, Leticia Villegas, a farmworker from Five Points, told the Energy Commission that she lives three miles from where the Darden solar panels will be built. She said through a Spanish interpreter that she works in fields during the day, when the sun is baking, and comes back to a run-down home with no air conditioning.

She said she hopes money from the development will “go directly to our community.”

“Please,” she added, “we want to be listened to.”

Felipe Perez, a City Council member in nearby Firebaugh and a former fieldworker, said he used to pick crops near the Darden site. He said it was not easy seeing new industries arrive, “using soil that we used to use for ag.”

Perez, 56, who came to the U.S. from Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1988, said there are not as many field jobs as there once were, in part because of drought and out-of-town farmers selling their land.

“The question is, are they going to hire us?” he said of clean energy developers. “In what language are they going to teach us? And what are we going to do when they don’t help us and we still get those kind of bills?”

Construction on the Darden project is expected to begin by the end of this year, and it should be fully operational in late 2027 or early 2028, Knowles said.

It will be built on 9,500 acres sold by the Westlands Water District, the nation’s largest agricultural water district. Decades of farming and irrigation have degraded the soil, drawing salts and metals to the surface. That and the district’s uncertain water supplies have made the land impractical for farming, prompting Westlands to divert water to more productive land.

The Darden project — located near a major PG&E power line that can transmit electricity north or south — will include a 1,150-megawatt solar facility with approximately 3.1 million solar panels.

It also will have up to 1,150 megawatts of battery storage via 1,440 Tesla Megapack 2XL units — essentially shipping container-sized units filled with battery modules. Such battery systems store excess energy generated during the day and release it into the power grid during times of high demand, including evening hours.

But in western Fresno County, many residents have expressed concern about the lithium-ion batteries catching fire — a fear that intensified after a massive blaze in January tore through a battery energy storage system in Moss Landing, a rural community in coastal Monterey County.

That fire, which burned more than 54,000 LG battery modules, spewed toxic smoke into the air and smoldered for several days. Firefighters let it burn, citing the dangers of dousing lithium-ion battery fires with water, which can cause dangerous chemical reactions. The risk of reignition has been so high that cleanup crews are just now beginning to remove the charred batteries.

Knowles said the Darden site will be safer because batteries will be in independent enclosures separated by open space outdoors, not stacked and placed in an enclosed building like they were in Moss Landing.

With proper engineering, lithium-ion battery storage sites pose little risk of catching fire, said Shirley Meng, a molecular engineering professor at the University of Chicago who is an expert on batteries and studies ethically sourced, recyclable materials for energy storage. Safety has improved dramatically in recent years, and the failure rate is about 1 in 10 million for all types of lithium-ion batteries, she said.

“Everybody has batteries in their hands,” Meng said, referencing smartphones. “Batteries are safe. The chemistry that’s in those [large-scale] facilities is even safer than the ones that you hold in your phone.”

In western Fresno County, residents have “been very vocal” about the Darden project being built in a place where emergency response times are already long, said Ryan Michaels, assistant chief of operations for the Fresno County Fire Protection District, which provides emergency services for the area.

There is no fire station in the nearest communities of Cantua Creek, Five Points and Three Rocks. Response time is typically more than 20 minutes, and “we want to make sure that as solar grows we don’t reduce our current level of services within those communities,” Michaels said.

Several large solar farms already have been built and are planned, and “it really hit us by surprise how many were coming to western Fresno County,” he added.

In recent months, Michaels said, firefighters have responded to numerous malfunctioning alarms and inverter fires at solar farms, he said. One recent blaze was sparked by vandals trying to steal wiring.

Intersect Power and the Fresno County Fire Protection District said they are still negotiating fire mitigation measures. A state-required emergency action plan has not yet been finalized.

Stacey Shepard, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, said Darden, like all such projects, must meet strict safety standards. When batteries are being shipped from the factory to the project site, they can only be charged up to 30%, and the developer has to provide at least two gates into the battery storage facility wide enough for emergency access. On site, she noted, the batteries will be surrounded by thermal detection cameras.

Even so, the fire protection district said it will need to build four new stations and hire additional staff as more large clean energy projects are built.

Michaels said Darden and other projects have to be planned for the long term. If it is going to be operating for up to 35 years, he said, “we need to be ready to fight fire there — and provide for their workers — for decades.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39dfddc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F59%2Ff4c60ebb42eab5aef8d2ae3f4b89%2F1516848-me-proposed-battery-solar-storage-15.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:01:42.323414

Nishtar said that the launch of Zambia’s solar electrification project, “bringing clean energy to 250 health facilities and reaching 1.3 million people, alongside the DRIVE initiative in 41 districts, is a turning point for health equity.”

“These efforts will light up maternity wards, keep vaccines safe, and deliver care to the hardest-to-reach communities. They will also create over 200 jobs, showing how smart health investments can uplift lives and livelihoods. Zambia is showing what leadership looks like.”

With a commitment of approximately $28 million in funding, the HFSE initiative is designed to deploy 5 to 8kWp solar PV systems and cold chain equipment (CCE) in 1,277 health facilities across four countries: Zambia, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Uganda.

Solar-powered cold chain equipment rollout

UNICEF said Gavi has contributed significantly to the rollout of solar-powered cold chain equipment through the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP).

“However, fridges alone aren’t enough. This pilot tests whether that model can be scaled to fully solarise health facilities by powering lights, equipment and digital tools. If successful, it could unlock co-investment and long-term government support for maintenance, ensuring sustainability,” said UNICEF.

In Zambia, 250 healthcare facilities in 95 districts will be electrified under the HFSE project, prioritising off-grid facilities that provide maternity services and serve remote communities.

“This will ensure safe storage of vaccines and medicines, enable critical diagnostic and medical equipment, improve working conditions for health professionals and strengthen resilience and equity in primary health care services,” said UNICEF.

UNICEF said the GAVI project covering the four countries is slated to be completed by June 2026.

“Once the project is complete, an estimated 25 million people living in the catchment areas of the newly solarised health facilities will benefit from an increased range of services such as expanded access to immunisation services and availability of clean water. This includes 1.3 million people in Zambia.”

Zambia’s immunisation drive

“Today, more than 90% of children receive the full set of DTP 3 vaccines. But challenges remain. Some districts still lag behind, and the way vaccines and supplies are distributed within the country is one of the weakest parts of the system. This often leads to shortages or near shortages in many health facilities,” said UNICEF.

The Direct Delivery of Routine Immunisation Vaccines and other Essential health commodities for Equity (DRIVE) Initiative is a new and innovative approach to improving vaccine delivery in Zambia.

It works like a social enterprise, involving community volunteers, young people and others at the local level to help deliver vaccines and health supplies directly to clinics and outreach sites.

UNICEF said these delivery partners will work up to 10 days a month transporting vaccines.

And for the rest of the month they can use the same transport to earn income through other activities, helping them support themselves and maintain the vehicles.

Securing the cold chain supply

DRIVE is starting in 41 districts, creating 200 jobs. This will ensure vaccines and essential health supplies reach every clinic reliably and on time and also help health worker get to outreach sites without delays.

“The two initiatives we are launching today work hand in hand to strengthen our health system. By bringing vaccines and supplies directly to health centres and providing clean, reliable energy, we are making healthcare more accessible and consistent.

“These efforts support health workers, create jobs, build community ownership, and help us adapt to climate challenges,” said Bilal.

Both HFSE and DRIVE directly support Zambia’s progress towards the Immunisation Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring no child or community is left behind in the journey towards universal health coverage, said UNICEF.",https://www.esi-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AAA-zambia-solar-healthcare.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:01:45.783908

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy.
Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption.
Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse.
This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.","A Tennessee department head is hopeful that new guidance for a federal program supporting the growth of electric vehicle charging networks may ultimately allow the state to proceed with $21 million in contracts that have been frozen since February.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy. 64, which runs from Memphis to Pelham roughly along Tennessee’s southern border. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) awarded $21 million of the funding to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, each with ports to charge several vehicles, but the contracts were not executed before the federal program’s pause.

Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption. Tennessee’s EV manufacturing industry has grown over the last several years – often supported by state incentives to bring hundreds of jobs to rural communities – giving the state an economic interest in the vehicles’ success. Ford’s new BlueOval City facility in rural West Tennessee recently delayed mass production of its full-size electric truck until 2028 as the company refocuses on the production of cheaper, smaller models in Kentucky.

The $5 billion NEVI program has officially been on ice since February 2025, when the U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended funding to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to pause federal grants supporting electric vehicles and clean energy.

Multiple states have challenged the Trump administration’s ability to freeze the funds in federal court. Tennessee is not among them.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy recently released interim guidance for the program intending to “streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape,” according to the federal transportation department.

States can reapply for funding under the new requirements over the next 30 days.

Tennessee program makes progress on EV chargers while frozen federal projects languish

Tennessee Department of Transportation Director Beth Emmons said the department is reviewing the new guidance and updated requirements and “hopes to have a path forward with this program by the time the guidelines become official.”

The program’s deployment has been slow. Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse. The federal government allocated $3.3 billion to states for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Of the 38 states that have issued awards under previously approved plans (which must now be resubmitted), 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded a total $544 million.

The revised guidance went into effect on Aug. 13, and the Federal Highway Administration is accepting comments on the rule changes through Aug. 27.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement released Aug. 11. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises … While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Changes include scrapping language regarding serving “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities,” “equitable distribution,” and opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses. The guidance also removes requirements for states to “address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.”

Charging industry coalition welcomes changes, nonprofit says new requirements are another stall tactic

Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition supporting a nationwide EV charging network, welcomed the new guidance.

Slow uptake by states in NEVI’s first three years was due to “requirements within the original guidance that slowed down deployment,” according to a coalition statement released Aug. 13.

“The ultimate goal of the NEVI program is to expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure, and these updated guidelines will make that outcome more likely,” Charge Ahead Partnership Executive Director Jay Smith said. “A streamlined NEVI program will make it easier for the mom-and-pop gas station on the corner, along with national retail chains, to offer EV charging.”

The coalition is particularly optimistic about guidance encouraging states to prioritize applicants who will serve as the site host and charging provider, a move they say will cut down on time that would otherwise be spent searching for a site, and allow for simpler accountability.

The Sierra Club, one of several nonprofit groups that have joined legal challenges against the funding freeze, contends that the new guidance is “unnecessary” and serves only to further delay EV charging buildout as states reapply for funds.

“It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine Garcia stated in a news release.

“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging.”

Separate state program continues charger rollout

In the meantime, Tennessee’s separately funded Fast Charge TN program has supported EV charger installation in a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga.

The state program is powered by money from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. It aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways.

Under Fast Charge TN’s first round, 35 charging sites are operational and 18 more are under development.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which oversees the Fast Charge TN program, announced on Friday that it will extend its application period for the second round of funding through Sept. 19 at 4 p.m.

This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Charging-Station001-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:02:01.950674

Under the terms of the agreement, the partners will complete the COLA documentation that was submitted by Fermi America to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on June 17, 2025. In addition, they will support the review process for approval and work together to develop a long-term strategy for the site.

""We look forward to a productive partnership with Fermi America to bring these AP1000 units online at the pace needed to solidify America's energy dominance.""

The AP1000 is an advanced Generation III+ Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Each reactor has a net electrical output of approximately 1,100MWe to 1,117MWe. According to Westinghouse, it uses a simplified, two-loop PWR design with passive safety systems to enhance safety and efficiency. At present, there are six AP1000s in operation, with a further 14 under construction, and five more under contract.

The last set of AP1000 units installed in the US was at the Vogtle nuclear plant in 2023, coming in $17 billion over budget and more than seven years behind schedule.

The HyperGrid AI campus was announced back in June and will reportedly include “18 million sq ft (1.67 million sqm) of data centers and generate up to 11GW of IT capacity from natural gas, solar, wind, and clean nuclear energy.”

In July, the company acquired more than 600MW of natural gas generation across two deals. Following this, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Hyundai to deliver nuclear power to the project.

Fermi was co-founded by former US Energy Secretary and Texas governor Rick Perry. The company said geotechnical work has already begun on the campus and is expected to deliver 1GW of power by the end of 2026.

With rapid advances in technology and our understanding of Colorado’s renewable energy capacity, achieving a 100% renewable energy grid for Colorado is not a far-fetched goal.
Studies have shown the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy grid for Los Angeles, the U.S. and many other cities and countries around the world.
Finally, a timely transition to 100% renewable energy will help us avoid the worst climate-influenced disasters and their ever-mounting costs, such as the devastating Marshall Fire several years ago.
We know that a transition to 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is possible, so let’s advocate for it.","Xcel Energy’s recent decision to close its coal power plants across the state by 2030 puts Colorado at an important crossroads. The closing of these power plants, most notably Comanche 3 in Pueblo, presents an opportunity to transition our state to cleaner energy.

However, Xcel is proposing to replace the electric power from their coal plants in part with new gas-fired plants and are contemplating nuclear energy, all detailed in Xcel’s Just Transition Plan. But, the plan needs approval from the Public Utilities Commission to move forward. This is the perfect moment to tell the PUC we need a clean-energy future instead of one stuck with expensive, dysfunctional and polluting power plants for decades to come.

Doing so will ensure our state’s long-term health and financial well-being, and it will prevent the worst effects of climate change.

Under Colorado law, Xcel’s plan must result in an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, and nuclear energy may be used on the way to achieving Colorado’s commitment to 100% clean energy by 2050. However, nuclear energy carries great administrative and environmental risk, and Xcel already operates over 20 natural gas plants in the state. Xcel deserves credit for expanding the use of renewable energy in their plan, but the best time to plan for 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is now.

With rapid advances in technology and our understanding of Colorado’s renewable energy capacity, achieving a 100% renewable energy grid for Colorado is not a far-fetched goal. Modeling by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that Colorado has the wind and solar potential to meet our current demand many times over. And wind and solar technology continues to improve, increasing in efficiency by 30% to 40% in the last 15 years alone. Geothermal energy is also on the horizon for Colorado. The Western Governors’ Geothermal Task Force estimates Colorado can produce significant geothermal power within a decade, and Geothermal Technologies Inc. estimates it could produce 400 megawatts of power from several known sites.

A common concern with a 100% renewable grid is the daily and seasonal variability of wind and solar generation. However, renewables can meet demand 24/7, every day of the year by ramping up storage capacity combined with more constant sources like geothermal. The storage capacity of batteries continues to dramatically improve, enabling renewable energy grids to smooth out variability and release surplus power when it’s needed most. Studies have shown the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy grid for Los Angeles, the U.S. and many other cities and countries around the world. In fact, seven countries have nearly reached 100% renewable grids already.

Moving to 100% renewable energy is not only possible for Colorado, but is the best path for our health and environment. Pollution from gas-fired power plants poses serious risks to the health of those living nearby, including from nitrogen oxides and other airborne toxins that can cause cancer and cardiovascular disease. Colorado, and the Front Range in particular, also suffers from poor air quality due to high levels of ozone. Unfortunately, a warming climate is only making our ozone problems more severe and frequent.

Renewable energy is also the smart choice for Colorado’s economy. Numerous studies have shown that the development of wind and solar brings new jobs, especially if Colorado encourages more rooftop solar. The financial value of the public health benefits of using clean, renewable energy sources would also be sizable. Estimates for public health savings in Los Angeles, assuming a move toward 100% renewables, come in at $1.5 billion for a single year. Applied to Colorado’s population, that would be over $2 billion in savings per year. Finally, a timely transition to 100% renewable energy will help us avoid the worst climate-influenced disasters and their ever-mounting costs, such as the devastating Marshall Fire several years ago.

If we want to achieve this future of economic, health, and environmental benefits, there is no place for Xcel to build additional gas-fired plants or chase risky solutions like nuclear energy. We know that a transition to 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is possible, so let’s advocate for it. We owe it to ourselves and the next generation of Coloradans to do so.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Support 50% renewable energy generation targets by 2030.

Establish bankable projects financed under EXIM Bank programs, reducing reliance on non-compliant imports.

Create local employment opportunities in engineering, manufacturing, and project execution.

Deliver secure, future-proof energy systems that align with U.S. and Saudi regulatory frameworks.

The second half of the book traces the emergence and rise to intellectual dominance of the concept of “energy transition” itself.
When and where did the idea of an energy transition emerge?
The term “energy transition” itself was coined by the former Manhattan Project nuclear chemist Harrison Brown in 1967, at a conference of neo-Malthusians discussing food and family planning.
Thus the idea of an “energy transition” as a solution to the “energy crisis” entered the realm of public discussion, all oriented around the need to find a more reliable and abundant source of energy that couldn’t be choked off by OPEC.","In universities, labs, corporate research departments, think tanks, and intergovernmental organizations, thousands of smart, qualified experts are working away (or at least those who still have funding are working away), devoting billions of dollars and millions of hours to a problem they collectively refer to as “the energy transition.” The idea is simple: Human society once ran exclusively on photosynthetic sources of energy such as wood and animal power; then the Industrial Revolution brought about a transition to fossil fuel energy in the form of coal, which was later replaced by oil. The fossil fuel economy has become untenable on a planetary scale, so we must now bring about another transition, to renewable energy, through a huge project of innovation (facilitated by a heretofore unseen level of collaboration between the public and private sectors). The transitions of the past, the experts say, should provide helpful examples for how we can pull off such a feat. This monumental effort, we are told, is our best hope for surviving climate change. But according to the French historian of science Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, the battle is already lost. We are in a lot of trouble.

In More and More and More: An All-Consuming History of Energy, Fressoz sets out to show that there is no such thing as an “energy transition,” and there never has been. To put it bluntly: “After two centuries of ‘energy transitions,’ humanity has never burned so much oil and gas, so much coal and so much wood. Today around 2 billion cubic metres of wood are felled each year to be burned, three times more than a century ago.” Instead, Fressoz’s coruscating history looks to explain “why all primary energies have grown together and why they have accumulated without replacing each other.” Far from being an established empirical fact about the past, the “energy transition” began as “a heterodox and mercantile futurology—a mere industrial slogan—which, from the 1970s onwards, became the future of experts, governments and companies, including those that had no interest whatsoever in seeing it happen.”

The book splits cleanly into two halves. The first relentlessly piles up factual evidence to show that coal did not replace wood and oil did not replace coal. Rather, the production of each has entailed an intensification in the use of the others, such that the global history of energy can be seen as one of constant accumulation and the continued persistence of older techniques, not one of epochal technological transitions. The second half of the book traces the emergence and rise to intellectual dominance of the concept of “energy transition” itself. In this way, More and More and More is both a material history and an intellectual one, or as Fressoz puts it, “the politics of history in the face of climate change.”

Fressoz is a widely published historian of science who, along with Christophe Bonneuil, wrote The Shock of the Anthropocene (2015), a field-defining book that both dissects the concept of the “Anthropocene” and provides the most concise and terrifying digest of the postwar “Great Acceleration” in climatic destruction yet written. If one person is going to shout in public that the emperor is naked, Fressoz is among the most persuasive candidates.

Much of More and More and More makes for devastating reading. By considering the entirety of a production chain instead of just its output or its main source of power, Fressoz reveals that all of our economic systems are mutually dependent, and have been for centuries. The growth of the coal industry in the 19th century, for instance, depended on an immense amount of timber to prop up the mines and to transport the coal in ships and carts. With the introduction of chain saws in the 20th century, wood production became oil-intensive, such that “2 to 3 litres of diesel are consumed per cubic metre of wood extracted, meaning that wood has become, in part, a fossil fuel.” Forestry productivity has increased to keep up with demand, but it has done so through the use of chemical fertilizers that are oil-intensive to produce. And oil never really replaced coal: Cars drive on roads made of concrete, which is produced with coal, to the degree that about half a ton of coal is burned for every meter of concrete road. The first oil rigs were made of wood, as were the barrels that oil was transported in. Strip-mining for coal runs on oil-intensive machines, so even in surface mines it takes “between 1 and 2.5 litres of diesel to extract one tonne of coal.” And so on.

Even if it were possible to decarbonize electricity production (and recent work by Brett Christophers persuasively argues that it is not, at least not within market institutions), that still would not decarbonize the production of cement, steel, plastic, and fertilizers, which together account for a quarter of global emissions, and much of which would be used intensively in the production of whatever systems of solar and wind power would be needed for shifting the global electricity grid from fossil fuels to renewables.

If Fressoz is right—and he certainly is very convincing—how is it possible that so many intelligent people are spending so much money working on so many projects around the world to chase an impossible illusion?

When and where did the idea of an energy transition emerge? Fressoz argues that it originated in the Great Depression. Many scientists and engineers, inspired by the late work of Thorstein Veblen and a belief in the rational management of society, feared that the global economic downturn was the outcome of an energy transition gone wrong: The previous decades of industrial growth (in America especially) had generated a huge amount of output by marshaling an even larger amount of energy. That replacement of human power by electrical power was thought to be the cause of mass unemployment, even in the face of overproduction and overcapacity. Electricity had been the source of rapid growth, but it suddenly seemed to be the source of a structural crisis as well. This was understood to be a new puzzle requiring scientific management to solve. The members of this “technocracy movement” of the 1930s produced new kinds of statistical tools, especially the S-curve, which shows first exponential growth and then diminishing returns, thereby illustrating how apparently rapid growth is unsustainable. A group of scientists and engineers called the Technical Alliance used these curves in an unfinished report on energy usage in the United States, aiming to show that the unregulated capitalist system was wasteful.

The technocracy movement did not survive the interwar period: Some of its members embraced Herbert Hoover, who called himself America’s “chief engineer,” while others enthusiastically supported the New Deal’s expansion of technical management and regulation. The movement’s eccentric leader, Howard Scott, liked isolationism and quasi-military parades, which grew unattractive in the early 1940s. Yet, while the movement’s interpretation of the Depression did not last, its statistical tools did. In the postwar era, boosters of atomic energy used S-curves to show the inevitable decline of oil production, thereby creating the idea of “peak oil.” The same curves were used to illustrate future predictions for all sorts of things, from economic and population growth to person-hours per unit of production and industrial employment. These predictions were then marshaled for political advocacy. Across an increasing range of social and economic indicators, the “atomic Malthusians” (to use Fressoz’s delightful phrase) envisioned a future of finitude, one rife with population catastrophes, food and energy shortages, and economic decline that could only be prevented by a transition to nuclear energy. The term “energy transition” itself was coined by the former Manhattan Project nuclear chemist Harrison Brown in 1967, at a conference of neo-Malthusians discussing food and family planning.

The transition concept was embraced in nuclear policy advocacy, but it remained limited in its application until it intersected with another newly transformed idea. In the 1970s, the concept of an “energy crisis” (a sharper version of “energy transition”) was transformed from an ecological critique of too much energy to a policy critique of too little energy in the moment of oil price shocks, gasoline rationing, and the image of Jimmy Carter’s solar panels on the White House. Thus the idea of an “energy transition” as a solution to the “energy crisis” entered the realm of public discussion, all oriented around the need to find a more reliable and abundant source of energy that couldn’t be choked off by OPEC. And finally, after the 1970s, a number of free-market economists (among them Nobel laureate William Nordhaus) and fossil fuel companies like Exxon began using statistical projections of the future to argue that innovation and technology would inevitably find solutions to the possibility of climate disaster, thus obviating the need for any urgent action, let alone regulation. Emissions and fossil fuel use, they claimed, would also follow a reassuring S-curve pattern, and new technologies would benefit from the rapid upward slope of the first part of the curve while old ones tapered off. “The alignment of these inherently polluting industries under the banner of energy transition has at least one merit,” Fressoz writes: “It clarifies the ideological function of this notion. Energy transition has become the politically correct future for the industrial world.”

In this way, Fressoz means to show two things: first, that the idea of “energy transition” was long a fringe belief associated with Depression-era industrial theorists, radical environmentalists, and atomic Malthusians, all people whom respectable mainstream scientific opinion would probably disavow today. And second, that the conceptual and empirical toolbox of S-curves, future discounting, and transition dynamics invented in one time and place has gone on to serve different purposes in others, especially regarding our ability to imagine the future. “Transition,” Fressoz writes, “projects a past that does not exist onto an elusive future.”

Ad Policy

Any discussion of capitalism, climate change, and the future must eventually invoke Fredric Jameson’s observation that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. Fressoz does so here, to chilling effect, in his discussion of Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is the working group on mitigation. They have adopted wholesale the innovation paradigm from the fossil fuel industry to imagine a preposterous future—of infinite growth made possible by marine cloud seeding and space mirrors, all purely hypothetical—thereby foreclosing the possibility of changes to the institutions of capitalism. Fressoz heaps scorn on their hectic ideas, such as burning fast-growing trees in an amount greater than the world’s total wood production, then burying the carbon in the ground indefinitely. “Some experts within Group III of the IPCC,” he writes, “will have entertained visions of liquefied CO2 lakes resting on the ocean floor before considering the reduction of the size of any national economy.”

From this, Fressoz reaches a damning conclusion: “Transition is the ideology of capital in the twenty-first century,” and our faith in innovation and technology as a solution “is preventing us from having an adult conversation about climate change.”

This is strong stuff, and the stakes are perilously high. Some readers are likely to object to the way that Fressoz counts inputs and intermediary goods in production—but that is exactly his point. We have created conceptual tools—including measuring economies within national borders, not production chains—that do not allow us to see the actual materiality of any economic process from beginning to end. Others will object that Fressoz does not clearly set out what he thinks the missing “adult conversation” should look like, aside from several references to degrowth. At 320 pages, the book is brief enough that I do wish he had taken that point on explicitly, because his commitment to unsparing realism might have provided new insights into the common critique of degrowth: namely, that the world is profoundly unequal, so an end to growth will either create permanent inequality or depend on a politically implausible program of global redistribution. If that is the adult conversation, it needs to start.

It must also be said that this is a profoundly bleak book. The central hope for human survival held by most experts, technocrats, politicians, and the alarmed general public is not only a fiction, Fressoz insists, but an active impediment that has set back action by decades, to such a degree that it is now probably too late. All that work on mitigation has been dithering around the margins, mainly acting as cover and public relations for egregious polluters and emitters, at best producing some moderate process improvements that have immediately been offset by increases in total production or the geographical redistribution of the most obviously harmful activity to poorer countries.

Fressoz is adamant that there is no realistic possibility of carbon-free material abundance, and that the world is not thinkable without plastic, fertilizer, and cement, the building blocks of modern life, which cannot be decarbonized even under a transition to electricity from solar and wind. Perhaps, then, the adult conversation is about what a world of permanently declining material standards will look like. If so, it is difficult to feel confident that all those mitigating and innovating scientists, lawyers, policy wonks, and academics will pivot to working collectively on a program of global redistribution rather than continuing to do what they have done for decades, which is serve the interests of capital. Meanwhile, those opportunistic enough can make a quick buck on fantasies of energy transition, while any project of redistribution faces bigger and bigger obstacles, with less and less time and resources available.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1355969231.jpeg,N,,2025-08-25 05:59:18.975040

Each article highlights the repercussions of specific policies and budget reallocations.

Trump's recent bill opposes clean energy initiatives, affecting long-term prospects for Kansas City. The bill rescinds tax credits for solar panels and electric vehicles, potentially slowing down adoption and increasing energy costs for residents. The termination of credits impacts local manufacturing, as seen with Panasonic's battery plant, which delays its full production and employment targets. A study reveals Missouri utility bills will rise notably due to increased oil and gas leasing. This amplifies financial strain on households already struggling with utility payments.

The local radio station, KKFI, confronts a budget cut due to federal funding reduction for public broadcasting. This could limit programming and reduce community outreach, as it heavily relies on federal support for music licensing and emergency broadcasts. KKFI's potential limitations could mean fewer opportunities for emerging local artists and vital community information-sharing.

Eager to hear more about Sun Day and the meteoric rise of clean energy?","Canary Media’s ​“Electrified Life” column shares real-world tales, tips, and insights to demystify what individuals can do to shift their homes and lives to clean electric power.

Heard of Earth Day? Get ready for Sun Day.

On Sept. 21, a Sunday of course, thousands of people will gather across the U.S. to spread the message that the clean energy revolution is here. By harnessing the sun — whose thermal energy also gives rise to wind — instead of burning fossil fuels, we can all enjoy cleaner air, lower utility bills, and a host of other benefits.

The day of action is the brainchild of climate journalist and activist Bill McKibben and is being spearheaded by nonprofit communications lab Fossil Free Media. They and a coalition of dozens of advocacy groups are bringing people together on Sun Day to celebrate the progress humanity has made in advancing and adopting renewable energy — and to push for a faster transition away from fossil fuels.

Helping Americans understand all that clean energy has to offer is more urgent than ever, as the Trump administration continues to target renewables, rapidly phasing out tax credits for solar and wind, halting offshore wind development, and maligning battery projects.

Meanwhile solar and wind power are booming globally. And even in the U.S., more than 90% of new power capacity installed last year came from solar, wind, and batteries. Everywhere, the cost of building renewable power is plummeting, making solar and wind the cheapest sources of new electricity.

“We still think of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines as ​‘alternative energy,’ as if they were the Whole Foods of power, nice but pricey. In fact — ­and more so with each passing month —­ they are the Costco of energy, inexpensive and available in bulk,” writes McKibben in his new book ​“Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization,” which shines a light on the growth of renewables.

“The general public just isn’t aware of how far clean energy has come,” said Jamie Henn, a longtime climate activist and now head of Fossil Free Media.

Individuals and groups have planned more than 150 community events around the country for Sun Day so far. In New York City, organizers are hosting a festival with informational booths, performances, and face-painting. Around Clemson, South Carolina, residents with homes powered by rooftop solar are throwing open their doors to public tours. In Moscow, Idaho, people will be able to test-drive their neighbors’ zero-emissions cars at an electric-vehicle fair.

​“It’s going to be a beautiful day,” said Antonique Smith, a Grammy-nominated singer and actress who cofounded the nonprofit Climate Revival and has assumed the role of Sun Day ambassador.

Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.’s organizing in churches for the Civil Rights Movement, Smith visits houses of worship to explain that there’s an alternative to the fossil fuel plants that spew cancer-causing pollution disproportionately in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

“Clean energy and solar are so important, especially to communities of color and poor communities,” Smith told Canary Media. ​“How wonderful is it that we have this solution? … It’s not a luxury anymore.”

At climate events, Smith often sings a slowed-down version of The Beatles’ ​“Here Comes the Sun” to honor the power of activism and clean energy. Her rendition is also the anthem for the upcoming day of action, and she’ll be performing the song at Sun Day extravaganzas in Brooklyn and Times Square, she said.

Sun Day will also give people a chance to reflect on the risks of a rapidly warming world, according to the Rev. Fletcher Harper, executive director of GreenFaith, a global interfaith environmental coalition. GreenFaith is working with more than 30 partner groups, representing a couple hundred congregations, that are hosting Sun Day gatherings, including a climate-justice pilgrimage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

“When you look at the impacts of climate change — dangerous levels of heat, drought that forces small farmers around the world off of land that sustained their families for generations, fires that destroy people’s homes, and floods from severe storms — it’s the destruction of the environment that creates enormous human suffering,” Harper said. ​“It’s just wrong. … And the crime is that it’s preventable.”

The fossil fuel industry, having peddled its products while knowing the existential threat they pose, is a candidate for ​“one of Dante’s inner circles,” he noted wryly.

The moment for a clean energy movement

Sun Day’s organizers aim to spark a widespread popular movement whose influence is felt long after the day of action.

“People power is just this incredible way to unlock progress more quickly,” Henn said. ​“And that’s what we need to meet the kind of climate targets that we have in place.”

With all of its economic and societal advantages, clean energy might be inevitable, but ​“we can’t let this take 40 years,” he noted. ​“We need it to happen over the next five to 10 years, [which] will require a real mobilization.”

Solar and wind projects are increasingly hitting resistance at the local level.

“We’re just getting completely outplayed,” Henn said. The fossil fuel industry has ​“invested in front groups [and] field campaigns” to spread misinformation through Facebook and organize people against clean energy, he noted.

Sun Day will bring together people who can call on local leaders, regulators, and representatives to deliver clean energy now. Indeed, Fossil Free Media is already helping build those local grassroots networks, said Deirdre Shelly, who’s leading organizing efforts for the big day.

While the broader Energy sector has stumbled in Q2 2025 amid collapsing oil prices and regulatory headwinds, energy infrastructure—encompassing grid modernization, renewable energy, and storage—has emerged as a resilient outperformer. This divergence is not accidental. It reflects a profound shift in the U.S. economy, driven by surging electricity demand, policy tailwinds, and the urgent need to modernize aging systems. For investors, the case for energy infrastructure is no longer speculative—it is a calculated bet on the future of energy.

Structural Shifts: From Fossil Fuels to Electrification

The U.S. energy landscape is undergoing a tectonic transformation. By 2025, the electric power sector's capital investment has hit a record $179 billion, with projections of $1.4 trillion in cumulative spending from 2025 to 2030. This surge is driven by three forces:

1. Electrification of the economy: Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, and industrial processes are accelerating demand. Data centers alone are expected to require 35 GW of electricity by 2030, up from 17 GW in 2022.

2. Renewable energy expansion: Solar and wind capacity additions are outpacing fossil fuels. Solar is projected to account for 58% of new energy capacity in 2024, while battery storage capacity has grown from 6% of total storage in 2018 to 48% today.

3. Grid modernization: Aging infrastructure, climate risks, and the need for distributed energy resources (DERs) are pushing utilities to invest in smart grids, cybersecurity, and non-wire alternatives.

Policy Tailwinds: The Inflation Reduction Act and Beyond

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) have created a policy superhighway for energy infrastructure. The IIJA allocated $73 billion for grid modernization, while the IRA's tax credits for renewables and storage have unlocked $450 billion in private investment in semiconductors and EV manufacturing. These policies are not just theoretical—they are reshaping the sector's economics.

For example, the IRA's 30% tax credit for pumped storage hydropower (PSH) has reignited interest in this long-neglected technology. Similarly, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's shortened deadlines for clean energy tax credits (projects must come online by 2027) has created a “race to build,” accelerating project timelines and boosting near-term earnings for infrastructure developers.

The Trump administration's deregulatory agenda has further amplified these tailwinds. Streamlined permitting and tax cuts have enabled small-cap energy and industrial firms to expand margins, while the focus on energy independence has spurred domestic production of critical minerals and components.

Earnings Resilience: A Sector in Transition

While the S&P 500 Energy sector has posted a -24% year-over-year earnings drop in Q2 2025, energy infrastructure has bucked the trend. The Oil & Gas Storage & Transportation sub-industry, for instance, saw a 14% earnings increase, driven by LNG exports and pipeline maintenance. Meanwhile, utilities and renewable energy firms have delivered consistent returns, with the U.S. utilities sector up 34.6% since January 2024.

Looking ahead, the sector's earnings trajectory is poised to outperform. Analysts project 10.2% earnings growth in Q1 2026 and 29.8% in Q2 2026, as OPEC's potential return to the market stabilizes oil prices and LNG demand surges. For infrastructure, the numbers are even more compelling: energy infrastructure ETFs trade at a 15% discount to global equities on a forward P/E basis, suggesting significant upside as demand for electricity continues to rise.

Investment Implications: Balancing Growth and Stability

For investors, the key is to pair high-growth energy infrastructure plays with defensive assets. Jefferies recommends overweighting energy infrastructure ETFs and pairing them with high-margin tech firms to balance the risks of AI-driven electricity demand surges. Specific opportunities include:

- Grid modernization firms: Companies like Brookfield Renewable Partners and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners are leading joint ventures in offshore wind and solar.

- Battery storage developers: Firms with utility-scale projects, such as Intersect Power (partnering with Google and TPG), are positioned to capitalize on the IRA's incentives.

- Private capital partnerships: Utilities like Duke Energy and Dominion Energy are leveraging private equity to fund renewable projects, reducing debt burdens and accelerating ROI.

However, risks remain. Rising interest rates have increased utility debt costs, with 14% of 2025 capital investment now sourced from equity. Regulatory lag in authorizing returns on equity also poses a challenge. Investors must monitor interconnection delays and credit ratings for utilities, as some face downgrades due to strained balance sheets.

Conclusion: A Resilient Cornerstone of the S&P 500

The S&P 500's rally is not just a tech-driven story. Energy infrastructure is emerging as a critical pillar of this bull market, driven by structural demand, policy tailwinds, and earnings resilience. While the broader Energy sector faces headwinds, infrastructure-focused plays are well-positioned to outperform. For investors seeking long-term growth in a volatile market, energy infrastructure offers a compelling case: it is both a beneficiary of the AI and electrification megatrends and a hedge against the sector's cyclical downturns.

Google and Kairos Power to deploy first advanced nuclear plant in Tennessee Valley under order book agreement

Google, Kairos Power, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced on 08/18/25 a new power purchase agreement (PPA) between Kairos Power and TVA, Kairos Power’s Hermes 2 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., will deliver up to 50 MWe (MW) of reliable, 24/7 energy to the TVA grid that powers Google data centers in TVA’s service area.

TVA is the first U.S. utility to sign a PPA to buy electricity from an advanced, GEN IV reactor. Hermes 2 is the first deployment under Kairos Power’s landmark deal with Google to enable 500 MWe of new, advanced nuclear capacity to come online by 2035 in support of Google’s load growth.

To accelerate the delivery of clean energy to Google, Kairos Power will increase Hermes 2’s output from 28 MW to 50 MW generated by a single reactor, which is scheduled to begin revenue operations in 2030.

Kairos said initially the units for Google will include a single 50-MW reactor, with three subsequent power plants that would each have two 75-MW reactors.

Through this agreement, Google will receive the clean energy attributes from the Kairos plant through the TVA system to further decarbonize its data center operations in Montgomery County, TN, and Jackson County, AL.

Google / Kairos Master Agreement

TVA will purchase electricity from Kairos Power’s Hermes 2 plant starting operations in 2030. In this initial phase of the collaboration, Kairos and Google will procure clean energy attributes from the plant through TVA to help power Google data centers in the region with locally sourced clean energy 24/7 365.

Under the agreement, Kairos Power will develop, construct, and operate a series of advanced reactor plants and sell energy, ancillary services, and environmental attributes to Google under Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

Google said by committing to a so-called order book framework with Kairos, instead of buying one reactor at a time, it is sending a demand signal to the market and making a long-term investment to speed development of SMRs. Milestone-based accountability is baked into the agreement will establish confidence in Kairos Power’s ability to deliver throughout the long-term partnership.

“Our partnership with Google will enable Kairos Power to quickly advance down the learning curve as we drive toward cost and schedule certainty for our commercial product,” said Mike Laufer, Kairos Power CEO and co-founder.

Kairos will have to navigate complex approvals through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but already has clearance to build a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, which could start operating in 2027.

The Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor is the first and only Generation IV reactor to be approved for construction by the NRC and the first non-light-water reactor to be permitted in the US in over 50 years. Hermes is a non-power version of Kairos Power’s fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR.

Kairos has also begun construction on a new reactor-grade salt production facility at its manufacturing development campus in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Kairos Power: The Reactor Technology

Kairos Power’s technology uses a molten-salt cooling system, combined with a ceramic, pebble-type fuel, to efficiently transport heat to a steam turbine to generate power. This passively safe system allows the reactor to operate at low pressure, enabling a simpler more affordable nuclear reactor design.

Instead of water, which is used in traditional reactors, Kairos uses molten fluoride salt as a coolant. The molten salts transfer heat away from the reactor core. The heat can then be used either to produce electricity or for industrial processes such as oil refining, desalination, and steel production.

These reactors have several inherent safety advantages. The first, and possibly the most important, is that the reactor is operated at low pressure because the coolants never approach boiling point. Even in an accident, there would be no force expelling materials from the reactor, and no high-pressure containment system would be required to prevent such a release.

The plant will use TRISO coated particle fuel. TRISO – or “tristructural-isotropic” – fuel particles contain a spherical kernel of enriched uranium oxycarbide surrounded by layers of carbon and silicon carbide, which contains fission products.

Other major data center users, including Microsoft and Amazon, have recently turned to nuclear power to support the energy intensive needs of data centers supporting artificial intelligence.

Aalo Closes $100M Series B Funding

Aalo, an Austin, TX, developer of microreactors announced that Aalo has closed a $100M Series B financing led by Valor Equity Partners, with participation from new and existing investors including Fine Structure Ventures, Hitachi Ventures, Crosscut, NRG Energy, Vamos Ventures, Tishman Speyer, Kindred Ventures, 50Y, Harpoon Ventures, Crescent Enterprises, Alumni Ventures, MCJ, Gaingels, Perpetual VC, and Nucleation Capital, among others.

In a press statement the firm said, “We now have the capital to build our first nuclear power plant, the Aalo-X, which we’re aiming to bring to zero-power criticality next summer. This could be the first advanced nuclear power plant to turn on in the US in decades. This is not just a test reactor, but rather a full plant that will produce electricity.”

A unique aspect of the use of the funding is that Aalo is planning to put an experimental data center right next to it. This will be the first time a nuclear plant and data center are built together.

The firm also noted that in the past year, the firm finished the build-out of a 40,000 sqft pilot factory, and our full-scale non-nuclear prototype.

Aalo’s Master Plan

Serve the data center market.

Build Aalo-X to prove product-market fit: speed, reliability, and economics for data centers. Then build thousands of Aalo Pods (five Aalo-1 reactors and one turbine per Pod), to power data centers at scale.

Bring the cost down and expand.

Enter many more markets, e.g. municipal utilities (for whom GW-scale reactors are too big), desalination, industrial process heat, and more. Data centers are only 1% of the power market globally, so there are a lot of other markets to go after.

Make a more powerful reactor.

Our next reactor will be approximately 10x more powerful, in a similar physical form-factor to the Aalo-1 (still with a focus on mass manufacturability and road transportability). This will bring down the cost of electricity further, getting us closer to our mission of 3 c / kWh.

KHNP And Westinghouse Ink Nuclear Energy Agreement

(NucNet) According to multiple news media reports published in South Korea, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Westinghouse have set up a joint venture for US and European projects as they move on from a legal settlement that has been criticized by politicians in Seoul. Top level political leaders in South Korea immediately criticized the deal as being “unfair.”

The proposed joint venture paves the way for South Korean nuclear firms to expand in the US. The South Korean 1400 MW PWR completed the NRC’s safety design review n April 2019. The NRC approved a rule to certify the APR-1400 standard design. In September 2018, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the APR-1400 Standard Design Approval, and in September 2019 it received a design certificate valid for 15 years.

The agreement with Westinghouse comes after KHNP was awarded a 26 trillion won (€16 billion, $18 billion) contract in June to build two nuclear power plants at Dukovany in the Czech Republic,

According to the news media reports, KHNP ceded leadership of nuclear projects in Europe to Westinghouse when it settled the dispute in order to secure the Dukovany contract.

As a result, KHNP is said to be barred from entering the nuclear markets of European Union member states – except the Czech Republic – the US, the UK, Japan and Ukraine. This means it is restricted to pursuing projects in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, South America, and Turkey. In effect the two firms carved up the potential global market for PWR reactors.

According to press reports, KHNP and its parent company Korea Electric Power Corporation also agreed to pay Westinghouse $825 million in goods, services and royalties per exported reactor over the next 50 years.

Westinghouse had accused the South Korean company of infringing on its intellectual property, claiming KHNP’s APR1000 and APR1400 plant designs use its licensed technology.The January settlement removed a major hurdle for a KHNP-led consortium to sign the final Dukovany contract in June.

KHNP has withdrawn from bidding for nuclear deals in the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden in the past year. The company also said this week it had pulled out of a potential Polish project.

Oyster Creek NJ Site Tagged to Host Four 320 MW SMRs

The Asbury Press (NJ) and the Associated Press report that Holtec International proposes building four small modular reactors (SMRs), a solar field, and battery storage at the former Oyster Creek nuclear plant site in Lacey, NJ.

The firm, which has a Camden, NJ, SMR manufacturing plant, wants to build four 300 MWE SMRs, a solar energy field and utility-scale battery storage at the site of the former Oyster Creek Generating Station.

Holtec, one of the world’s largest nuclear energy component manufacturers, purchased the former nuclear plant and its property in 2019 and has been decommissioning the 1960s-era nuclear facility. Now Holtec sees the property as an excellent location for a new power project, because of the Lacey, NJK, existing transmission line connections to the larger electrical grid.

Holtec is currently deploying its small modular reactors, or SMR-300s, at the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Covert, MI. The company said Oyster Creek’s project, if permitted and approved, would follow the Michigan project.

Oyster Creek’s four modular reactors would each produce 320 MW of electricity, or 1,280 MW. By comparison, twice that of the old Oyster Creek plant generated 637 MW. Being four separate units, the design has an advantage compared to one large nuclear reactor: each unit can be powered down and refueled independently, without powering down the entire system.

General Fusion Gets $22M Bump from Investors

General Fusion, a Canadian nuclear fusion energy startup, announced that it had been thrown a lifeline in the form of $22 million in fresh funding. The firm’s burn rate caused it face cash crunch.

Last May the company laid off at least 25% of its employees in May in a bid to shore up its stretched finances. At the same time, CEO Greg Twinney wrote an open letter pleading for funding. The additional cash will give General Fusion some breathing room, though not much.

According to the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper, a subset of General Fusion’s existing investors ultimately was a “pay to play” round. This is a financing structure where existing investors must participate to maintain their ownership stakes — that included Chrysalix Venture Capital, Gaingels, Hatch, MILFAM, JIMCO, PenderFund, Presight Capital, Segra Capital Management, and Thistledown Capital. PenderFund and Segra gained board seats as part of the deal. General Fusion was founded in 2002 and before this round had raised $440 million, according to PitchBook.

Though the company described the round as “oversubscribed,” the $22 million falls far short of the $125 million that the company was reportedly seeking. Adam Rodman, chief investment officer at Segra Capital, told The Globe and Mail that the $22 million was “the least amount of capital possible” to help the company hit the next scientific milestone.

Just months before signaling a cash crunch, General Fusion activated its latest device, Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), a half-scale prototype of a commercial-scale reactor. The new funding will give the company more time to run LM26 as it attempts to hit key scientific milestones. The fact that the company met an important internal technical milestones helped boost investor confidence in the fusion project.

General Fusion is pursuing what’s known as “magnetized target fusion.” Inside its reactor, electricity flows through deuterium-tritium fuel — heavy hydrogen isotopes — generating a magnetic field to contain the plasma. That plasma is then compressed by a liquid lithium wall that is pressed inward by steam-driven pistons. The combination should drive the temperature and pressure inside the plasma high enough to trigger a fusion reaction.

General Fusion said it is still pursuing scientific breakeven, though it didn’t provide a timeline. The company also listed two intermediary goals: heating plasmas to 10 million degrees Celsius and 100 million degrees Celsius.

Investors told the news media that given the limited size of the fresh funding, it seems likely that General Fusion will shoot for the most achievable milestones to convince investors to cut a new round of checks. The company may have bought itself a few precious months, but unless it can deliver promising results, it may find itself back in the same tight spot it was in during May.

Meralco Partners with South Korean Firms to Advance Nuclear Energy in the Philippines

The Manila Times reports that MANILA Electric Co. (Meralco) said that it had signed agreements with several South Korean firms to advance its push for nuclear energy in the Philippines via the development and use of small modular reactors (SMRs). Meralco believes that SMRs are a future-ready energy solution, particularly for off-grid areas in the country.

South Korea has several SMR designs under development. In June 2024 the 100MWe SMART100 small modular reactor design has been granted standard design approval by South Korea’s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission.

According to a report by World Nuclear News, SMART is a 330 MWt pressurised water reactor with integral steam generators and advanced safety features. The unit is designed for electricity generation (up to 100 MWe) as well as thermal applications, such as seawater desalination, with a 60-year design life and three-year refuelling cycle.

While the basic design of the SMART is complete, development has been stalled by the absence of any orders for an initial reference unit. It was developed by KAERI, which had planned to build a demonstration plant to operate from 2017.

“The upgraded model is now ready for global export, particularly to Saudi Arabia, a key partner in the development of this technology,” KAERI said.

In September 2019, South Korea and Saudi Arabia agreed to collaborate on the commercialization of the SMART SMR. Under the memorandum of understanding, the two countries agreed to work together to refine the design of the SMART reactor.

Korea will also assist in gaining Saudi design approval of the reactor, as well as cooperating in the construction and operation of a SMART reactor in Saudi Arabia. The partners will also promote the SMART design to other Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries considering the use of small reactors.

Domestic Collaborations in South Korea

A key domestic partnership is with DL Engineering & Construction to explore the deployment of SMRs in the Philippines and conduct feasibility studies, site assessments, and long-term strategic planning. The distribution utility also conducted site visits and strategic dialogues in South Korea with its existing partners, Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power, Samsung C&T Corp., and LG Energy Solutions.

Through its energy education unit, Meralco Power Academy, Meralco also signed a memorandum of understanding with Kepco International Nuclear Graduate School, where Meralco will be sending scholars beginning March 2026.

This initiative is part of Meralco’s Filipino Scholars and Interns on Nuclear Engineering program through which the company aims to build a skilled workforce.

Meralco also discussed potential collaborations with Korea Electric Power Corp. on smart grid modernization, storm hardening, and energy transition strategies, particularly on advanced metering infrastructure rollout, grid automation, data analytics, and distributed energy resource integration.

“Our strategic engagements in South Korea underscore our commitment to the responsible development of nuclear energy,” Meralco Executive Vice President and COO Ronnie Aperocho said.

Nuclear Waste Could Provide Fuel For Fusion Energy

Expensive and rare tritium means ‘breeding’ techniques are needed

(American Chemical Society) Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have unveiled simulations showing how radioactive nuclear waste could be repurposed to generate tritium, the rare hydrogen isotope that fuels nuclear fusion.

Terence Tarnowsky, a physicist at Los Almos, will present his findings at the American Chemical Society’s autumn 2025 meeting. His research suggests that decades of stored waste might help unlock a cleaner, virtually limitless energy.

Nuclear fusion that uses the isotopes deuterium and tritium as fuel is seen as a promising pathway for generating energy, mainly because it requires lower energy input compared to other fusion reactions.

However, because tritium is rare and expensive, “breeding” techniques will be needed to provide enough of it for sustainable fusion power generation.

Current global supplies, largely sourced from Canadian CANDU heavy-water reactors, amount to around 25 kg, worth about $33 million (€28m) per kg.

Tritium is produced in CANDU reactors as a byproduct of neutron interactions with the heavy water that is used as both moderator and coolant. According to ScienceDirect.com, approximately 130 grams of tritium are generated annually in a typical CANDU reactor.

Globally, the size of installed CANDU reactors varies some as small as approximately 200 MW (India) to 800 MW in Canada. Romania is currently completing two 700 MW PHWR type reactors at its Cernavoda site.

Nuclear fusion does not always require tritium. While the most commonly discussed fusion reaction, deuterium-tritium fusion, does involve tritium, other fusion reactions are possible. Deuterium-deuterium fusion, for example, can occur without tritium, although it requires higher temperatures and is less efficient.

Without a reliable tritium pipeline, commercial fusion plants cannot scale up. A single 1,000 MW fusion reactor would require more than 55 kg of tritium per year, far beyond current supply.

Tarnowsky’s proposal centers on accelerator-driven systems that bombard spent nuclear fuel with particles. This process triggers reactions that generate neutrons, which can then be harvested to produce tritium through a series of nuclear transitions.

Computer simulations suggest that a 1,000 MW system could produce about 2 kg of tritium annually, rivalling the total yearly output of all Canadian reactors. A key advantage to Tarnowsky’s system would be the efficiency of tritium production. He projects that the design would produce more than 10 times as much tritium as a fusion reactor at the same thermal power.

Tarnowsky now plans to work out the cost for tritium production, and evaluate the efficiency and safety of the hypothetical reactor design.

In the past five years, South Korea has consistently ranked as Vietnam’s largest foreign direct investor and one of its leading trade partners.

According to data from the General Department of Customs, two-way trade between the two countries reached nearly USD 50 billion in the first seven months of this year. Vietnam’s exports to South Korea totaled USD 16.3 billion, while imports from South Korea amounted to USD 33.7 billion.

Vietnam’s exports to South Korea are dominated by high-tech and consumer goods. Computers, electronics, and components topped the list with USD 4.7 billion, followed by phones and accessories (USD 2.3 billion), machinery and spare parts (nearly USD 1.8 billion), and textiles (USD 1.5 billion).

In return, Vietnam imports mainly production-related goods and intermediate materials, including over USD 20 billion in electronics and components, more than USD 2.7 billion in machinery and tools, and over USD 1.2 billion each in raw plastic materials and petroleum products.

The economic ties between the two countries are not only strong in volume but also deeply complementary. Vietnam has become a manufacturing and export hub for many South Korean conglomerates. Conversely, South Korea provides Vietnam with essential machinery, technology, and raw materials for domestic production.

South Korea currently holds the top position in foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam, with a cumulative registered capital of around USD 87–92 billion across more than 10,100 projects. This accounts for approximately 24.1% of project numbers and 18.2% of total FDI in Vietnam.

Key sectors attracting investment include electronics manufacturing, supporting industries, textiles, infrastructure development, and industrial real estate. Samsung Electronics alone has invested over USD 22 billion, making Vietnam its largest global smartphone and component production base. LG Display recently committed an additional USD 1 billion to expand its OLED screen factory in Hai Phong, raising its total investment to USD 5.6 billion. Meanwhile, Hana Micron invested another USD 930 million in a semiconductor packaging project in Bac Giang.

In contrast, Vietnamese investment in South Korea remains modest, focusing mainly on restaurants, food services, and other service sectors. This presents a significant opportunity for Vietnamese firms to expand into the Korean market and gain expertise in management and technology.

Toward a USD 150 billion trade target

According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Vietnam-Korea Free Trade Agreement (VKFTA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) have made Vietnam increasingly strategic in South Korea’s supply chain diversification plans. Korean demand for Vietnamese agricultural products, seafood, and garments remains robust and steady.

Last year, Vietnam-South Korea bilateral trade reached USD 81.5 billion, up 7.3% year-over-year. Earlier this year, the two countries agreed on a target to grow their trade to USD 150 billion by 2030, with a focus on balance and sustainability.

To realize this goal, South Korea’s Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy, Ahn Duk-geun, proposed enhanced cooperation in industrial and energy sectors. He called for both countries to promote collaboration in the supply chain of critical minerals by jointly implementing the Essential Mineral Supply Chain Technology Cooperation Center project. The initiative aims to create favorable conditions for Korean enterprises to invest in LNG power, clean energy, and nuclear energy projects in Vietnam.

Speaking at the release of the AEO’s second-quarter 2025 monitoring report on renewable energy, energy transition, and climate change, Jamal Al-Loughani said the region must adopt multiple energy sources.

The AEO, formerly the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, was restructured and renamed following a Saudi proposal adopted during its 113th ministerial meeting in Kuwait in December 2024. The move reflects efforts to expand its mandate beyond petroleum to cover the full spectrum of energy developments.

The restructuring comes as rapid transformations reshape the global energy sector, compelling Arab states to adapt to broader trends in clean technology and sustainable investments.

“Diversification of the energy mix is essential, but no source should be excluded,” Al-Loughani said in a statement to Kuwait News Agency.

“Oil and gas will continue to dominate with a share of over 50 percent both now and in the future,” he added.

The secretary-general attributed oil and gas’s continued dominance primarily to growing demand across all economic sectors, including transportation and electricity, and their increasing necessity in various industries such as petrochemicals, fertilizers, and heavy manufacturing.

He said increased investment and innovation by the organization’s member states in clean technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage will make the petroleum industry more sustainable and reliable in meeting growing energy demand.

The report noted a “significant global expansion in the renewable energy sector during the second quarter 2025, driven by major investments and supportive policies.”

China maintained its global leadership, accounting for half of the world’s solar capacity, advancing the largest floating wind turbine, and beginning construction on the world’s biggest hydroelectric dam.

In the US, clean energy provided most of the electricity for three consecutive months for the first time. India also saw a sharp rise in added renewable capacity, supported by solar projects.

Al-Loughani said many Arab nations have adopted policies supporting renewables based on economic diversification. Despite this positive momentum, he also said the sector faces challenges, most notably political and regulatory instability in some markets.

“Enhancing the infrastructure for renewable energy projects is no longer an option but has become a necessity,” as climate risks increase significantly alongside growing global interest in renewable sources, he added.

The AEO secretary-general outlined the Arab world’s potential for competitively priced green hydrogen production, which can be used for decarbonization directly or through derivatives like ammonia. This could attract foreign investment, create quality jobs, improve trade balances, and add value through exporting low-carbon products.

“Achieving success in energy transitions requires aligning ambitions with executive capabilities through adopting realistic steps, pumping long-term investments, and establishing reliable regulatory frameworks,” he said, adding that effective energy transitions are no longer just an environmental issue but a foundation for economic stability.

A significant financing gap remains, with over 90 percent of global clean energy investments since 2021 going to advanced economies and China, despite 80 percent of future energy demand growth coming from developing nations, Al-Loughani said. This reflects a structural imbalance that must be addressed to ensure a just and effective global energy transition.

He also highlighted nuclear power as a pivotal strategic option for enhancing global energy security and reducing emissions, with small modular reactors opening new prospects. Furthermore, he identified critical metals markets as a strategic element for the clean energy transition, though geopolitical constraints could pose crucial tests for global supply chains.

Regarding the digital economy, Al-Loughani said that data centers are now a vital part of global infrastructure, and their role is expected to grow with the advancement of artificial intelligence. Sustaining this growth requires major coordination to ensure clean power and develop innovative solutions to reduce consumption.

He also said climate change is no longer a long-term challenge, but a reality that requires urgent global action for adaptation, mitigation, and protection.

Al-Loughani added that the UN’s COP30 conference must be a turning point that is not limited to achieving ambitions, but also includes justice, equity, and finance for those who face the risks of climate change.

He also cited artificial intelligence as holding significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency, distribution, and disaster management.",,N,,2025-08-25 07:03:35.109676

Where We Are a Service Provider

Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information or your precise geolocation information for timeclock tracking, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a ""data processor"" or ""service provider"" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Any use of analytics or engagement technologies that process personal data, including tools that analyze user behavior or associate usage with identifiers, are implemented solely as a data processor or service provider in these scenarios, and such data is not used by NEOGOV for its own commercial purposes. Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies. Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you. For example, a Customer may choose to enable collection of biometric or precise location data for its employees using our time and attendance product. We process such data only at the direction of that Customer and do not use it for our own purposes.

Further, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services.

Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer.

Cookies, pixel tags (“web beacons”), HTML Storage Objects, web tags, and embedded scripts within our communications and on our Services to collect data related to usage, location, device and logs.

Among other reasons, we use various cookies and other tracking technologies to provide our Services, authenticate users when visiting our Services, for security purposes (e.g., to prevent fraudulent use of the Services and protect our Services generally), track your preferences, provide personalized recommendations of content, features, and Services, deliver more relevant ads to you as you browse the web, including ads on websites and applications other than on our Services, and help us understand how our websites and communications are being used. For more information on Cookies see the “Cookies and similar Tracking Technologies; “Do Not Track” section immediately below.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies

We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.

HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.

Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the ""Help"" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Online Analytics and Advertising

Online Analytics

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics, Hubspot, LinkedIn, Hotjar, Gainsight and others. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.

In some cases, we may also associate analytics and usage data with identifiers such as your name or email address, but only as needed to enable our Customers to analyze user engagement, feature usage, or onboarding effectiveness. These tools are used solely on behalf of our Customers to support the Services they direct us to provide. For example, we use Gainsight to support in-product analytics and engagement, on behalf of our Customers, and subject to our role as a service provider.

Tailored Online Advertising

We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. These third-party advertising technologies may include Google Ads, DoubleClick, Twitter, AddThis, ShareThis, and others. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.

We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You can also use the options below in the ""Rights Regarding Your Information"" section below.

Please note that you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

We also receive your personal data described in this Policy from third party sources, including from your employer (our Customer), third party companies from which we purchase personal data, partners (including but not limited to partners listed on our Marketplace), accreditation agencies, and co-organizers and sponsors for our events and webinars.

If you sign into our Services with Facebook or other single sign on services, we import the requested data from your account.

Rights Regarding Your Information

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right, in accordance with applicable data protection laws, to make requests related to your “personal information” or “personal data” (as such terms are defined under applicable law, and collectively referred to herein as “personal information”). Specifically, you may have the right to ask us to:

Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information and Processing/Sharing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes

If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you may also have the right to opt out of “sales” of your information and “sharing/processing of your information for targeted advertising.”

As explained in the “When We Disclose Your Information” and ""Online Analytics and Advertising"" sections above, we sometimes disclose information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use advertising analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.

Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.

Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. The following chart details our practices in this regard.

For more information about each category, purpose of use, and the third parties to which we disclose or share information, please see the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” and “Information We Disclose” sections above.

Your Choices Regarding “Sharing” and “Selling”

You have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal information for purposes of certain online analytics and advertising by visiting ""Your Privacy Choices” which is available in the footer of our Services. Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.

If you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser, we recognize such preference in accordance with applicable law.

Additional California Privacy Rights

In addition to the rights set forth in the section above on “Your Choices Regarding ‘Sharing’ and ‘Selling,’” California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in the section above in our Privacy Policy on “Rights Regarding Your Information.”

The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes.

FAQs About Fluorspar in Electric Vehicles What is the difference between fluorspar and fluorine?","What is Fluorspar and Why is it Critical for Electric Vehicles?

Fluorspar, also known as fluorite, is a mineral composed of calcium fluoride (CaF₂) containing 51.1% calcium and 48.9% fluorine by weight. This mineral serves as the primary global source of fluorine for industrial applications, particularly in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle sector. Despite receiving less attention than lithium, fluorspar plays an equally crucial role in battery production.

The Chemical Composition and Properties of Fluorspar

Fluorspar is classified as calcium fluoride (CaF₂) and typically occurs in cubic crystals. These crystals can display a remarkable variety of colors including purple, blue, green, yellow, and completely colorless specimens. The mineral has a hardness of 4 on the Mohs scale and is characterized by its distinctive fluorescence under ultraviolet light—a property from which the element fluorine derives its name.

Commercial fluorspar is categorized into three main grades, each serving different industrial purposes:

Acid-grade (acidspar): Contains ≥97% CaF₂ and is primarily used for chemical applications, particularly in battery manufacturing

Metallurgical-grade: Contains 85-95% CaF₂ and is used in steel production as a flux to reduce melting points and remove impurities

Ceramic-grade: Contains 85-96% CaF₂ and is used in glass and enamel manufacturing to create opacity and improve durability

Historical Uses vs. Modern Applications in Clean Technology

Fluorspar has been utilized in industrial processes for centuries, with traditional applications centered around metallurgy and chemical manufacturing. Historical uses include:

Steel manufacturing, where it serves as a flux to reduce melting temperatures and remove impurities

Aluminum production, where it's used to lower the electrolytic bath's melting point

Refrigerant production, with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their replacements requiring fluorine derived from fluorspar

However, the growth trajectory of fluorspar demand has shifted dramatically with the rise of clean energy technologies. Modern applications that are driving increased demand include:

Lithium-ion battery manufacturing for electric vehicles and energy storage

Semiconductor production, where ultra-high purity hydrogen fluoride is essential for etching silicon wafers

Nuclear fuel processing, which requires uranium hexafluoride for enrichment

The U.S. Geological Survey has classified fluorspar as a critical mineral due to its essential role in clean energy technologies and potential supply chain vulnerabilities. As EV production scales up globally, critical minerals energy security continues to grow in parallel.

How Does Fluorspar Enable EV Battery Technology?

Fluorspar isn't merely an additive in lithium-ion batteries—it's a fundamental component used extensively throughout the battery production process, affecting multiple critical components that determine battery performance, safety, and longevity.

The Role of Fluorine in Battery Electrolytes

The electrolyte enables lithium ions to flow between the anode and cathode, making it essential for battery function. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF₆) is the predominant electrolyte salt used in commercial lithium-ion batteries, and its fluorine content comes directly from fluorspar.

Quantity required: A 100 kWh battery requires approximately 17.5-24 kg of LiPF₆

Fluorine content: This represents 13.1-18.1 kg of fluorine

Performance benefits: Enables optimal ionic conductivity (>10 mS/cm at room temperature) and electrochemical stability across a wide voltage window

Stability functions: Forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that protects the electrodes and prevents continuous electrolyte decomposition

Despite ongoing research into alternative electrolyte systems, battery industry experts confirm that fluorinated electrolytes remain superior for commercial applications due to their unique combination of properties. Major battery manufacturers including CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Samsung SDI continue to rely on LiPF₆-based electrolytes for their mainstream products.

Fluorinated Binders in Battery Electrode Manufacturing

To create functional electrodes, active materials must be bound together and attached to current collectors. This critical function relies on fluorinated polymers, particularly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).

Primary binder material: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)

Quantity in batteries: A 100 kWh battery uses approximately 6-8 kg of PVDF

Fluorine content: Contains 3.5-4.75 kg of fluorine

Key properties: Provides excellent adhesion to current collectors, chemical stability against electrolyte degradation, and electrochemical performance across wide temperature ranges (-40°C to +60°C)

PVDF's unique properties make it particularly well-suited for lithium-ion batteries. It remains stable in the presence of aggressive electrolyte components and doesn't degrade during charging and discharging cycles. This stability contributes significantly to battery longevity and safety.

Graphite Anode Purification Process

The graphite used in battery anodes must meet extremely high purity standards. This purification process relies heavily on hydrofluoric acid (HF) derived from fluorspar.

Purification method: Raw graphite is refined using hydrofluoric acid to remove silicate impurities

Consumption rate: Processing anodes for a 100 kWh battery requires 7.5-15 kg of HF

Fluorine content: Contains 7-14 kg of fluorine

Quality impact: Ensures the graphite meets the stringent purity requirements (>99.95%) for battery applications

The purification process is essential for producing battery-grade graphite that can withstand thousands of charge-discharge cycles. Impurities in the graphite would otherwise lead to capacity loss, reduced cycle life, and potential safety issues. While alternative purification methods are being researched, HF-based processes remain the industry standard for achieving the necessary purity levels.

Beyond these three primary applications, fluorinated compounds are also used in separator materials and as electrolyte additives that enhance battery performance and safety. The pervasive use of fluorine throughout the battery manufacturing process underscores fluorspar's critical role in enabling the electric vehicle revolution.

What Are the Quantitative Requirements for Fluorspar in EVs?

The scale of fluorspar demand for electric vehicle production is substantial and often underappreciated in discussions about battery materials. Concrete numbers reveal the magnitude of this requirement and help forecast future demand growth.

Fluorspar-to-Battery Capacity Ratio Analysis

A direct relationship exists between battery capacity and fluorspar requirements:

Conversion ratio: Approximately 1.1 kg of fluorspar is needed per 1 kWh of battery capacity

For a typical 100 kWh EV battery:

Total fluorine required: 31.1-51.7 kg (average of 41.4 kg)

Lithium content comparison: Approximately 11 kg of lithium

Raw fluorspar equivalent: Approximately 109.5 kg

This means a standard Tesla Model S with its 100 kWh battery pack requires roughly 110 kg of fluorspar just for battery production. This requirement is particularly striking when compared to lithium, the namesake element of lithium-ion batteries. By weight, a battery requires approximately four times more fluorine than lithium, highlighting fluorspar's overlooked importance in the supply chain.

Comparative Material Requirements in EV Batteries

Material Amount Required for 100 kWh Battery Primary Application Fluorspar ~109.5 kg Multiple battery components Lithium ~11 kg Cathode active material Graphite ~70-100 kg Anode material Nickel ~40-80 kg (depending on chemistry) Cathode material Cobalt ~4-30 kg (depending on chemistry) Cathode material

This comparison illustrates that fluorspar requirements are substantial compared to other critical battery materials. Different battery chemistries also impact fluorspar demand in varying ways:

LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries still require similar amounts of fluorine for electrolytes and binders, even with their cobalt-free chemistry

NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) batteries use comparable fluorine quantities but have different overall material profiles

Solid-state batteries under development may actually increase fluorine requirements due to specialized fluorinated interface materials

Forecasting Future Demand Based on EV Growth Projections

Current global EV battery production: ~500 GWh (2023)

Projected global capacity by 2030: 3-4 TWh according to BloombergNEF's New Energy Outlook 2023

Corresponding fluorspar demand: 3.3-4.4 million tonnes annually for EV batteries alone

Compound annual growth rate (CAGR): Estimated at 25-30% through 2030

These projections indicate that EV battery production alone could require 3-4 million tonnes of fluorspar annually by 2030, representing a significant portion of current global production (approximately 7 million tonnes according to the U.S. Geological Survey). This growth trajectory creates both challenges and opportunities for the fluorspar supply chain.

Regional demand forecasts show particular concentration in areas with rapidly growing EV manufacturing capacity:

China: Projected to require 1.5-2 million tonnes annually by 2030

Europe: Estimated demand of 0.8-1.2 million tonnes annually by 2030

North America: Forecasted demand of 0.6-0.9 million tonnes annually by 2030

The fluorine intensity of batteries is significantly higher than most other critical minerals on a per-kWh basis, creating a substantial but often overlooked demand driver for global fluorspar markets.

Why is Fluorspar Supply Chain Security Becoming Critical?

As electric vehicle adoption accelerates globally, securing stable supplies of fluorspar has become a strategic priority for manufacturers and governments alike. Several factors contribute to the growing concern about fluorspar supply chain security.

Global Production and Concentration Risks

The global fluorspar market faces significant concentration risks that could impact availability and pricing:

Top producing countries: China (60% of global production), Mexico (15%), Mongolia (~5%)

Supply vulnerabilities: Geographic concentration, export restrictions, processing bottlenecks

Price volatility: Historical fluctuations of 30-40% annually based on supply constraints

China's dominance in fluorspar production creates particular concern, especially given past precedents with export quotas and restrictions on other critical minerals. The U.S. Geological Survey reports that China has implemented export controls on fluorspar in the past, creating price spikes and supply uncertainty for international buyers.

Beyond raw material production, the processing infrastructure for converting fluorspar to battery-grade fluorine compounds is even more concentrated. High-purity hydrogen fluoride production, a key intermediate step, requires specialized equipment and expertise that exists in a limited number of facilities globally.

Environmental Considerations in Fluorspar Mining

Environmental factors also affect the security and sustainability of fluorspar supply:

Water usage: Processing requires significant water resources, typically 3-5 cubic meters per tonne of concentrate

Waste management: Tailings contain potential contaminants requiring careful containment

Land reclamation: Post-mining restoration presents challenges, particularly for open-pit operations

Regulatory landscape: Increasingly stringent environmental standards affecting production costs and project development timelines

Environmental scientists note that responsible fluorspar mining can be achieved with proper water management and waste containment systems. However, implementing these best practices adds to production costs and may limit the development of new deposits in environmentally sensitive areas.

Strategic Initiatives for Supply Chain Resilience

In response to these challenges, various stakeholders are pursuing initiatives to enhance fluorspar supply chain security:

Domestic resource development: Nations including the U.S., Canada, and European critical materials countries are actively supporting exploration and development of local fluorspar resources

Recycling potential: Research into technologies for fluorine recovery from spent batteries and other fluorine-containing waste streams

Substitution research: Ongoing efforts to reduce fluorine dependency in battery technologies, though commercial viability remains distant

Strategic reserves: Consideration of stockpiling programs similar to those established for rare earths and other critical minerals

The U.S. Department of Energy identifies fluorspar as a critical material for clean energy supply chains, while the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act 2023 includes fluorspar in its list of strategic raw materials. These designations have prompted increased government support for domestic fluorspar project development.

Transportation and logistics considerations further complicate fluorspar supply security. The mineral's relatively low value-to-weight ratio makes long-distance transportation economically challenging, creating advantages for deposits located near processing facilities or end-users. This factor has prompted interest in developing integrated supply chains that minimize transportation requirements.

How Are Battery Technologies Evolving Regarding Fluorspar Use?

The battery industry continues to evolve, with implications for future fluorspar in electric vehicles demand patterns. Research and development efforts are exploring various approaches to battery chemistry, some of which could affect fluorine requirements.

Next-Generation Battery Chemistries and Fluorine Requirements

Different emerging battery technologies have varying implications for fluorspar demand:

Solid-state batteries: May require different fluorinated compounds but potentially in higher quantities due to specialized fluorinated interface materials

Sodium-ion batteries: Currently still utilize fluorinated electrolytes and binders similar to lithium-ion batteries

Lithium-sulfur: Reduced fluorine requirements per kWh but still dependent on fluorinated components for stability

Flow batteries: Generally lower fluorine intensity per kWh but face challenges in mobile applications

Battery researchers acknowledge that while progress is being made on alternative electrolyte systems, fluorinated compounds remain superior for commercial applications in the near term. Major battery manufacturers are investing billions in research and development, but fluorine-free batteries are not expected to reach commercial scale before 2030 for most applications.

The U.S. Department of Energy's ARPA-E program has funded several research initiatives focused on developing fluorine-free battery technologies, recognizing both the supply chain vulnerabilities and environmental considerations associated with fluorinated compounds. However, these alternatives typically face performance trade-offs, particularly in energy density, cycle life, or operational temperature range.

Recycling and Circular Economy Approaches

Recycling presents another pathway to reducing primary fluorspar demand:

Current status: Limited commercial-scale fluorine recovery from batteries

Technological barriers: Complex separation of fluorinated compounds from mixed waste streams

Economic factors: Recovery economics improving with scale and technology advancements

Regulatory drivers: Emerging battery recycling mandates in EU, Asia, and North America

Battery recycling innovations are advancing rapidly, but most current processes focus on recovering high-value metals like cobalt, nickel, and lithium rather than fluorinated compounds. The relatively low value of fluorine compared to these metals has limited investment in fluorine recovery technologies. However, as battery volumes increase and processing technologies improve, the economics of fluorine recovery are expected to become more favorable.

The European Union's proposed Battery Regulation includes specific targets for recovery of battery materials, which could drive increased investment in technologies that can recover fluorinated compounds from end-of-life batteries. Similar regulatory frameworks are being considered in other regions, potentially accelerating the development of circular economy approaches for fluorine.

Research Directions for Reducing Fluorine Dependency

Several research avenues are being pursued to reduce fluorine requirements in batteries:

Alternative binders: Water-based binders showing promise for specific applications, particularly in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries

Novel electrolytes: Research into non-fluorinated ionic liquids and polymer electrolytes

Process innovations: Less fluorine-intensive graphite purification methods using alternative acids or thermal treatments

Performance trade-offs: Balancing reduced fluorine use against battery performance metrics such as energy density, cycle life, and safety

Technical comparisons show that current fluorine-free alternatives typically face performance limitations. For example, aqueous electrolytes offer improved safety but operate in a narrower voltage window, reducing energy density. Similarly, alternative binders may provide adequate adhesion but often show reduced chemical stability or temperature tolerance compared to PVDF.

While complete elimination of fluorine from battery technologies remains a long-term research goal, incremental reductions through optimized formulations and processing techniques offer more immediate potential for reducing fluorspar demand per kWh of battery capacity.

What Does the Investment Landscape Look Like for Fluorspar?

The growing recognition of fluorspar's importance to the energy transition is creating new investment opportunities and challenges. Understanding the development timeline, economics, and risk factors is essential for stakeholders considering involvement in this sector.

Emerging Fluorspar Projects and Development Timelines

Several regions are seeing increased activity in fluorspar project development:

North America: Projects under development in Canada, Mexico, and the United States aim to reduce import dependency

Europe: Exploration and development initiatives in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom support EU critical minerals strategy

Australia: Emerging projects linked to broader critical minerals strategies and Asian market access

Development timeline: Typically 5-8 years from discovery to production for major fluorspar projects

The capital requirements for developing new fluorspar projects vary significantly based on scale, location, and processing requirements. Major projects typically require $100-500 million in capital investment according to mining industry estimates. This substantial capital requirement creates barriers to entry, particularly for junior mining companies.

The permitting process for fluorspar projects can be complex due to the mineral's chemical properties and potential environmental impacts. Environmental permitting typically requires comprehensive water management plans, tailings storage facility designs, and mine reclamation innovation strategies. These factors contribute to the extended development timeline for new projects.

Integration with Broader Critical Minerals Strategies

Fluorspar is increasingly included in national critical minerals policies:

National policies: Inclusion in critical minerals lists in US, EU, Japan, and Australia

Financial incentives: Tax benefits, grants, and loan guarantees for domestic production

Supply chain mapping: Increasing focus on tracking fluorine from mine to battery

International partnerships: Emerging government-to-government agreements on mineral security

The U.S. Defense Production Act provides funding mechanisms for critical mineral projects, including those focused on fluorspar and downstream fluorine compounds. Similar programs exist in the European Union under the European Raw Materials Alliance and in Japan through JOGMEC (Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation).

These government initiatives are creating more favorable conditions for fluorspar project development, particularly for projects located in regions seeking to reduce import dependency. Mining industry analysts note increasing investor interest in fluorspar projects due to these policy supports combined with projected demand growth from the EV sector.

Risk Assessment for Fluorspar-Dependent Industries

Investors and industrial consumers of fluorspar must consider several risk factors:

Supply disruption scenarios: Potential production impacts from supply constraints

Price sensitivity: Battery cost implications of fluorspar price volatility

Technological obsolescence: Monitoring alternative technologies that could reduce demand

Regulatory considerations: Evolving environmental standards affecting production and use

Battery manufacturers and automotive companies are increasingly including fluorspar in their supply chain risk assessments. Some are pursuing vertical integration strategies or long-term supply agreements to mitigate these risks. Others are supporting research into alternative technologies that could reduce their exposure to fluorspar supply constraints.

Project financing for fluorspar developments faces particular challenges due to the mineral's relatively low profile compared to other battery metals investment options. Educating investors about fluorspar's critical role in the EV supply chain remains an ongoing challenge for project developers. However, increasing awareness of supply chain vulnerabilities is gradually improving the financing environment for well-positioned projects.

How Can the Fluorspar Supply Chain Support Sustainable EV Growth?

Ensuring adequate and sustainable fluorspar supplies will be crucial to meeting ambitious electric vehicle adoption targets. This requires balancing production expansion with environmental stewardship and technological innovation.

Balancing Supply Expansion with Environmental Stewardship

Sustainable development of fluorspar resources requires attention to environmental impacts:

Best practices in mining: Water recycling, energy efficiency, and waste minimization

Processing innovations: Less chemical-intensive beneficiation methods

Certification schemes: Emerging standards for responsibly produced fluorspar

Life cycle assessment: Comprehensive environmental footprint analysis

Environmental scientists note that fluorspar mining typically has a lower carbon intensity than many other critical minerals. However, water management remains a particular challenge for fluorspar operations. Advanced water recycling technologies can significantly reduce freshwater consumption, with some modern operations achieving water recycling rates above 80%.

Proper handling of fluorine-bearing wastes requires specialized containment systems to prevent environmental contamination. Tailings storage facility design has advanced significantly in recent years, with increased focus on long-term stability and minimizing seepage risks. These improvements contribute to more sustainable operations but also increase capital and operating costs.

Technological Innovations in Fluorspar Processing

Several technological advances are improving the efficiency and sustainability of fluorspar production:

Improved recovery rates: Advanced flotation and separation technologies increasing yield from ore

By-product recovery: Extracting valuable co-products like rare earths from fluorspar ores

Energy efficiency: Reducing the carbon footprint of processing through equipment optimization

Modular processing: Smaller, more flexible processing facilities that can be located closer to mines

Advanced sensor-based sorting technologies allow for more precise separation of fluorspar from waste rock, reducing the amount of material that requires energy-intensive processing. Some operations report 15-20% reductions in energy consumption through the implementation of these technologies.

The recovery of valuable by-products can significantly improve the economics of fluorspar operations. Many fluorspar deposits contain rare earth elements, barite, or other valuable minerals that can be recovered through modified processing circuits. This co-production model enhances resource efficiency and economic viability.

Policy Recommendations for Sustainable Development

Policy frameworks can support sustainable fluorspar development:

Resource mapping: Comprehensive geological surveys to identify new deposits

Permitting efficiency: Streamlined but rigorous approval processes

Research funding: Support for fluorine efficiency and recycling technologies

International standards: Harmonized approach to responsible production

Government geological surveys play a crucial role in identifying and characterizing potential fluorspar resources. Enhanced funding for these activities can accelerate the discovery of new deposits, particularly in regions seeking to develop domestic supply chains.

Permitting processes that are both efficient and environmentally rigorous are essential for responsible resource development. Some jurisdictions are implementing ""one-stop-shop"" permitting approaches that coordinate multiple regulatory requirements while maintaining high environmental standards.

Research funding for technologies that improve fluorine efficiency in batteries or enable fluorine recovery from waste streams can support long-term sustainability goals. Public-private partnerships have proven effective in accelerating these technology developments.

International standards for responsible fluorspar production could help ensure that increased production doesn't come at the expense of environmental or social values. Industry associations and multilateral organizations are beginning to develop such standards, though implementation remains at an early stage.

FAQs About Fluorspar in Electric Vehicles

What is the difference between fluorspar and fluorine?

Fluorspar is the mineral form of calcium fluoride (CaF₂), while fluorine is the elemental form (F) that is extracted from fluorspar for industrial applications. Fluorspar serves as the commercial source material from which fluorine compounds are produced for various uses, including EV batteries. The mineral contains 48.9% fluorine by weight, making it the most economical source of this reactive element for industrial purposes.

Can fluorspar be recycled from used EV batteries?

While technically possible, commercial-scale recycling of fluorine compounds from EV batteries remains limited. Current battery recycling focuses primarily on recovering valuable metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. The relatively low value of fluorine compounds compared to these metals has limited investment in fluorine recovery technologies. However, as battery volumes increase and technologies improve, fluorine recovery is expected to become more economically viable. Emerging EU battery regulations may accelerate this development by establishing specific recovery targets for battery materials.

Are there alternatives to fluorspar in battery production?

Research is ongoing into alternative battery chemistries that reduce or eliminate fluorine dependency. However, current commercial lithium-ion batteries still rely heavily on fluorinated components for optimal performance. Complete substitution remains a long-term research goal rather than an immediate solution. Alternative electrolyte systems face challenges in matching the performance of fluorinated electrolytes, particularly in terms of electrochemical stability, conductivity, and temperature range. Similarly, alternative binders typically show reduced chemical stability or temperature tolerance compared to fluorinated polymers.

How does fluorspar mining impact the environment?

Fluorspar mining can have environmental impacts including water usage, potential acid mine drainage, and habitat disruption. However, modern mining practices implement various mitigation measures such as water recycling, progressive reclamation, and tailings management to minimize these impacts. The environmental footprint of fluorspar mining is typically lower than that of many other critical minerals in terms of carbon intensity, but water management remains a particular challenge. Advances in water recycling technologies have enabled significant reductions in freshwater consumption at modern operations.

Will fluorspar become a supply bottleneck for EV production?

Without significant investment in new production capacity, fluorspar could potentially constrain EV manufacturing growth. However, increased awareness of its importance is driving exploration and development of new sources, which could alleviate potential supply constraints if developed in a timely manner. The typical 5-8 year development timeline for new fluorspar projects means that investments made now will be crucial to meeting projected demand in the 2030 timeframe. Government support through critical minerals strategies is helping to accelerate some project developments, particularly in regions seeking to reduce import dependency.

,American Energy,2025-08-25 07:33:11+00:00,Canary Media,US solar plant construction is on a record-breaking spree — for now - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/us-construction-record-breaking,"As it stands, the power industry is building more solar than any other type of power plant, which has been the case for several years running.
Solar thus will contribute more than half of the expected 64 gigawatts of new power capacity additions this year.
Moreover, 2025 could set the U.S. record for new power-plant construction, beating the 58 gigawatts added in 2002 at the height of a natural-gas plant boom.
There’s little hope that the pace of gas-plant construction will match the current one for solar installations.
Absent some reworking of U.S. energy policy, the country is heading for a time of decreasing power-plant construction just when we desperately need it to accelerate.","The U.S. is still on track to build a record amount of new solar capacity this year, even as the Trump administration works to obstruct renewables.

As it stands, the power industry is building more solar than any other type of power plant, which has been the case for several years running. Roughly 12 gigawatts of new solar capacity joined the grid in the first half of the year, and 21 gigawatts more are slated for completion by the end of the year, according to a recent survey by the federal Energy Information Administration.

Solar thus will contribute more than half of the expected 64 gigawatts of new power capacity additions this year. Adding in battery storage and wind installations, clean energy is on track to deliver 93% of new power-plant capacity this year, the EIA predicted in February. Moreover, 2025 could set the U.S. record for new power-plant construction, beating the 58 gigawatts added in 2002 at the height of a natural-gas plant boom.

Those facts reflect a set of hopeful trends: The U.S. is building power plants at a record pace; nearly all of those new plants will not emit carbon emissions; and, since renewables and batteries cost far less to operate than fossil fuel plants, they exert downward pressure on electricity costs. These are all good things to see at a time when demand for new power production is soaring — thanks to electrification, industrial growth, and an AI computing bubble — and consumers are grappling with steadily rising electricity rates.

Of course, these trends could prove short-lived, because the Trump administration is actively working to obstruct the buildout of clean and cheap energy.

This summer’s signature Republican domestic policy law targeted wind and solar with early termination of their tax credits, effectively raising the cost to deploy these types of power plants. The executive branch has sought to halt or inhibit offshore wind and renewable development on public lands. Simultaneously, the Trump administration is giving an artificial boost to fossil-fuel plants. The Department of Energy is invoking emergency powers to block the planned shutdown of the J.H. Cambpell coal-fired plant in Michigan, forcing customers to pay millions of dollars extra to preserve an outdated, uneconomical facility. Analysts fear the DOE could repeat this tactic with other uneconomic fossil-burning plants that are scheduled to retire.

Any clean power plants coming online this year were planned, permitted, and undergoing construction before Trump’s policy shifts took effect (though his officials have found ways to interrupt construction that was fully permitted, like the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York). In that sense, this year’s buildout offers the last snapshot of what it looks like when the electricity industry serves market demand with modern technologies absent active resistance from the U.S. government.

It’s still possible that momentum will carry the solar industry to another record year in 2026. Developers effectively need to start construction by the first half of 2026 to claim the full tax credit, and the administration recently tightened the longstanding tax rules on what counts as ​“starting,” further upping the pressure to get going. Historically, an impending tax-credit cliff incites a temporary rush to begin solar projects in time to qualify.

It will take a few years, then, for the Trump-era energy policies to fully remake the market landscape for solar.

These energy infrastructures aim for a combined capacity of 50 megawatts (MW), distributed across four sites: Bohicon, Parakou, Djougou, and Natitingou. According to the project leaders, this initiative is part of Benin’s efforts to diversify its energy mix.

The national target, set at 30% renewables by 2030, remains ambitious for a country where current production relies on about 16% renewable sources. This project adds to other solar and wind initiatives launched in recent years, reflecting growing interest in decentralizing energy production.

Geographic distribution and energy coverage

The four plants will be located in strategic areas of the country to optimize electricity distribution and access. Bohicon, Parakou, Djougou, and Natitingou were selected for their solar radiation potential and their role in structuring the national grid. According to estimates by Axian Energy and Sika Capital, these infrastructures could meet the electricity needs of nearly 50,000 households.

Electricity coverage in Benin is currently estimated at 42%, with significant disparities between urban centers and rural areas. These territorial imbalances pose a challenge for national energy planning and universal access policies.

India has become the world’s 3rd-largest solar energy producer, doubled its solar manufacturing capacity and achieved its COP26 renewable energy target five years ahead of its Paris agreement goal, with renewables now powering over 50 per cent of the country’s total installed electricity generation capacity of 484.82 GW.

After crossing 100 GW of solar power, the country is on track to reach 500 GW of clean energy by 2030 and net-zero by 2070. Projects like large solar parks, rooftop solar, and the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana are helping households become self-reliant in energy.

India’s energy journey over the past decade reflects a strategic shift towards self-reliance, sustainability, and innovation. From green hydrogen to solar rooftops, rural electrification to digital procurement, every initiative underscores India’s vision of inclusive, secure, and clean energy for all.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India generated an impressive 1,08,494 GWh of solar energy, leaving Japan behind at 96,459 GWh.

India’s cumulative solar power capacity stood at 119.02 GW as of July 2025. This includes 90.99 GW from ground-mounted solar plants, 19.88 GW from grid-connected rooftop systems, 3.06 GW from hybrid projects, and 5.09 GW from off-grid solar installations, reflecting the country’s diverse approach to expanding renewable energy.

India’s progress in the renewable energy sector reflects the country’s focused policies and strategic planning.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi added momentum to the drive with his approach, highlighting that “Green Future, Net Zero aren’t just fancy words but reflect India’s need and commitment, making it the best destination for investment and innovation in renewable energy.”

India lies in the tropical region, with the Tropic of Cancer passing through many states. This gives the country a high potential for solar power generation.

The total solar sector potential of the Indian continent is 748 GW. States and UTs like Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh have some of the highest solar potential in the country, making them key drivers of India’s clean energy growth.

Region-wise, the major high-potential states include Northern and Western Rajasthan, Southern Gujarat, Central Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Eastern and Other Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha.

In July 2025, India’s solar power capacity had increased by 4,000 per cent, and the country’s total renewable energy capacity reached 227 GW. Palli village in Jammu and Kashmir became a notable example, emerging as India’s first carbon-neutral panchayat by running entirely on solar power.

Emphasis was placed on the need for energy storage and the adoption of new technologies to meet future energy demands. Government schemes like the PM Surya Ghar Yojana and PM Kusum Yojana are playing a key role in helping households and farmers transition to clean solar energy.

Yet this vast body of water – covering nearly three-quarters of Earth – could be the key to solving two of the largest environmental challenges the world faces: weaning off fossil fuels in favor of green energy sources on top of absorbing existing carbon emissions from the air.

At least, that’s what Equatic is banking on for the future.

The Santa Monica-based clean energy company announced in mid-August it raised $11.6 million in series A funding. The round was led by Catalytic Capital for Climate and Health, a division of Singapore-based Temasek Trust, and climate-focused private investment firm Kibo Invest.

“Truly innovative carbon management technologies are needed to mitigate climate change before the consequences become irreversible,” John Browne, the chairman of Equatic’s advisory board, said in a statement.

“By removing carbon dioxide and simultaneously generating green hydrogen, Equatic’s solution provides unique advantages in terms of cost and scalability,” said Browne, who is also the former chief executive of British Petroleum and a founder of venture firm BeyondNetZero,

Equatic’s proprietary platform captures carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and in turn produces green hydrogen using one single process that can be scaled. The process is meant to boost the ocean’s natural ability to draw in copious levels of carbon, store it permanently and in turn produce hydrogen. Not to minimize the ocean’s competence, but Equatic says its commercial plants can absorb carbon 99,000 times faster than the ocean, which covers 71% of the globe. The process works by pumping seawater and splitting it, isolating the hydrogen, oxygen, acid and base using renewable electricity.

“Truly scalable climate solutions must work with nature,” Equatic’s website states. “The power of the ocean is in its chemistry. This chemistry endows the ocean with an unrivaled capacity to drawdown and permanently store anthropogenic carbon.”

A technology revival

While the ocean is an efficient – not to mention free – carbon sink, it disappointingly cannot scale or provide proprietary data insights the way many of these startups do. Equatic’s on-land plants are designed to accurately measure how much carbon dioxide is being removed from the atmosphere, a key metric for buyers that need to follow various government regulations on improving their carbon footprint.

As the likes of South Africa, the European Union, China, Kenya and Australia develop strict carbon footprint regulations, the need for carbon measuring and carbon removal technology has only grown. As of August, the sector has raised more than $373 million in venture funding – nearly double of what was raised in the entirety of 2024, according to PitchBook. Culver City-based Clairity Technology, an air capture carbon dioxide removal startup, raised nearly $6.8 million in seed funding in February. Carbon Ridge, a Santa Monica-based maritime carbon removal startup, announced in August it deployed the industry’s first centrifugal-based onboard carbon capture system on a shipping vessel. This was months after the International Maritime Organization voted to adopt a global policy regulation that would require ship owners to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65% in 2040.

“There’s now an effective stick, essentially, that is requiring vessel owners and operators to reduce their emissions,” said Chase Dwyer, the chief executive of Carbon Ridge. “And so now they’re looking at: what is the lowest cost way for us to do that, and the most environmentally impactful?”",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PG10_Equatic_LABJ_plants_lead_Equatic.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 04:00:27.818087

As renewable energy gains momentum, companies face prolonged, costly and complicated processes that act as barriers to prompt deployment.

Microsoft has been exploring ways in which technology can help to streamline this process and get more clean energy installations off the ground.

The concept originated during a hackathon event hosted by Microsoft, where developers and innovative thinkers brainstormed software improvements.

Since then, the tech giant has begun investing time and resources into revolutionising permitting using Gen AI.

For this project, Microsoft's team has put a special focus on nuclear power where planning and permitting can take more than a decade and cost millions of dollars.

""Permitting is the single biggest bottleneck to deploying clean energy fast enough to avoid runaway climate change,"" Microsoft says of the issue.

""That's not just inefficient – it's existential.""

Collaboration and innovation

The project's origins trace back to a 2022 gathering of the Repowering Coal Consortium at Microsoft's Dublin offices.

Fifty industry representatives from across the advanced nuclear sector identified permitting as a critical obstacle to scaling nuclear deployment from one reactor per decade in the Western world to the 2,500 needed globally to replace coal power.

Mark Tipping, Global Offshore Power to X Director at Lloyd's Register, believes this initiative will be hugely impactful.

""Together, we're tackling one of the biggest challenges in deploying nuclear technology, which is navigating complex, slow and costly licensing processes,"" he says.

The technical breakthrough

The team initially attempted to solve permitting challenges using traditional software approaches but found the problem intractable.

Conor Kelly, a key team member, explains: ""We first started trying without Gen AI... just normal software programming. It was an intractable problem.""

The breakthrough came with the realisation that generative AI could interact with vast datasets and format content as needed by varied licensing documents.

The combination of Azure OpenAI and Kernel Memory now allows for the rapid creation of draft permitting documents, reducing a process that once took extensive time down to mere minutes.

Microsoft's structured approach

The solution addresses three core challenges in the permitting process.

Automated document creation uses Gen AI to draft permitting documents from historical and project-specific data.

A Copilot system provides permitting engineers with access to entire regulatory datasets through ad-hoc queries, running entirely on companies' own Azure tenants to prevent data leakage.

Pre-submission review capabilities flag missing information before formal submission, reducing costly delays with regulators.

Delivering a measurable impact

The introduction of AI-driven permitting has resulted in productivity gains of 25-75% in energy project workflows.

Ed Essey, Senior Director of Business Value at Microsoft, believes this project speaks to the importance of pursuing ideas with curiosity and an open mind.

""It's incredible to see that what began as a side project got Microsoft into nuclear,"" he says.

​The report outlines strategies to expand the adoption of Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) across all vehicle types, including school buses, as part of the state’s broader effort to combat air pollution and climate change.
​ The report highlights California’s leadership in clean transportation, noting that the state has already surpassed its goal of deploying 2 million ZEVs.
The CARB report also notes 17 other states and the District of Columbia have chosen to adopt at least part of California’s vehicle standards.
In addition, three of these states have established complementary regulations similar to California’s LCFS to further advance the clean vehicle market.","A new report reaffirms California’s commitment to zero-emission vehicle adoption and deployment despite attempts by Congress and the Trump administration to remove federal waivers that provide the state authority to cut pollution levels within its borders and elsewhere.

The state currently is involved in multiple lawsuits challenging the administration’s efforts to revoke the waivers approved by the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency and others.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released the report last week in response to Gov. Gavin Executive Order N-27-25 in June that directs CARB and several other state agencies to recommend strategies that make clean transportation more affordable, reliable and accessible. ​The report outlines strategies to expand the adoption of Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) across all vehicle types, including school buses, as part of the state’s broader effort to combat air pollution and climate change. ​

The report highlights California’s leadership in clean transportation, noting that the state has already surpassed its goal of deploying 2 million ZEVs. ​With 56 ZEV manufacturers operating in the state and nearly 178,000 public or shared private electric vehicle chargers installed, California is setting the pace for the nation. ​

However, the CARB report notes that five of the 10 most polluted cities in the U.S. are in California, and millions of residents still live in areas with dangerously high ozone levels, especially in the Los Angeles area and the San Joaquin Valley. ​

To address these challenges, CARB recommends actions across six key areas: Private investment, incentives, infrastructure, fuel pricing, regulations, and procurement. CARB seeks to sustain the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program that utilizes credits from 200 participating companies and from utilities to subsidize clean fuels like renewable diesel and to continue taking advantage of other existing funding programs. It recommends backfilling the federal clean air vehicle tax credits that are set to expire at the end of next month and providing “reliable and consistent funding” to the agency and the California Energy Commission for ZEV deployment and infrastructure incentive programs.

Noting that infrastructure remains one of the largest barriers to ZEV adoption, the report highlights the need for increased reliability of and access to EV chargers, including timely repair. CARB also recommends streamlining permitting processes and utility energization timelines. This includes implementing flexible service connections and other strategies to eliminate delays in EV charging installation.

CARB also calls for unlocking the benefits of V2G by improving the energization process to enable vehicles to power homes and businesses or to export power to the grid during peak demand periods. This includes developing utility rates “that align EV charging and discharging with grid needs” and establishing incentives to automakers that build EVs that can provide backup power. CARB also writes that standards are needed for chargers to enable the use of vehicle-grid integration.

School buses are directly impacted by the state’s push for ZEV adoption. The report emphasizes the need for incentives and infrastructure to support the transition to zero-emission buses. ​For school districts, this could mean additional access to funding programs that make it easier to replace aging diesel buses with electric or even hydrogen-powered alternatives. ​Additionally, CARB says the focus on building reliable charging infrastructure could alleviate concerns about fueling capacity and range limitations. ​

For companies operating school buses, the report’s recommendations present both opportunities and challenges. The emphasis on private investment through programs like the LCFS could provide financial incentives for operators to transition their fleets. ​Additionally, the state’s focus on workforce development could help create a pipeline of skilled workers to maintain and operate ZEVs. ​

However, the transition will require careful planning. CARB states operators will need to navigate new regulations, invest in charging or fueling infrastructure and ensure their fleets meet the state’s reliability and durability standards. Collaboration with state agencies and local governments will be key to overcoming these hurdles.

The CARB report also notes 17 other states and the District of Columbia have chosen to adopt at least part of California’s vehicle standards. The demand in these states for clean transportation collectively represents 40 percent of the nation’s new light-duty vehicle market and 25 percent of the nation’s new heavy-duty vehicle market, which are three to four times that of California alone. In addition, three of these states have established complementary regulations similar to California’s LCFS to further advance the clean vehicle market.",https://i0.wp.com/stnonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-School-Bus_STN-Website.png?fit=32%2C32&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-25 04:00:19.389082

New Delhi [India], August 25: Coca-Cola, along with its bottling partners, is redefining green logistics by expanding one of the nation's largest truck fleets, featuring over 5,000 EVs nationwide. This strategic investment not only delivers refreshment to every corner of India but also fuels job creation and underscores a commitment to operational excellence and social impact.

Nationwide Fleet Expansion Powers Growth and Opportunity

Coca-Cola's products traverse several hundred kilometers daily, reaching both urban and rural markets efficiently. This vast distribution network relies on a dedicated workforce of thousands of truck drivers, whose roles are pivotal in ensuring the timely delivery of beverages across the country.

A New Engine of Growth for Northwest Louisiana Project Cypress positions Louisiana to compete in a global industry worth more than $135 billion.
Project Cypress demonstrates how federal support and private innovation can create new industries, generate jobs, and keep America ahead of global competitors.
With strong leadership from Governor Landry, bold vision from President Trump, and Louisiana’s congressional delegation fighting for us, Project Cypress will become a global model for American innovation, industrial strength, and energy leadership.
When Louisiana leads, America wins – and with Project Cypress, we can lead today while building a stronger, more competitive energy future for generations to come.","Louisiana has always powered America – from offshore rigs to refineries to the plants that fuel our nation’s economy. At Heirloom, we’re proud to help write the next chapter by bringing new technologies that capture and commoditize carbon dioxide to help position Louisiana to lead the next great energy revolution, securing jobs, lifting rural communities, and keeping Louisiana competitive for decades.

President Trump has called for a new “Golden Era of American Energy Dominance,” urging the nation to unlock its full potential through expanded production and accelerated innovation. Governor Landry is advancing that vision with policies that drive energy growth and industrial innovation across Louisiana, laying the foundation for projects that strengthen America’s energy and industrial security.

One of the most promising examples is our participation in Project Cypress in Northwest Louisiana. At the Port of Caddo-Bossier where we’re building one of the nation’s first large-scale Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities. Using our advanced technology, we will transform carbon dioxide into a high-value resource for fuels, materials, and manufacturing to strengthen Louisiana's new and existing industries, from AI to energy. With support from President Trump’s Department of Energy, Project Cypress will drive hundreds of millions in private investment and create high-wage jobs – exactly the kind of growth rural Louisiana parishes need to strengthen their tax base to fix schools and roads, and build stronger communities.

A New Engine of Growth for Northwest Louisiana

Project Cypress positions Louisiana to compete in a global industry worth more than $135 billion. This combined investment will spark a new wave of industry, turning captured carbon into opportunities that power advanced manufacturing, new fuels and stronger energy production that achieve the same prosperity that Louisianans have secured for generations.

Big players are already investing. We’re working with partners like United Airlines to advance next-generation aviation fuels. And tech companies driving the AI revolution are among our largest customers, using DAC to balance the energy intensity of data centers. These partnerships show that the world’s leading companies believe in what we are building here in Louisiana.

Smart federal policy set the stage – from granting Louisiana the authority to manage carbon storage to new incentives that drive private investment. Now it’s Louisiana’s turn to seize this opportunity, build the industries of the future, and create thousands of jobs.

Strong Leadership in Louisiana and Washington

This progress would not be possible without champions at every level.

With strong leadership from Governor Jeff Landry, support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, and bold vision for American energy competitiveness from President Trump, Louisiana has the champions it needs to ensure job-creators like us can succeed. Their leadership creates the conditions for innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness – and we’re proud to be part of that momentum.

Together, their leadership ensures Louisiana remains at the forefront of industrial growth, creating new industries and opportunities for generations to come.

A Model for National Security and Global Competitiveness

Project Cypress is strategically co-located with pipelines and industrial corridors to reduce costs and accelerate deployment – the same way Louisiana’s LNG boom was built. Once again, Louisiana is proving that energy dominance starts here, showing the nation how to lead an energy revolution from the ground up.

In a world where competitors are positioning against us, America cannot afford to fall behind. By embracing DAC as part of our energy mix; we’re strengthening national security – ensuring that the United States – not foreign adversaries – controls the technologies that will fuel industry and shape global energy production for decades to come.

We started Heirloom because we believe this is how America wins: by building the industries of the future around the strengths we already possess. Louisiana understands energy abundance, knows how to build resilient infrastructure, and has the skilled workforce to match. The same formula that made it a leader in oil, gas, and LNG will make it a leader in the next chapter of American energy.

Louisiana’s Next Chapter

Energy dominance is not a slogan. It’s a strategy – and it is being built right here in Louisiana. Project Cypress demonstrates how federal support and private innovation can create new industries, generate jobs, and keep America ahead of global competitors. While China and Europe are racing ahead with major investments, Heirloom is committed to ensuring that America leads this critical frontier.

Now is the time to double down. With strong leadership from Governor Landry, bold vision from President Trump, and Louisiana’s congressional delegation fighting for us, Project Cypress will become a global model for American innovation, industrial strength, and energy leadership.

We’re proud to be investing in Northwest Louisiana and partnering with local communities to build the industries of tomorrow.

In this context, BBVA is positioning itself as a key player in the energy transition, supporting clients with sustainable financing solutions and specialized advisory services tailored to today's challenges.
One of the leaders driving this momentum is Isidoro del Álamo, Head of Sustainability & Low Carbon Advisory at BBVA Corporate & Investment Banking.
The future of energy Is already underway For Isidoro del Álamo, the energy transition is a historic opportunity.
With teams like the one led by Isidoro del Álamo, BBVA positions itself as a strategic partner for companies committed to a low-carbon future.","The energy transition is no longer a challenge exclusive to the energy sector—it has become a cross-cutting priority affecting the entire global economy. The need to reduce CO₂ emissions is pushing industries of all kinds—from manufacturing and transportation to agriculture and services—to transform their processes toward more sustainable models. In this context, BBVA is positioning itself as a key player in the energy transition, supporting clients with sustainable financing solutions and specialized advisory services tailored to today's challenges.

One of the leaders driving this momentum is Isidoro del Álamo, Head of Sustainability & Low Carbon Advisory at BBVA Corporate & Investment Banking. From his team, he leads the support provided to companies that are transforming their business models as part of a sustainable and resilient growth strategy. “Our role goes far beyond the financial. We help structure complex transactions, identify new business opportunities, and support companies in their strategic decision-making,” he explains.

This team was established in 2021 as a strategic initiative by BBVA to strengthen its specialized sustainability advisory capabilities, with a clear focus on energy transition and decarbonization. It is a global and sector-specific team designed to offer comprehensive guidance, from the early stages of strategy definition to the execution of specific projects.

Unlike other approaches that are more product-centric, the Sustainability & Low Carbon Advisory team is product-agnostic: it integrates the bank’s product capabilities—from capital structuring, whether equity or debt, to financing—and combines them with services that go beyond traditional banking. These include advisory on strategic partnerships, commercial agreements, off-balance-sheet structuring, regulatory support, and the development of new business areas for clients.

In addition, the team is composed of professionals with highly technical and specialized backgrounds, coming from strategic consulting firms, investment funds, investment banks, corporate finance firms, and the corporate sector. This cross-sector and technical expertise allows for a differentiated approach, offering solutions tailored to each industry and geography. The team is currently present in Madrid, London, Paris, Mexico, and the United States.

The team led by Del Álamo specializes in key technologies for the green transition, such as hydrogen and its derivatives (ammonia, synthetic fuels for aviation or maritime transport); biomethane; carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS); battery energy storage systems (BESS); geothermal energy; circular economy solutions—focused on recycling, packaging, and plastics; and natural capital, including biodiversity and water management, among others.

Clean technologies, green financing, and strategic collaboration

Del Álamo emphasizes that advancing clean technologies requires much more than financial resources. “It’s not just about offering capital, but about deeply understanding the sector, its cycles, and emerging technological opportunities,” he points out. That’s why BBVA goes beyond being a lender: it takes part in project structuring, advises on the formation of partnerships and commercial agreements, optimizes capital structures, facilitates access to different financing options, and designs solutions to manage transition-related risks.

""It’s not just about offering capital, but about deeply understanding the sector, its cycles, and emerging technological opportunities""

In recent years, the bank has been involved in pioneering projects related to green hydrogen, biomethane, and renewable energy, establishing itself as a strategic partner in the sector. BBVA has participated in the financing of the first carbon capture and storage projects in the United Kingdom—a key technology for achieving climate neutrality goals. More recently, it structured its first biomethane financing in Italy in partnership with Suma Capital, further solidifying its role as an expert partner in renewable energy beyond Spain.

A new horizon for sustainable finance

BBVA’s ambition is also reflected in its own commitments. The bank met its previous goal of channeling €300 billion in sustainable business between 2018 and 2025 a year ahead of schedule, in December 2024. Now, it has set a new target: to mobilize €700 billion between 2025 and 2029. “This goal reinforces our strategy of sustainability as a business opportunity and raises the ambition both in terms of volume and timeframe,” Del Álamo notes.

The timing is favorable: according to the International Energy Agency, the world must triple its renewable generation capacity this decade to meet the Paris Agreement goals. And Spain, with its natural resources and business landscape, could become one of Europe’s driving forces.

The future of energy Is already underway

For Isidoro del Álamo, the energy transition is a historic opportunity. “It’s not just an environmental challenge—it’s also a massive opportunity for industrial transformation, economic development, and job creation,” he says. His experience gives him a privileged view of what lies ahead: new technologies, new models of public-private collaboration, and a growing corporate awareness that places sustainability at the center.

Cases like the financing of sustainable assets in European markets—such as the recent biomethane project in Italy or carbon capture initiatives in the UK—demonstrate that the energy transition is a global effort, and BBVA has the expertise and specialization required to lead it.

With teams like the one led by Isidoro del Álamo, BBVA positions itself as a strategic partner for companies committed to a low-carbon future. Because the energy of tomorrow is being built today—and doing it right requires knowledge, ambition, and a long-term vision.",https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/midjourney_cleantech_apertura-op2-1024x575.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 04:01:06.830090

The large SUV, a centerpiece of Hyundai Motor Group’s collaboration with battery maker SK On, recorded 14,391 sales across domestic and international markets through July, the company said. The vehicle was first released in South Korea in February.

The performance stands out against the backdrop of what analysts have dubbed the “EV chasm,” a slowdown in consumer appetite that has forced many automakers to scale back production and delay investment plans. Hyundai sold 4,789 units in South Korea, 4,745 overseas, and 4,857 through its new Metaplant America factory in Georgia.

Exports began in April, and by July, sales abroad had already surpassed domestic deliveries. The model has proved especially popular in the United States, where 2,086 vehicles were sold in just three months despite a broader downturn in EV sales.

Hyundai splits production between its plant in Asan, south of Seoul, which builds export models, and its $7.6 billion Georgia complex, which supplies the American market.

The localized output allows SK On, Hyundai’s battery partner, to take advantage of federal tax credits tied to the Trump administration’s clean energy laws.

SK On operates two battery plants in Georgia and is building a third, a 35-gigawatt-hour joint venture facility with Hyundai.

Sitting idle - Some A$3 bln ($1.9 bln) of federal funding allocated to the state of Western Australia's energy transition has been sitting idle, with not a single dollar spent, the ABC reported. The cash from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's Rewiring the Nation fund was first allocated to WA in Aug. 2023, and it took the state government more than a year to recommend four projects to be considered for the funding. A WA government spokesperson told the broadcaster the proponents are now undertaking further feasibility work. Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation is looking to use the funding on its Chichester Corridor project in the state's remote north, and said it expects to receive a decision on the funding in late 2027, while APA Group said they are still having discussions with potential customers for its projects.

Signal - A failed referendum aimed at restarting a nuclear power plant will heighten the pressure on Taiwan’s leaders to explore solutions for the island’s increasing energy needs, Bloomberg reported. Only around 22% of eligible voters participated in the vote on Saturday, with a majority supporting the restart of the Maanshan nuclear plant, missing the 25% threshold. Some argued that the result, even in its defeat, is sending a signal to the government that more people believe nuclear-based energy solutions should be considered. Taiwan, a global production hub of semiconductors, could see energy consumption from the manufacture of AI chips continue to grow, potentially muting its climate progress, according to a recent report from Greenpeace.

Conclusion: A Call for Prudence The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads.","The U.S. offshore wind sector, once hailed as a cornerstone of the green energy transition, now finds itself entangled in a web of regulatory and geopolitical uncertainty. For investors, the interplay between policy shifts, executive overreach, and market dynamics has created a high-stakes environment where even the most ambitious projects face existential risks. Ørsted, the Danish energy giant, epitomizes this tension, as its U.S. ventures—such as the Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects—have been battered by abrupt regulatory reversals and financial cliffs. This article examines how policy instability is reshaping the investment calculus for offshore wind and what it means for the future of renewable energy stocks.

The Trump-Era Legacy: A Regulatory Vacuum

The roots of today's uncertainty lie in the Trump administration's (2017–2021) aggressive dismantling of renewable energy frameworks. Policies like the ""Unleashing American Energy"" executive order prioritized fossil fuels, halting offshore wind permits and leasing while accelerating oil and gas development. This created a vacuum of certainty, as developers like Ørsted were left to navigate a rapidly shifting regulatory landscape. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 further exacerbated the crisis by eliminating tax credits for wind and solar projects unless construction began within 12 months of enactment. This policy forced companies to fast-track projects or face financial ruin, a strategy that proved unsustainable for many.

Ørsted's Revolution Wind project, 80% complete in 2025, was abruptly halted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) under ""unspecified national security concerns."" Despite being fully permitted, the project now faces a $575 million impairment, a stark reminder of how executive discretion can override market fundamentals. Such stop-work orders, justified by vague national security claims, have become a tool to stifle offshore wind development, favoring entrenched fossil fuel interests.

Financial Volatility and Strategic Retreats

The financial toll of this instability is evident. Ørsted's U.S. offshore wind portfolio has already incurred $6.275 billion in impairments, with a $9.4 billion capital raise in 2025 to stave off collapse. These figures underscore the fragility of offshore wind's business model under U.S. policy conditions. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for offshore wind projects has risen by 3–4 percentage points since 2020, driven by higher interest rates and the shift to merchant (non-subsidized) project models. In the U.S., where regulatory uncertainty compounds these risks, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for offshore wind now ranges from $70/MWh to $157/MWh—far above the $30–$50/MWh range for onshore wind and solar.

The trade war with China has further inflamed costs, as tariffs on Chinese wind components (e.g., aluminum, steel) have inflated project budgets. For Ørsted, this has meant a strategic pivot to more stable markets. The UK, Germany, and South Korea now dominate its offshore wind pipeline, while emerging markets like Brazil and Vietnam offer lower political risk. This shift reflects a broader sector trend: international developers are increasingly hedging against U.S. policy volatility by diversifying geographically.

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For investors, the U.S. offshore wind sector presents a paradox. While the long-term demand for clean energy is undeniable, the short-term risks are acute. Here are three key considerations:

Diversify Across Jurisdictions: The U.S. market remains a high-risk, high-reward bet. Investors should balance exposure to U.S. offshore wind with onshore renewables in states like Texas and California, where state-level mandates and grid infrastructure provide greater stability.

Monitor Policy Cycles: U.S. energy policy is inherently cyclical, with presidential transitions often triggering abrupt regulatory shifts. Advocacy for state-level partnerships and grid modernization can mitigate federal-level risks.

Prioritize Resilient Markets: The UK, Germany, and South Korea offer more predictable regulatory environments. For Ørsted, these markets now account for over 60% of its offshore wind capacity, a strategic realignment that should be mirrored by investors.

Conclusion: A Call for Prudence

The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads. While its potential to decarbonize the grid is immense, the current policy environment—marked by regulatory arbitrariness and geopolitical tensions—demands a cautious approach. For Ørsted and its peers, the path forward lies in geographic diversification and strategic flexibility. Investors, in turn, must weigh the allure of U.S. market growth against the reality of policy-driven volatility. In this landscape, prudence—not optimism—will be the hallmark of successful capital allocation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-25 03:00:58.780554
,American Energy,2025-08-25 05:24:35+00:00,Informed Comment,"When even Saudi Arabia Jumps into Solar and Wind Power, You know Change is Here",Juan Cole,,,,,https://www.juancole.com/2025/08/saudi-arabia-change.html,"Some 38% of Saudi power plants use petroleum and 62% of electricity generation is done by domestically produced fossil gas.
In one recent year, Saudi Arabia lost $11 billion on electricity generation.
If Saudi Arabia switched to solar power for electricity plants, it would free up for export the oil and gas it now uses domestically.
well, Saudi Arabia of solar.
I perceive Saudi Arabia to have talked a good game about renewables for some years, while nothing was done on the ground.","Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – Saudi Arabia’s massive oil deposits and its 9.53 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum production make it an enormous carbon polluter and the foremost enemy of climate science and of electric vehicles.

Some 38% of Saudi power plants use petroleum and 62% of electricity generation is done by domestically produced fossil gas.

But here’s the paradox. Saudi electricity demand is currently growing 10% a year . The oil and gas supplied by the government to power plants is subsidized. If the kingdom sold the oil abroad instead at $67.76 a barrel (this weekend’s Brent crude price), it would make more billions for its Vision 2030 transition to a less hydrocarbon-based economy.

In one recent year, Saudi Arabia lost $11 billion on electricity generation.

If Saudi Arabia switched to solar power for electricity plants, it would free up for export the oil and gas it now uses domestically. Further, if it doesn’t switch, it can expect the country’s electricity demand to eat up more and more oil and gas every year, a gigantic opportunity cost, since it won’t make any money from exporting them and it will have to subsidize the locals, costing even more money.

So the smart play here is to go solar, right? I mean, Saudi Arabia is potentially the . . . well, Saudi Arabia of solar. And that is what the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which has nearly $1 trillion to play with, has decided.

Just last month, ACWA Power and a consortium inked $8.3 billion in green energy deals that will eventuate in seven solar and wind farms around the country. These power generation projects will add 15 gigawatts of further renewable capacity.

Just last week, ACWA made the announcement that three projects that will ultimately generate 2.7 gigawatts of electricity have actually already begun producing some electricity. The Saad 2 solar farm in the capital of Riyadh was certified for a further 365 megawatts, bringing its total capacity to a bit over 1.1 gigawatts, and it is at least partly online. Another, at Hail in the north-central part of the country, has thrown the switch and will produce 1.4 gigawatts all on its own when fully operational. In al-Qasim in the center of the kingdom, a solar plant is putting out 1 gigawatt of power, and will double its output when it is fully implemented.

Moreover, the prices are eye-popping. The solar plant at Hail is producing electricity for a little over 1.7 cents a kilowatt hour. The Saad 2 plant has a production cost of close to 1.8 cents a kilowatt hour. The energy produced at the solar farm at al-Qasim, presumably near the provincial capital of Burayda, has a cost of less than 1.7 cents a kilowatt hour.

In the GCC countries generally, fossil gas electricity generation costs 11 cents per kilowatt hour. So these solar farms are saving a ton of money.

I perceive Saudi Arabia to have talked a good game about renewables for some years, while nothing was done on the ground. Only about 1% of current power generation is wind and solar. But ACWA has carried out major renewables installations in Morocco, Egypt and the UAE. That some renewables generation has actually begun, and that further big deals have finally been signed suggest that this time the commitment is genuine.

Despite Riyadh’s propaganda campaign against the science of climate change (it helped destroy Twitter as a public platform for scientists by helping Elon Musk take it over), the Saudi elite knows very well that the earth is rapidly heating and that the global public is gradually turning against carbon pollution. Pilgrims to Mecca are increasingly at risk of deadly heat stroke. Since Saudi Arabia’s opulent prosperity almost entirely derives from its petroleum exports, they know that they have to find another way to make money.

So, they are diversifying. For some odd reason they’ve bought an interest in a lot of the video game companies, such as Scopely, Nintendo, Capcom, Tecmo and Koei Tecmo. I guess they think nerds will pay to play for decades to come.

The transition to a prosperous non-oil economy is going to be extremely expensive, especially since the kingdom can’t know when its oil may suddenly plummet in value. Economists suspect China has already reached peak oil this year, and that its petroleum imports will drop every year from here on in, since its transition to electric vehicles is proceeding so rapidly.

“Solar Kingdom,” Digital, Dall-E / Clip2Comic, 2025

China imports about 11 million barrels a day of petroleum. Global production is about 102 million barrels a day. If China starts importing only 10, and then 9, and then 8 mn bpd, that trend will put significant downward pressure on prices.

Year over year as of Q1 of 2025, the European Union importation of petroleum fell in value over 11% and in volume some 8%. This decrease probably has more to do with the EU attempt to wean itself off Russian oil because of the Ukraine War than with the rise of EVs. But EVs are part of the equation; in 2024, 1 in 7 new car sales in the European Union were electric. Over time, European consumption of petroleum will fall, as well.

So Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and his advisers weren’t born yesterday. They read these numbers for a living.

So if they can free up petroleum for export now while there is still high demand at relatively high prices, that is a positive for them. Which means switching to renewable power plants.

The Saudi elite is not taking this step for altruistic reasons. But that it makes sense economically and technologically for them to move in this direction at all is a huge bellwether for all of us.

Although Beijing has engineered drops in coal-fired power output and carbon emissions, new coal projects are at a decade high, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and Global Energy Monitor said in a report on Monday reviewing the first half of 2025.

That trend is likely to continue over the next two years unless the government takes action, according to the report. Earlier pledges to relegate the fossil fuel to a supporting role haven’t been properly implemented, even as coal’s share of power generation has fallen to a nine-year low of 51% and renewables have risen to 60% of total installed capacity.

“This rush of activity signals possible pressure from the industry to expand coal projects as a last ditch effort before China’s 2030 carbon peaking deadline,” the report said.

On the Wire

China’s economy is buckling under the weight of tariffs and a deep-rooted property crisis, yet stocks are extending their bull run — a disconnect that’s stirring doubts on the rally’s staying power.

China’s solar installations continued to slow in July, as developers waited for more details about a new policy that took effect in June and may affect renewables returns. Meanwhile, one of the giants of the industry, Longi Green Energy Technology Co., posted a narrower first-half loss as solar additions helped limit the impact of overcapacity.

Some US metal dealers are redirecting China-bound shipments of scrap copper through countries including Canada, Mexico and Vietnam in a risky move to avoid 10% import tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.

When Louisiana leads, America wins – and with Project Cypress, we can lead today while building a stronger, more competitive energy future for generations to come.","Louisiana has always powered America – from offshore rigs to refineries to the plants that fuel our nation’s economy. At Heirloom, we’re proud to help write the next chapter by bringing new technologies that capture and commoditize carbon dioxide to help position Louisiana to lead the next great energy revolution, securing jobs, lifting rural communities, and keeping Louisiana competitive for decades.

President Trump has called for a new “Golden Era of American Energy Dominance,” urging the nation to unlock its full potential through expanded production and accelerated innovation. Governor Landry is advancing that vision with policies that drive energy growth and industrial innovation across Louisiana, laying the foundation for projects that strengthen America’s energy and industrial security.

One of the most promising examples is our participation in Project Cypress in Northwest Louisiana. At the Port of Caddo-Bossier where we’re building one of the nation’s first large-scale Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities. Using our advanced technology, we will transform carbon dioxide into a high-value resource for fuels, materials, and manufacturing to strengthen Louisiana's new and existing industries, from AI to energy. With support from President Trump’s Department of Energy, Project Cypress will drive hundreds of millions in private investment and create high-wage jobs – exactly the kind of growth rural Louisiana parishes need to strengthen their tax base to fix schools and roads, and build stronger communities.

A New Engine of Growth for Northwest Louisiana

Project Cypress positions Louisiana to compete in a global industry worth more than $135 billion. This combined investment will spark a new wave of industry, turning captured carbon into opportunities that power advanced manufacturing, new fuels and stronger energy production that achieve the same prosperity that Louisianans have secured for generations.

Big players are already investing. We’re working with partners like United Airlines to advance next-generation aviation fuels. And tech companies driving the AI revolution are among our largest customers, using DAC to balance the energy intensity of data centers. These partnerships show that the world’s leading companies believe in what we are building here in Louisiana.

Smart federal policy set the stage – from granting Louisiana the authority to manage carbon storage to new incentives that drive private investment. Now it’s Louisiana’s turn to seize this opportunity, build the industries of the future, and create thousands of jobs.

Strong Leadership in Louisiana and Washington

This progress would not be possible without champions at every level.

With strong leadership from Governor Jeff Landry, support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, and bold vision for American energy competitiveness from President Trump, Louisiana has the champions it needs to ensure job-creators like us can succeed. Their leadership creates the conditions for innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness – and we’re proud to be part of that momentum.

Together, their leadership ensures Louisiana remains at the forefront of industrial growth, creating new industries and opportunities for generations to come.

A Model for National Security and Global Competitiveness

Project Cypress is strategically co-located with pipelines and industrial corridors to reduce costs and accelerate deployment – the same way Louisiana’s LNG boom was built. Once again, Louisiana is proving that energy dominance starts here, showing the nation how to lead an energy revolution from the ground up.

In a world where competitors are positioning against us, America cannot afford to fall behind. By embracing DAC as part of our energy mix; we’re strengthening national security – ensuring that the United States – not foreign adversaries – controls the technologies that will fuel industry and shape global energy production for decades to come.

We started Heirloom because we believe this is how America wins: by building the industries of the future around the strengths we already possess. Louisiana understands energy abundance, knows how to build resilient infrastructure, and has the skilled workforce to match. The same formula that made it a leader in oil, gas, and LNG will make it a leader in the next chapter of American energy.

Louisiana’s Next Chapter

Energy dominance is not a slogan. It’s a strategy – and it is being built right here in Louisiana. Project Cypress demonstrates how federal support and private innovation can create new industries, generate jobs, and keep America ahead of global competitors. While China and Europe are racing ahead with major investments, Heirloom is committed to ensuring that America leads this critical frontier.

Now is the time to double down. With strong leadership from Governor Landry, bold vision from President Trump, and Louisiana’s congressional delegation fighting for us, Project Cypress will become a global model for American innovation, industrial strength, and energy leadership.

We’re proud to be investing in Northwest Louisiana and partnering with local communities to build the industries of tomorrow.

(Reuters) -Oil prices edged higher on Monday after Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russia, fanning concerns Russian oil supply could be disrupted, while expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates buoyed the outlook for global growth and fuel demand.

Brent crude futures rose 3 cents, or 0.04%, to $67.76 at 0342 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 7 cents, or 0.11%, to $63.73.

Ukraine launched a drone attack on Russia on Sunday, which forced a sharp fall in the capacity of a reactor at one of Russia's biggest nuclear power plants and sparked a huge blaze at the Ust-Luga fuel export terminal, Russian officials said.

In addition, a fire at Russia's Novoshakhtinsk refinery, caused by a Ukrainian drone attack, was burning for the fourth day on Sunday, the acting governor of the region said.

The refinery sells fuel mainly for export and has an annual capacity of 5 million metric tons of oil, or around 100,000 barrels per day.

""Given the success that Ukraine is having with its targeting of Russian oil infrastructure ... the risks for crude oil are shifting to the topside,"" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.

Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Russia has made ""significant concessions"" toward a negotiated settlement in its war with Ukraine on Sunday.

""They've recognized that they're not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And, importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee for the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Vance said on NBC's ""Meet the Press with Kristen Welker"" program.

However, U.S. President Donald Trump also renewed threats on Friday that he would impose sanctions on Russia if there was no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks.

Investors' risk appetite has improved after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday signaled a possible interest rate cut at the U.S. central bank's meeting next month.

""A risk-on tone across markets boosted investor appetite across the commodities complex, aided by renewed supply side issues across energy and metals,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.

Dallas Innovates reported on the agreement between Fort Worth-based Paragon Energy Solutions and Oregon-based NuScale Power. NuScale holds the distinction of being the only SMR nuclear technology provider that has received design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Paragon, meanwhile, specializes in safety products like its CoreVision Neutron Monitoring System technology and Highly Integrated Protection System that will be incorporated into NuScale's SMR tech and forthcoming energy plants.

NuScale is bullish about its future. Company CEO John Hopkins pointed to the Trump administration's recent supportive steps as well as approval of a 77-megawatt module as reasons for optimism, according to UtilityDive. The company expects to have a few customers finalized by the end of 2025.

Paragon says CoreVision will grant NuScale ""reliable, accurate, and modernized monitoring and control of reactor power levels,"" per Dallas Innovates. The HIPS is tailored to SMRs and will safeguard instrumentation and control systems with reliable, cyber-secure protection.

Nuclear fission, while imperfect, holds several advantages over dirty energy. As Robert Hayes, an associate professor of nuclear engineering at North Carolina State University, detailed, it isn't completely safe, but its risk level pales in comparison to coal and other energy sources.

SMRs add energy flexibility to the nuclear fission mix, as they are smaller and more flexible. That provides an avenue for areas that don't have sites for large plants and adds efficiencies through a modular design.

The passive systems, low power and operating pressure, and decreased reliance on external power or human intervention increase safety margins and reduce the chances of unsafe radioactivity releases, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

They can also be paired with clean energy systems like wind and solar to kick in more prominently in times of lower power generation, per the IAEA. Still, there are concerns about their safety, as expressed by Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

That hasn't stopped a raft of projects in Canada, at universities in the U.S., and from aspiring companies.

The project’s payback period could be realized in barely over two years, the companies say. Tri Quantity Sdn Bhd served as energy consultant to DKSH on the project and reported on the early results.

“This initiative not only strengthens our operational efficiency but also reaffirms DKSH’s commitment to sustainable, future-focused business practices,” Joel Solomon, head of supply chain management, DKSH Malaysia & Brunei, said.

The DKSH warehouse covers about 56,100 square meters with an air-conditioning range of more than 41,000 square meters, according to the case study on the project by Tri Quanity Sdn Bhd. The typical annual electricity consumption of the entire warehouse averaged about 5.65 million kWh per year.

HTMS altered the chilling water loop system by fitting all the pumps with new silicon carbide seals while deploying the Maxwell Sub-Micron coolant. The Maxwell fluid was then injected into the pump discharge side of the HVAC system.

The targeted concentration of Maxwell fluid was achieved at 2% of liquid volume in the system. The injection also increased the system fluid density by 6%.

HTMS says the Maxwell fluid is non-toxic and recyclable.

Energy efficiency is often termed as the “first fuel” in reduction of both consumption, costs and greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has estimated that HVAC systems account for approximately 40% of total energy consumption in commercial buildings and perhaps a third of usage in industrial facilities.

Construction began on Revolution Wind in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted.
It’s one of five offshore wind projects under construction in U.S. waters.
The country currently has only one fully operational utility-scale offshore wind project, South Fork, near Long Island, New York.
In August 2023, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers co-signed the authorization of plans for Ørsted to build 65 wind turbines for the Revolution Wind project.","It happened again. For the second time this year, the Trump administration has halted the construction of a massive offshore wind farm being built to power blue states.

On Friday, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all construction on the nearly complete Revolution Wind offshore project so the federal government can ​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona, a former lobbyist for offshore oil and gas companies, did not specify the nature of those concerns.

The move echoes an April order from the Interior Department that stopped all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project.

Last time, the controversial pause lasted just one month but cost the developer nearly $1 billion — and drove the project to the brink of cancellation. This time, with a Trump appointee now at the helm of BOEM, it’s unclear how long this costly work stoppage might last.

Construction began on Revolution Wind in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted. The wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a federally designated ​“wind energy area” that was created after a five-year-long consultation between the state of Massachusetts, coastal towns, federal agencies, and branches of the military including the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and Army Corps of Engineers.

Once the 704-megawatt project is complete, its cables will come ashore in Rhode Island and its carbon-free electricity will be fed into New England’s regional grid and serve utility customers who saw their power bills skyrocket this past winter. It’s one of five offshore wind projects under construction in U.S. waters. The country currently has only one fully operational utility-scale offshore wind project, South Fork, near Long Island, New York.

President Donald Trump promised that America would see ​“no new windmills” on his watch. Friday’s order is just the latest attempt to make good on that pledge: In recent months the Trump administration has killed offshore wind leasing, paused permitting, and sunsetted tax credits critical to the economic viability of offshore wind farms.

The purpose given for Friday’s stop-work order — ​“national security interests” — has long-time wind industry insiders scratching their heads.

“There were no major military issues that came to the fore in New England,” said wind energy veteran Bill White in an interview with Canary Media. From 2009 to 2015, White represented Massachusetts on a BOEM-led intergovernmental task force focused on the responsible siting of offshore wind energy areas south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket islands.

“Was the military at the table, represented and consulted with during this stakeholder process? The answer is: very much so,” said White, who for much of his time on the task force worked for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center as senior director of offshore wind sector development.

White — who went on to oversee offshore wind as a CEO of Avangrid Renewables, one of the developers of Massachusetts’ embattled Vineyard Wind project — said he’s aware of national security issues that have been raised about proposed offshore wind projects near Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, which have coastlines dotted with large military installations.

In April 2023, for example, the Pentagon flagged proposed wind energy areas in the central Atlantic Coast as ​“highly problematic.” But the Pentagon has not raised those kinds of high-level concerns over Revolution Wind — or any of the projects being built in New England’s waters, according to White. The Pentagon did not return a request for comment.

Development of the Revolution Wind project began more than a decade ago. In 2013, Deepwater Wind New England LLC won a federal auction for two leases in the wind energy area designated by the intergovernmental task force; Ørsted later acquired those leases when it bought the company. From 2016 to 2020, the Danish firm assessed the site and continued to engage stakeholders, like local fishermen, according to BOEM records.

Between 2020 and 2023, Revolution Wind endured an extensive regulatory review, including from the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration. Since wind turbines have the potential to affect air-traffic radar and aviation navigation, the FAA conducted an airspace analysis. The agency ultimately approved the project under the condition that all turbines be built to lighting and marking standards that would ensure they’re visible to aircraft at night.

In August 2023, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers co-signed the authorization of plans for Ørsted to build 65 wind turbines for the Revolution Wind project. The National Marine Fisheries Service, a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also signed the authorization.

During Revolution Wind’s long road to construction, it had strong support from neighboring states, which have made ambitious renewable energy commitments in recent years.

“The Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability,” said Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, a Democrat, in a statement.

In a post to X, McKee said that he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, ​“will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind.” Lamont, in an Instagram post, called the order a ​“political move.”

This new fight between the two governors and the feds could play out similarly to the fight between New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Trump administration over the Empire Wind project earlier this year. After weeks of developer Equinor threatening to walk away from the halted project due to the high costs of delayed construction, the Trump administration reversed course and lifted the ban, claiming it had struck a deal with Hochul, a Democrat, to allow a natural gas pipeline to be built in the state.

On the day the Interior Department lifted the order, Secretary Doug Burgum thanked Hochul in a social media post for her ​“willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” But a representative for Hochul’s office told Canary Media at the time that ​“no deal on any natural gas pipeline was reached.”

The Trump administration, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, has in recent months pushed for New England and in particular Massachusetts to build new gas pipelines.

McKee and Lamont — or perhaps Ørsted — could also opt for litigation, a route not taken by Hochul or Equinor during the Empire Wind drama.

The Trump administration’s stop-work order comes as Ørsted is seeking to raise billions of dollars from its shareholders to help complete Revolution Wind and its other fully permitted U.S. project, Sunrise Wind, after other financing options fell through.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Revolution-Wind-1st-turbine-September-2024.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=71b5b10ba7f6d4374c188ebad4c03d22,N,,2025-08-24 22:59:51.247741

Working hand-in-hand with industry and Māori communities and strengthening our technical capability will be critical to fulfilling New Zealand’s geothermal potential.","How much of New Zealand’s electricity would you think is generated by geothermal power? Would it surprise you to hear at least 20%? Last year New Zealand’s government announced a $60m investment to explore furthering New Zealand’s geothermal potential and unlock new areas for industrial growth, tourism and trade.

The investment announcement was recently followed by the issuing of ‘From the Ground Up – a draft strategy to unlock New Zealand’s geothermal potential’, New Zealand’s first ever national Geothermal Strategy. The draft strategy seeks to develop a pathway for New Zealand to extend its international leadership in geothermal innovation, accelerate domestic energy resilience, and strengthen regional economic growth associated with geothermal development. Industry practitioners, researchers, iwi, energy companies and the public have until 12 September to submit feedback on the draft.

The Government is proposing to double geothermal energy use by 2040. Key to this will be the successful implementation of supercritical geothermal - a type of geothermal energy that utilises extremely hot and pressurised water found deep within the Earth's crust. If it can be harnessed, supercritical geothermal offers a cleaner energy source than fossil fuels, with potentially lower emissions. It also poses challenges around the depth of drilling and accessing of data to make informed decisions.

Dr John O’Sullivan says “This is where innovation is required. Geothermal energy was met with scepticism and uncertainty back in the 1950s and New Zealand still forged ahead and created pioneering work that has had a lasting impact. Now it's time to scale.”

O’Sullivan is a senior lecturer in engineering and co-director of the Geothermal Institute. Since 1978, the Geothermal Institute at the University of Auckland has produced more than 2,000 graduates who have lent their expertise to industry across the globe, as well as here at home. Many have worked on research and development at the Wairakei geothermal field. Graduates are also compelling ambassadors for New Zealand’s geothermal capability and ingenuity in this sector internationally.

“Industry is poised, talent is coming through, and the technology is moving fast, with advancements in areas such as remote sensing, big data and advanced digital tools to accurately model sub-surface geothermal resources. Working hand-in-hand with industry and Māori communities and strengthening our technical capability will be critical to fulfilling New Zealand’s geothermal potential. Our universities, public research organisations like Earth Sciences New Zealand, vocational training providers and industry innovators all have a part to play – collaboration will be the key to future success.”

Within the draft geothermal strategy, the government has highlighted the importance of education and promoting and developing career pathways in geothermal.

Mike Roger is the Strategic Growth Manager for Energy and Climate Innovations at UniServices, the University’s commercialisation and research translation company. He helps communities, industry and government build partnerships with our researchers in the energy space to find new pathways to create impact.

Roger says “Industry regularly brings us big problems that need solving, and the Geothermal Institute has been great at stepping up to meet those challenges. They’re very commercially minded, and the applied nature of their research and underlying expertise lends itself extremely well to developing creative solutions. To leverage future potential, it’s important to have support for initial infrastructure development though, to lower the barrier to entry. It’s very expensive to drill wells.”

The global geothermal landscape is changing rapidly, with the United States as well as countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and East Africa increasing investment in exploration of options for clean energy to support sustainability and spur economic growth. Another motivating factor is energy security, with interest in reducing reliance on fossil fuels or precarious energy imports.

To meet this rising demand for electricity, energy production will need to expand dramatically and quickly.
What's being done about renewable energy?","The Texas economy could be one of the biggest losers from the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" that became law earlier this year, according to Bloomberg.

As the state's electricity needs surge, the bill's cuts to renewable energy incentives are projected to cause higher energy prices and potential electricity shortfalls, per Bloomberg. The result is expected to be slower economic growth.

""We will severely restrict economic growth,"" said Doug Lewin, an expert on Texas energy, per Bloomberg. ""Because we can't grow without energy.""

What's happening?

Under the new law, wind and solar energy projects across the U.S. will only qualify for tax incentives if construction begins by July 4, 2026, or are placed in operation by the end of 2027, according to E&E News.

Previously, these programs were slated to last until December 31, 2032, according to the EPA.

This change is projected to have an enormous impact on the future of energy production in Texas, which presently relies on renewable sources for 30% of its electricity, per Bloomberg.

BloombergNEF has predicted that the number of wind, solar, and battery-storage facilities brought online annually in 2035 will be 23% lower as a result of the new law. It is possible the new law will help to spur along some projects faster, at least, but there is not yet any data to support that notion.

With peak energy demand in Texas expected to nearly double from 85.5 gigawatts in 2023 to 150 gigawatts by 2030, per Bloomberg, Texas needs all of the power it can get.

""We're in an energy crunch,"" Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert at the University of Texas Austin said, per Bloomberg. ""We should be doubling down on everything we can build right now. Making things more expensive is antithetical to that.""

From 2020 to 2024, the Texas economy outperformed the U.S. as a whole, increasing its GDP by 51% versus 37% nationwide, according to Bloomberg. Much of this growth has been fueled by cheap electricity costs.

If new sources of electricity cannot be brought online fast enough to meet this growing demand, prices will increase, and Texas will lose its energy advantage.

Why does renewable energy production in Texas matter?

Expanding renewable-energy production is essential to meeting the nation's rising electricity needs, which are projected to grow significantly in coming years as massive new data centers consume large quantities of electricity.

Dirtier, non-renewable sources of energy simply cannot be brought online fast enough to meet this demand. Presently, there is a five-year waitlist for the turbines used in natural-gas-powered plants, according to Bloomberg.

By comparison, a massive new solar-and-battery facility in California was brought online just two years after shovels hit the ground, a remarkable turnaround time for a project of that scale and complexity.

Even in oil-and-gas-friendly Texas, non-renewables have made up just 6% of new energy capacity since 2020, with the remaining 94% coming from new solar, wind, and battery-storage facilities, per Bloomberg.

Some companies operating data centers have explored small modular nuclear reactors, with one company specializing in it, Oklo, formerly chaired by OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman — though nuclear projects also take years to get going and bring non-trivial safety risks, even if their energy generation comes without directly contributing to greenhouse gas pollution.

The situation in Texas is representative of the rest of the country. Data centers, which are used to run power-hungry AI models, consumed 4.4% of all U.S. electricity produced in 2023. That figure is projected to reach 6.7% to 12% by 2028, according to the Department of Energy.

To meet this rising demand for electricity, energy production will need to expand dramatically and quickly. If the increase in demand outpaces the available supply, electricity prices will go up for everyone.

What's being done about renewable energy?

Meeting growing energy demands will require an all-of-the-above approach to electricity production with an emphasis on the projects that can be brought online the most quickly. Relying on dirtier, nonrenewable sources of energy alone will be insufficient to the task.

While the challenge is massive, there are actions that individuals can take to make a difference. For example, by using your voice, contacting your elected representatives, and voting for political candidates who share your policy priorities, you can help to push for a return of the renewable-energy incentives necessary to meet rising energy needs.

Further, by installing solar panels on your home, you can reduce reliance on overtaxed energy grids while also ensuring that your home is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

By pairing solar with a home-battery system, you can make your house more resilient in the event of a power outage while also potentially supplying power back to the grid when it is needed most, reducing the need for additional large-scale power plants.

“That means correctly placing aviation’s efforts within the context of the global energy transition.
Refineries produce a slew of products so when we talk about SAF production, it is important to remember this is a small share of refined output.
Coordinated strategies are essential for decarbonization because aviation is just one part of the broader energy transition.","Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP of Sustainability and Chief Economist, says the timing means the WSS can substantially influence the agenda for decarbonization. “The WSS is a forum for new ideas and fresh collaboration,” she says. “Thinkers, doers, and regulators will come together and decide how to make progress toward net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and broader sustainability targets.”

The energy transition

The location of the WSS—Hong Kong ( 21-22 October)—is equally significant as Asia-Pacific is aviation’s fastest-growing market and notable for its SAF production opportunities. India, Malaysia, and Vietnam are just a selection of countries in the region that could play crucial roles in SAF production.

China, meanwhile, has a strong record in strategic planning and is invariably successful in implementing those plans, often before deadline. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2060 with peak emissions occurring before 2030.

A SAF pilot project in China has been extended. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)'s 14th Five-Year Plan calls for over 20,000 tons of SAF consumption in 2025 and a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Research Centre to develop standards and a certification system has been established. It is reported that more than 3 million tonnes of SAF production is either planned or in construction.

China’s ability to be a trend-setter in SAF is important as SAF will do the heavy lifting if aviation is to reach net-zero by 2050. But Thomsen emphasizes that decarbonization is not just an industry issue.

“The WSS will highlight radical collaboration,” she says. “That means correctly placing aviation’s efforts within the context of the global energy transition. This is a huge economic development opportunity, which will build new markets and industries and create jobs.”

Thomsen suggests that if individual industries try to find their own solution each one will fail. “But together it is possible to succeed,” she adds. “Aside from the economic implications, countries that are forward-looking in this area can achieve greater energy independence. Refineries produce a slew of products so when we talk about SAF production, it is important to remember this is a small share of refined output. The majority of renewable refined products will benefit other industries. This means that helping airlines obtain sustainable aviation fuel will give most other industries greater access to renewable fuels.”

Attracting investment

Investment is needed to fund new SAF production facilities and other sustainability initiatives. Certainly, money is available if investors think the returns will be there. The amount of finance available to artificial intelligence development speaks to the deep pockets that investors have if they believe in a project.

But the truth is that oil is bringing in about a 20% return while renewable energy is lagging at 5%. Bridging that gap requires the right policies and incentives from regulators.

The good news is that solar and wind power have already shown the way forward. SAF needs a similar level of investment to these now-established energy markets so regulators should be aware of the constituents of a good policy.

“The blueprint for success is there,” says Thomsen. “And it all fits together because this leads back to the idea of radical collaboration. This is not about giving money to aviation, it is about investing in the energy transition. SAF is just one part of the biofuel complex that will drive advances in renewable power.”

CORSIA

Other elements of the journey to net-zero carbon emissions will be under the spotlight at the WSS, from new technologies to green financing.

One key discussion point will be the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Mandatory reporting starts in 2027 but to date Guyana is the only country offering eligible emission units (EEU) for airlines to purchase.

Airlines are required to buy EEUs to meet the established baseline, but there is no requirement for countries to provide them. States need to authorize the release of credits for the use of airlines in the form of EEUs and ensure that these units are withdrawn from the Paris Agreement platform to avoid double counting.

But Thomsen notes that some countries lack the necessary resources or expertise to navigate the process. “IATA is doing its best to facilitate the process through workshops, and guidelines, and more hands-on assistance,” she says. “But we need to accelerate and increase the pipeline. We need to work out what projects are the closest to obtaining authorization and make that happen.”

IATA has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) which operates the SAF Registry and IATA has itself launched the SAF Matchmaker. It is additionally offering EEUs for airlines to purchase on its Aviation Carbon Exchange platform.

“We can’t afford CORSIA, agreed to by all UN member States, to fall apart and have each State adopt its own individual system, because such fragmentation is incompatible with global international civil aviation,” says Thomsen. “CORSIA must be strong to ensure a cohesive policy framework. And it will most likely raise more money for participating countries than any air travel ticket tax they might be contemplating.”

Thomsen concludes that the WSS will highlight two essential features for net-zero success—a global, liquid, and transparent SAF market, and a global, liquid, and transparent carbon credit market. Regulators can make this a viable proposition, just as they can promote the other technologies and levers required to reach net zero air transportation in 2050.

“It is time to break the silos and work across disciplines, ministries, institutions, and industries,” she says. “Anything else won’t work. Coordinated strategies are essential for decarbonization because aviation is just one part of the broader energy transition. Reaching net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 in any industry depends on effective policies and investment.”

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Throughout the summer, NPR's Short Wave podcast has been bringing us the latest science from the depths of the ocean. And today, we travel to the sea floor, home to rare earth elements like cobalt, nickel and copper. These elements are used in everything from smartphones to electric cars to fighter jets.

WALTER SOGNNES: There is a reason why all countries and all nations - they have a critical minerals strategy. It's because the foundation for a green transition is all these different minerals.

RASCOE: That's Walter Sognnes, CEO of Glomar Minerals, a mining company based in the U.K. Companies like his and some countries, including the U.S., want to commercially mine the deep sea. But scientists are warning about the environmental impact. NPR's Emily Kwong has more.

EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: You may be wondering, why are there rare earth elements in the deep sea?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PART OF YOUR WORLD"")

JODI BENSON: (As Ariel, singing) Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?

KWONG: It's not because a little mermaid is down there hoarding treasure. Rather, rare earth elements accumulate over millions of years in these potato-sized lumps called polymetallic nodules found on the sea floor. Matthias Haeckel, a marine geochemist at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany, says these nodules are found in certain parts of the ocean and act as anchor points for all kinds of marine life.

MATTHIAS HAECKEL: I think the oldest nodule in the Pacific that has been dated was 14 million years old.

KWONG: In fact, the nodules grow at an average rate of tens of millimeters per million years through two main pathways - adsorption, which begins when a particle, like a fish bone or a shark tooth, falls to the ocean floor. And eventually, metals from the water column accumulate around that shark tooth, coating it with layers of metal. And the second way is diffusion. That's driven by microbes breaking down organic material.

Now, a lot of green technology is actually moving away from cobalt- and nickel-based batteries towards sodium-ion batteries or batteries made from renewable or recyclable material. But Sognnes maintains that the thirst for electric vehicles, wind turbines, weapons means that rare earth elements will have to come from somewhere and that the nodules in the ocean are a more reasonable place to get them.

SOGNNES: We believe that disturbance we are making in the ocean is a lesser effect than the mining in the rainforest, for instance.

KWONG: But what is the long-term damage to the ocean if these nodules are pulled up? Scientists have tried to predict that through experiments. One of the most significant is the European JPI Oceans project MiningImpact. A team led by Haeckel went to two places rich with nodules, the Clarion-Clipperton zone and the Peru Basin, where scientists in the '80s and '90s purposefully disturbed the sediment.

HAECKEL: To look how these experiment areas have evolved.

KWONG: Decades later, the sediment showed very little recovery.

HAECKEL: And the reason for that is that the energy flow into the deep sea is very low.

KWONG: Because less than 1% of marine snow or organic material falls into the deep sea, everything down there grows very, very slowly. So if mining were to ever happen and those nodules were removed, Haeckel says they would not come back any time soon.

HAECKEL: The specific fauna that needs these nodules for their life is gone permanently on our human timescales.

KWONG: These environments are fragile, and it's one of the reasons that 38 countries have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until scientists figure out the safest way to do it.

Debuting at RE+, Bila's new 550W module series offers an innovative U.S.-made steel module frame that is a significantly stronger alternative to aluminum-framed panels

INDIANAPOLIS - August 25, 2025 - Bila Solar, a U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer, today announced a strategic partnership with Origami Solar, the industry leader in steel solar module frames.

Bila Solar will offer Origami Solar's U.S.-made steel frames as an option for its 550W dual-glass module series, which also incorporates a U.S.-manufactured solar cell. This combination gives customers higher domestic content, stronger eligibility for tax incentives and greater supply chain security.

Bila's new U.S.-made, steel-framed modules are designed to help developers weather market volatility by mitigating the impact of shifting tariffs and unpredictable price swings. In the wake of rising import prices, up 0.4% in July alone, and the rapid reshuffling of global solar supply chains, these new modules deliver the financial stability projects need, making them more attractive to investors and lenders. By incorporating U.S.-made steel frames and solar cells, the product also boosts domestic content, helping developers more easily qualify for the 10% domestic content bonus adder.

The new steel-framed 550W module series will be showcased at the upcoming RE+ trade show in Las Vegas from September 9-12. Attendees can view the module in the Bila Solar booth in the Caesars Forum — F16045 (by appointment only) and the Origami Solar booth Venetian Level 2 — V14131.

Origami Solar has reimagined the value that a solar frame can provide to module manufacturers, developers and solar asset owners. Bila's steel-framed modules provide customers with industry-leading module strength, innovative and proven corrosion-resistant coatings, and a dramatically lower carbon footprint.

""This partnership unites the future of renewable energy with America's core manufacturing industry, furthering the goal of onshoring the U.S. solar supply chain and solving a real-world problem for customers,"" said Mick McDaniel, Vice President and General Manager of Bila Solar. ""Our mission has always been to build a resilient domestic solar ecosystem. By integrating Origami's innovative and remarkably stronger steel frames and pairing them with U.S.-manufactured solar cells, we not only offer a stronger, more reliable module but also provide customers with increased domestic content to facilitate access to the 10% domestic content bonus adder.""

The agreement also leverages the increasing cost-competitiveness of domestic steel against tariff-impacted imported aluminum, making this an economically and logistically sound decision.

The Model S now has a base price of $94,990, while the Model X's base price is $99,990.
Earlier this year, a Tesla official said the company would make upgrades to the Model S and Model X.
Kelley Blue Book data shows that, in the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold 1,435 Model S and 2,871 Model Xs.
""With the latest price change, the two models' fate seems sealed, with dwindling sales and lackluster hardware updates,"" InsideEVs speculated.","Tesla has quietly raised the prices for two of its oldest models, in a move some critics are describing as a ""last hurrah"" for the vehicles.

What's happening?

In mid-August, prices for Tesla's Model S and Model X both increased by $10,000, InsideEVs reports.

The price increase does come with several additional features, which Tesla refers to as the ""Luxe Package."" That package, which is now a mandatory feature on the two models, includes Tesla's autonomous driving package, known as Full Self-Driving, free Supercharging, and a four-year service plan, among other features.

Previously, FSD alone was priced at $8,000 for each model, but it was available as an optional add-on, not a mandatory feature. And even when using FSD, drivers must still control the car and remain focused on the road at all times.

This is the second price hike this year on both models, following a $5,000 increase in June. The Model S now has a base price of $94,990, while the Model X's base price is $99,990.

Earlier this year, a Tesla official said the company would make upgrades to the Model S and Model X.

Why are these increases important?

The price hikes come at a time when Tesla has seen sales dwindle, especially for these two models.

Kelley Blue Book data shows that, in the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold 1,435 Model S and 2,871 Model Xs. For both models, that was a drop of at least 56% from the previous year. Overall, Tesla sales fell by 12.6% year-over-year.

Adding features to the Model S and Model X may make those cars more appealing to some would-be buyers, but the higher price tag is also likely to push some away. And some believe it could mark the end of these longtime Tesla stalwarts.

""With the latest price change, the two models' fate seems sealed, with dwindling sales and lackluster hardware updates,"" InsideEVs speculated.

What can I do about this?

Tesla remains the biggest all-electric vehicle company, so it's fair to worry that any dip in its sales, or any price increases, could lead to fewer EVs on the road. And the fewer EVs there are, the more pollution is created by gas-powered cars that rely on dirty fuel.

Fortunately, EV sales are at an all-time high. And with federal tax credits for EVs ending this fall, now could be the perfect time to make the switch to an EV, drive a car that's considerably better for the environment, and potentially save thousands of dollars.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tesla-Model-Simage-recMqW1GGC9IUwJL2-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 22:00:18.097360

Hydrogen is widely recognized as a clean energy source, and research suggests it may contribute to areas such as cell therapy and other medical applications.","The traditional Japanese spirit of monozukuri is defined by a deep commitment to craftsmanship, precision, and continuous improvement throughout every stage of the manufacturing process. How does your company embody the principles of monozukuri?

My father founded the company 67 years ago as a small manufacturer of manual LPG pumps, and we’ve been in the LP gas vaporizer business for about 60 years now. In the early days, we also offered plant engineering services, and through those operations, we came to realize the need for a vaporizer.

Over time, we developed a variety of products to meet our customers’ needs, including burners and LPG vaporizers. We’ve produced many types of vaporizers—some powered by electricity, others by hot water or steam. As we worked through these developments, we went through a process of trial and error. That journey allowed us to build valuable knowledge and expertise, which now informs every aspect of our manufacturing, design, and quality control. This is the foundation of our strength and our ongoing commitment to monozukuri.

Your products serve a wide range of industries and applications, including gas conversion, cooling, and fertilizers. Could you tell us more about your main customer segments and how your products are used in these areas? What do you think makes customers choose your company over others?

First, I want to emphasize that we don’t typically sell our products directly to end users in Japan. Most of our sales are through gas companies, construction firms, and distributors. These partners have their own product lines and work directly with the end users.

As for applications, our products are commonly used in facilities that consume gas, such as factories, hotels, restaurants, and hospitals. Among these, factories represent the largest share. For example, we supply vaporizers to steel and glass factories that operate large boilers. We also serve many automobile factories, which rely heavily on gas in their operations.

Your company has carved out a niche in the industry by offering customization and flexibility, rather than providing a one-size-fits-all solution. Could you tell us more about how you approach customization and how it applies across different industries or customer needs?

We offer both standard and customized products. For our standard items, we maintain a production schedule and keep a certain level of inventory so we can respond quickly and deliver with short lead times.

For customized products, the process typically begins when we receive an inquiry from a customer. We then pass that request to our technical team to assess whether the specifications are feasible. If they determine it is, they work with the sales team to prepare a quotation for the customer.

Once the customer places an order, we issue instructions to the factory to begin production. As you might expect, this process takes time—usually around two to three months.

We handle a large number of custom orders, and often these are based on designs we’ve developed previously. In such cases, we refer to our data archives and adapt or refine those earlier designs, rather than starting from scratch. This allows us to be more efficient and responsive. I believe this is something that sets us apart. Many other companies avoid this kind of niche customization, either because it’s too specialized or because the market is too small for a larger firm to focus on. For us, though, it’s a meaningful and growing segment, and one where we’ve built a strong reputation.

Many countries, particularly across Asia and other emerging markets, are working to phase out coal and oil. In this transition, LPG and LNG are increasingly being adopted as cleaner, more flexible alternatives. These fuels are also seen as enabling modular and decentralized energy systems that can enhance disaster resilience and energy security. How do you see the role of LPG and LNG systems in supporting the global shift toward a more flexible and sustainable energy infrastructure?

As you mentioned, there is a global shift toward cleaner energy, but many developed countries still rely heavily on coal and other high-emission fuels. This dependence contributes to issues like deforestation and air pollution, which in turn can lead to serious health problems. Compared to those energy sources, LPG and LNG are significantly more environmentally friendly. That’s why they are increasingly valued as alternative fuels.

One of the key advantages of LPG is its versatility. While it’s typically stored in large tanks, it can also be distributed in smaller, portable containers. This makes it especially useful for remote areas where access to other energy sources may be limited.

One of your notable developments is the DX system—a line of dry electric vaporizers designed specifically for overseas markets, offering solutions for space constraints and cost efficiency. Could you share some of the technical considerations that shaped the design of these products with international markets in mind?

A key feature of the DX product is that it operates without using any water. This is one of its defining characteristics, especially when compared to other vaporizers that rely on hot water for operation.

I was directly involved in the development of the DX product, and one of the biggest challenges we faced was related to temperature control. With hot water systems, the temperature rises and falls gradually. But with aluminum, the temperature can increase or decrease much more rapidly. That difference created a number of technical hurdles.

For instance, when the temperature rises too high, the system is designed to shut off automatically through a safety switch. During development, we experienced some malfunctions with that switch, which was something we had to address very carefully. Inside the aluminum structure, we installed temperature sensors, but the biggest issue we encountered was how to position the coil component, which is embedded in the center. If the coil is not aligned precisely, it can lead to malfunctions. Achieving perfect alignment during production was extremely difficult.

We went through a lot of trial and error, but eventually we found a solution. Today, we’re proud to say that we sell a large number of these vaporizers around the world, and they’ve become especially popular in Africa.

What do you believe are the key factors behind the success of this product in overseas markets, and particularly in Africa?

We originally developed this type of vaporizer in response to a specific customer request. The customer wanted a unit that didn’t require water because they planned to use it in street food carts in Singapore. Their intention was to mount the device on a wall or shelf rather than placing it on the ground. In that setup, it would be difficult to refill water regularly, which is why they needed a water-free solution.

Additionally, because space is so limited in Singapore, there are strict regulations for street food carts. A traditional vaporizer simply wouldn’t fit. That’s why we designed a more compact unit that could be installed in elevated spaces.

While many of our overseas customers may not face the exact same restrictions, I think the features that made the product suitable for that original use case—compact size, no water requirement, and flexible installation—are widely appreciated in other markets as well.

Turning to your overseas strategy, we understand you have two subsidiaries in Shanghai as well as a global distribution network. Could you tell us which markets or regions you are currently focusing on for further growth?

Right now, our priority markets are the Philippines in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, as these two regions account for the majority of our overseas revenue. In addition to that, we’re collaborating with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to install one of our units in Tanzania as a trial or proof of concept. Most households in Tanzania still rely on wood for cooking, and President Samia Suluhu Hassan has introduced a green cooking policy aimed at shifting from wood to cleaner energy sources such as LPG.

With that in mind, we applied to JICA’s program, which supports small and medium-sized enterprises like ours that may not have the resources to expand overseas independently, particularly in markets like Africa. JICA provides financial and logistical support to help companies like us develop opportunities in emerging regions.

For this project, we proposed our unique BAiO product, which is a tank with a built-in vaporizer. Typically, the tank, vaporizer, and related components are separate, but this unit integrates everything into one system. It can be installed easily by simply connecting a pipe, and it is also much easier to maintain. This kind of compact, all-in-one solution is particularly valuable in developing countries where safety standards and regulatory frameworks may not be as strict. The BAiO system offers both simplicity and enhanced safety, which we see as a strong advantage in these markets.

In addition to your collaboration with JICA, you also maintain a global distribution network. As you continue expanding internationally, are you actively seeking new partnerships? If so, what types of partners are you looking for?

When we enter new markets with partners, it’s essential that those partners have a strong understanding of the local market. They must also place a high priority on quality, and most importantly, they need to be reliable and trustworthy.

One of our key criteria is a potential partner’s technical and sales capability. They need to fully understand our products and have strong technical expertise, along with a well-developed sales network. It’s also crucial that they are knowledgeable about local regulations and have a solid track record of compliance. Any required certifications must be in place, and their organizational structure should be responsive and efficient.

Another important factor is the mindset and behavior of the partner. To build a long-term relationship, they must demonstrate a clear willingness to provide maintenance and after-sales service. That kind of customer support is critical to us. Corporate values are equally important. As a Japanese company, we put a strict emphasis on quality, and we need our partners to understand and share that philosophy. Before moving forward with any new partnership, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to ensure we can grow the market together effectively.

One interesting area of diversification is your Doctors Man product line, which focuses on hydrogen-based healthcare solutions. What was the strategic thinking behind entering this new market, and how do you see it complementing your core business?

We occasionally use hydrogen in our core business, but we also see significant potential in the healthcare sector. Hydrogen is widely recognized as a clean energy source, and research suggests it may contribute to areas such as cell therapy and other medical applications. With ongoing advancements in hydrogen-related research, we believe there is strong potential for commercialization in the healthcare field as well.

As a company, we are working to diversify our business portfolio, and this new venture is being led by our overseas sales and development team. We launched the Doctors Man project about six years ago, and it has become a pioneering company in the field of hydrogen-based healthcare products.

We serve as the exclusive distributor for Doctors Man, leveraging our technical expertise, industry knowledge, and international distribution network. Currently, we are offering hydrogen water generators and hydrogen gas inhalers as part of the product lineup.

So the product wasn’t originally developed in-house. Is this part of a development partnership, or are you strictly acting as a distributor?

We are solely the overseas distributor. They already have a strong domestic sales network in Japan, but since they are a small company like us, they don’t have an overseas presence. That’s why we approached them with the idea of working together. It turned out to be a good match.

Your company was founded in 1958, which means you’ll celebrate your 75th anniversary in 2033. Looking ahead, where do you envision the company by that milestone?

I haven’t looked that far ahead in detail, but at the moment, our annual sales are around JPY 4 billion. We've recently put together a five-year management plan with the goal of increasing that figure to JPY 6 billion.

If you're asking where we want to be by 2033, our target is to reach JPY 10 billion in sales. To achieve that, our overseas business development team will need to play a much larger role. They must become a core pillar of the company. By that time, we expect at least JPY 2 billion in sales to come from international markets.",https://www.theworldfolio.com/img_db/interviews/interview-689f42447a8f4.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 23:00:07.176110

The new strategy developed by the Queensland Renewable Energy Council shows more than 140 gigawatts of energy projects proposed in Queensland’s broader renewables pipeline[1], including almost 8GW of renewable generation and storage projects financially committed-to or already under construction, valued at more than $10.7 billion.

Much of it is located in, or targeted at regional or rural areas of the state.

If fully developed, 140 GW of renewable energy projects could power around 222 million homes – or every home in Queensland for more than a century, QREC says.

QREC chief executive officer Katie-Anne Mulder said Queensland Renewables Growth and Investment Strategy provided the clarity and stability required to give investors confidence, while ensuring communities remain at the centre of the energy transformation.

“Queenslanders have known about the importance of renewable energy for decades; whether it has been the Southern Cross windmills to pump water on farms, bagasse from our sugar mills, or solar panels on the rooves of more than half of Queensland homes,” she said.

“On a larger scale, renewable energy offers much more for Queensland. Already, almost 30pc of Queensland energy is generated from renewable energy,” she said.

“Queensland has the strongest renewable pipeline in Australia. But to turn projects into jobs, infrastructure and investment, we need clear, market-led strategies that give certainty to industry, communities, and investors.”

Ms Mulder said QREC was releasing the strategy to complement the Queensland Government’s work to develop its Energy Roadmap – expected to be released by the end of this year.

“This Strategy is the rubber hitting the Roadmap,” she said. “It’s the ‘how’ behind Queensland achieving economically-efficient emissions reduction.”

Flood of private capital for renewables projects

Last month, state treasurer and energy minister David Janetzki told a Budget Estimates hearing that his government wanted to see a flood of private capital coming toward renewables in Queensland.

“Queensland’s renewable energy story is not new. But the new chapters are to be written now. We must act now,” he said.

“This strategy provides a balanced plan that supports investment certainty, empowers regional communities, and ensures a reliable energy system for generations to come.”

Ms Mulder said the strategy would help secure the private capital Queensland needs, underpinned by three key pillars:

refocusing the energy system for long-term reliability and affordability,

partnering with regional Queensland for a coordinated, value-driven transition, and

creating a world-class development framework.

Recommendations

Fifteen recommendations are set out in the roadmap for Queensland to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy, while ensuring regional communities share in the benefits, Ms Mulder said.

They include:

Refocusing the Energy System for Long-Term Reliability and Affordability

Developing a state government investment prospectus with clear milestones for coal retirements and clarity on the role of government-owned corporations.

Redefining Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) as transmission coordination tools, with published timeframes and recognition of Readiness Assessments as social impact approvals.

Establishing a state-level plan for end-of-life solar panels, including regional recycling hubs and early funding incentives.

Providing targeted support for pumped hydro, with proactive site identification and a government–industry partnership model.

Partnering with Regional Queensland for a Coordinated, Value-Driven Transition

Adapting the Developer and Investor Toolkit into a mandatory landholder Code of Conduct.

Delivering an Integrated Energy and Agriculture Action Plan.

Strengthening First Nations participation, embedding the Commonwealth’s First Nations Clean Energy Strategy, funding capability programs, and reviving Queensland’s Remote and First Nations Energy Strategy.

Standardising Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs) with per-MW annual contributions or fixed negotiated models.

Exploring a centralised pooled community benefit fund for long-term regional priorities.

Creating a World-Class Development Framework to Unlock the Next Wave of Investment

Expanding the Resources Cabinet Committee to cover energy, ensuring whole-of-government coordination

Amending the Planning Act 2016 (Qld) to allow the Energy Minister to step in on projects critical to state objectives

Streamlining approvals with an updated Commonwealth–Queensland bilateral agreement, published timeframes, and technology-specific processes.

Developing fit-for-purpose mapping systems, including OSOM transport corridors and an energy project portal in GeoResGlobe.

Establishing a Queensland Wind Farm Transportation Group to implement logistics recommendations.

Creating a statewide decommissioning and financial security framework, led by Queensland Treasury, to cover all technologies fairly across their lifecycle.

In a revelation that could reshape America’s approach to securing vital resources, a new analysis published in the journal Science indicates that the United States is already extracting all the critical minerals it requires for energy, defense, and technology sectors—but discarding them as waste. According to the study, minerals like cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements are present in the tailings and byproducts of existing mining operations across the country. This oversight represents a missed opportunity to bolster domestic supply chains without the need for new mines, potentially alleviating geopolitical tensions over resource dependency.

The research, led by experts from the Colorado School of Mines and detailed in a report shared via Phys.org, quantifies the scale of this waste. Annually, U.S. mines produce enough discarded lithium to power 10 million electric vehicles, alongside substantial quantities of other essential materials. This comes at a time when demand for these minerals is surging due to the transition to renewable energy and advanced manufacturing.

Quantifying the Losses

Industry insiders have long suspected inefficiencies in mineral extraction, but this analysis provides concrete data. By examining waste streams from coal, copper, and other traditional mining sites, the study reveals that recovery technologies could capture these minerals economically. For instance, tailings from copper mines often contain cobalt, a key component in batteries, which is currently being dumped rather than processed.

Further insights from Grist highlight that the U.S. discards vast quantities of manganese and other elements critical for steel production and electronics. The economic implications are profound: recycling these waste streams could reduce reliance on imports from China, which dominates global refining capacity for many of these minerals, as noted in a Council on Foreign Relations overview.

Policy and Technological Implications

The findings align with recent government initiatives, such as the Department of the Interior’s efforts to recover critical minerals from mine waste, announced in July 2025. This push, detailed on the U.S. Department of the Interior’s website, aims to integrate advanced separation techniques into existing operations, potentially unlocking billions in value.

However, challenges remain. Mining companies must invest in new processing infrastructure, and regulatory hurdles could slow adoption. As Mining Technology reports, the initiative seeks to address national defense needs by tapping into domestic sources, reducing vulnerabilities exposed by global supply chain disruptions.

Geopolitical Ramifications

On the international front, this domestic potential contrasts with U.S. efforts to secure minerals abroad, such as deals in Africa and Ukraine, as covered by Reuters. By focusing inward, America could diminish China’s leverage in the critical minerals market, where Beijing controls much of the processing.

Experts argue that incentivizing waste recovery through tax credits or subsidies, similar to those in the Inflation Reduction Act, could accelerate progress. The analysis in Science underscores that with targeted investments, the U.S. could achieve self-sufficiency in critical minerals within years, transforming waste into a strategic asset.

Future Prospects and Industry Shifts

For mining executives and policymakers, the message is clear: innovation in extraction isn’t just about digging deeper but smarter. Companies like those profiled in Mother Jones are already exploring pilot projects to extract lithium from coal ash, demonstrating feasibility.

Ultimately, this shift could redefine the sector, promoting sustainability while enhancing security. As demand for electric vehicles and renewable tech grows, harnessing mine waste offers a pragmatic path forward, ensuring the U.S. doesn’t continue throwing away its future.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-9e66499a-49aa-4aac-94b5-4e489f266976.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 20:59:12.853148

Throughout the summer, NPR's Short Wave podcast has been bringing us the latest science from the depths of the ocean. And today, we travel to the sea floor, home to rare earth elements like cobalt, nickel and copper. These elements are used in everything from smartphones to electric cars to fighter jets.

WALTER SOGNNES: There is a reason why all countries and all nations - they have a critical minerals strategy. It's because the foundation for a green transition is all these different minerals.

RASCOE: That's Walter Sognnes, CEO of Glomar Minerals, a mining company based in the U.K. Companies like his and some countries, including the U.S., want to commercially mine the deep sea. But scientists are warning about the environmental impact. NPR's Emily Kwong has more.

EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: You may be wondering, why are there rare earth elements in the deep sea?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PART OF YOUR WORLD"")

JODI BENSON: (As Ariel, singing) Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?

KWONG: It's not because a little mermaid is down there hoarding treasure. Rather, rare earth elements accumulate over millions of years in these potato-sized lumps called polymetallic nodules found on the sea floor. Matthias Haeckel, a marine geochemist at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany, says these nodules are found in certain parts of the ocean and act as anchor points for all kinds of marine life.

MATTHIAS HAECKEL: I think the oldest nodule in the Pacific that has been dated was 14 million years old.

KWONG: In fact, the nodules grow at an average rate of tens of millimeters per million years through two main pathways - adsorption, which begins when a particle, like a fish bone or a shark tooth, falls to the ocean floor. And eventually, metals from the water column accumulate around that shark tooth, coating it with layers of metal. And the second way is diffusion. That's driven by microbes breaking down organic material.

Now, a lot of green technology is actually moving away from cobalt- and nickel-based batteries towards sodium-ion batteries or batteries made from renewable or recyclable material. But Sognnes maintains that the thirst for electric vehicles, wind turbines, weapons means that rare earth elements will have to come from somewhere and that the nodules in the ocean are a more reasonable place to get them.

SOGNNES: We believe that disturbance we are making in the ocean is a lesser effect than the mining in the rainforest, for instance.

KWONG: But what is the long-term damage to the ocean if these nodules are pulled up? Scientists have tried to predict that through experiments. One of the most significant is the European JPI Oceans project MiningImpact. A team led by Haeckel went to two places rich with nodules, the Clarion-Clipperton zone and the Peru Basin, where scientists in the '80s and '90s purposefully disturbed the sediment.

HAECKEL: To look how these experiment areas have evolved.

KWONG: Decades later, the sediment showed very little recovery.

HAECKEL: And the reason for that is that the energy flow into the deep sea is very low.

KWONG: Because less than 1% of marine snow or organic material falls into the deep sea, everything down there grows very, very slowly. So if mining were to ever happen and those nodules were removed, Haeckel says they would not come back any time soon.

HAECKEL: The specific fauna that needs these nodules for their life is gone permanently on our human timescales.

KWONG: These environments are fragile, and it's one of the reasons that 38 countries have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until scientists figure out the safest way to do it.

CleanTechnica readers will be familiar with Our Children’s Trust, a public interest law firm that specializes in bringing legal challenges on behalf of young clients. Dr. James Hansen, the noted NASA scientist who first testified in front of the US Congress about the connection between carbon dioxide and a warming, has been a vocal advocate for the group’s work.

In fact, his granddaughter was one of the young plaintiffs in the groundbreaking case of Juliana Vs. US, which sought to obtain a ruling that the federal government has a duty to protect the lives and health of its citizens, a position that is bitterly opposed by the fossil fuel industry.

Our Children’s Trust did achieve a milestone victory in Montana recently. Section 1 of Article IX of the Montana constitution says specifically:

The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.

The legislature shall provide for the administration and enforcement of this duty.

The legislature shall provide adequate remedies for the protection of the environmental life support system from degradation and provide adequate remedies to prevent unreasonable depletion and degradation of natural resources.

The Montana Supreme Court has now ruled that section means precisely what it says and has invalidated laws passed by the state’s legislature that were designed to limit the application of Article IX.

Wisconsin Lawsuit Challenges PSC Rules

Now Our Children’s Trust has teamed up with an environmental law firm in Wisconsin called Midwest Environmental Advocates to represent a group of 15 young Wisconsin residents in a legal action that seeks to invalidate two state statutes. They claim those statures unfairly benefit fossil fuel powered thermal electricity generation and limit the amount of renewable energy available within the state.

In addition, the lawsuit alleges the continued use of fossil fuels in energy generation is harming their young plaintiffs’ basic constitutional rights and creating an unstable future for them. The case was filed on August 22 against the Public Service Commission and the state legislature.

“The science around how climate change is going to affect Wisconsin is clear. It’s affecting us now. It’s only going to get worse, and it will get worse if Wisconsin keeps pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,” Tony Wilkin-Gibart, the executive director of MEA and one of the lawyers for the case, told the press.

“We believe that (their constitutional rights are) being violated by the state continuing to pump greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and drive the climate crisis in ways that are harming our clients and profoundly disrupting their ways of life and jeopardizing the stability of their future,” Wilkin Gibart said, according to a report by Wisconsin Public Radio.

“Our clients are asking the court to uphold their right to a livable future,” he said. “This case is about whether they will inherit a future shaped by clean energy and a stable climate — or one burdened by fossil fuel pollution, extreme weather events, and growing threats to their health and safety.”

Favoring Fossil Fuels

Specifically, one Wisconsin law today prevents the state’s public service commission from considering toxic and planet-heating air pollution when considering permits for new fossil fuel power plants, while another bars the PSC from requiring utilities to increase the amount of electricity they obtain from carbon-free sources.

“These laws set up a system where the public service commission continues to approve fossil fuel power plants and cannot bring online more renewable energy,” Nate Bellinger, supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust, told The Guardian. Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050, but those laws are diametrically opposed to implementing that policy initiative.

“The state legislature and the executive branch have both set goals and mandates to decarbonize the electricity sector,” said Bellinger. “These laws are getting in the way of that.” He claimed the laws in Wisconsin are ripe for a challenge. “The case is really a challenge to the electricity sector in Wisconsin, which is still predominantly powered by fossil fuels, and there’s a lot of opportunity there to transition that to renewables,” he said.

The lawsuit criticizes the PSC for not requiring utilities to invest more than 10% in renewable energy and points to policies in Wisconsin that give fossil fuels like coal and natural gas an edge when it comes to choosing and developing new power plants. Fossil fuels provide about 75 percent of Wisconsin’s electricity today.

“The trends that we’re seeing in Wisconsin are so profound, and the impacts of climate change are affecting Wisconsinites right now,” Wilkin-Gibart said. “We’re on track for a record number of smoke-filled days this summer. This entire summer has been marked by thoughts and anxiety about whether young people, and frankly any Wisconsinites, can go out and exercise and spend time with family.”

Health Risks

The complaint claims the young plaintiffs are exposed to a greater incidence of health risks, including asthma and respiratory illnesses made worse by increases in average temperatures and air pollution, flooding of their homes and communities, and mental health trauma tied to ecological loss and extreme weather events. Perhaps the latest study that shows climate-related pollution contributes to over 90,000 premature deaths in the US each year will bolster their case.

“We’re in a situation here in the state where we have state laws that tell our Public Service Commission to completely ignore these climate impacts, to completely ignore what our clients are experiencing, and to completely ignore the fate of these young people and future generations,” Wilkin-Gibart said.

Ted Schultz-Becker is one of the young plaintiffs. He said in a press release reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the lawsuit represents a chance to have the voices of Wisconsin youth heard. “These laws force my government to ignore science and pollution. That’s wrong and unconstitutional. Young people have power, even when we can’t vote. Our voices matter, and we trust our Constitution and courts to protect us.”

The attorneys are asking a judge to strike down state laws that limit consideration of climate effects and cap renewable energy requirements when regulators determine whether to approve or deny new projects. They want a judge to rule the laws violate their clients’ constitutional rights and find that the Public Service Commission and Legislature have a duty to protect the health and welfare of the young plaintiffs.

Republican Pushback

The lawsuit is likely to face opposition from the Republican-controlled Legislature and its top leaders. Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is on record as saying that climate change “probably” is real. Wisconsin Democrats have repeatedly introduced a package of bills to combat climate change and shift to clean energy, but Vos has said such efforts are only “pandering to the very liberal base.” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu has said such legislation would only “triple down on the ‘Green New Deal’ disaster.”

Republican lawmakers have also promoted legislation that would prevent state and local governments from enacting mandates that favor electric vehicles or restrict the use of propane or methane stoves, claiming they want to protect consumer choices. Governor Tony Evers vetoed those bills because he said they would limit the state’s ability to combat climate change.

If the latest lawsuit is successful, it will spark a torrent of backlash from Republicans in Wisconsin. In the event they follow the example set by so-called leaders at the national level, they may simply choose to ignore any court decision.

For years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which can burn fuel or run off a battery, have been tipped to fall as full-battery electric vehicles (BEVs) take their place.

But in Australia, another story is unfolding.

PHEV sales are booming.

One year ago, not a single PHEV ute had been sold anywhere in Australia.

Today, there are more than 12,000 on our roads, and a PHEV is the fourth best-selling ute in the country.

To some, PHEVs are a necessary ""stepping stone"" in the process of vehicle electrification, helping Australians get used to battery-powered cars.

But others argue PHEVs simply prolong our costly love affair with unnecessarily large cars.

These hybrids, they say, are effectively gas guzzlers dressed up as EVs, or ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".

So why are Australians reluctant to drop the fuel tank entirely, and what does it mean for reducing emissions?

Hybrid EVs versus full-battery EVs

The phrase electric vehicle (EV) may conjure images of 100 per cent battery-powered cars, but many EVs regularly burn fossil fuels.

And these cars make up an increasing proportion of the EV market.

Plug-in hybrids or PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine (like petrol or diesel) with an electric motor and a battery pack that can be charged from an external power source.

They generally emit less CO2 than equivalent-model full-combustion vehicles, but significantly more than BEVs, when used over an extended period of time.

This is because PHEV batteries are relatively small and, when they're empty, drivers tend to run the car on fossil fuels before recharging.

Plug-in hybrids now about a quarter of EVs sold

In two years, PHEVs have gone from about a tenth of total EV sales to about a quarter.

The rise of PHEVs is making the story of the electrification of transport in Australia more complicated.

You may have heard that EVs are accounting for a larger proportion of new car sales.

While this is true, a lot of the recent increase is due to PHEVs.

BEV sales, as a proportion of new car sales, have actually plateaued at less than 9 per cent over the past two years.

But PHEVs recently shot from 1 per cent to 5 per cent of sales in less than a year.

What's causing this deceleration is contested.

Globally, the pace of growth of EV sales outside of China has slowed, with EV market share in the US and Europe stagnating.

One theory is the BEV industry faces a challenge reaching customers beyond the ""early adopters"", partly due to concerns about charging infrastructure.

Another theory is the arrival of PHEVs has effectively siphoned sales from BEVs.

In Europe and the US, like in Australia, PHEV sales are booming.

Are plug-in hybrids helping or hindering fully electric car sales?

The popularity of PHEVs has defied predictions.

""Amongst the EV community we're a little surprised,"" Ben Elliston, chair of the ACT branch of the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA), says.

""PHEVs came out of nowhere in the last few years.

""It seemed clear to us that BEVs are the better technology but the mainstream buyer seems to have different ideas.""

Chris Jones, president of the AEVA, says PHEVs are undermining Australia's emission reduction goals.

But others in the automotive industry have a very different take.

They say PHEVs are cracking a consumer segment that isn't yet ready to go all-electric.

""They're a real stepping stone for people to ultimately move into a battery electric vehicle, but are not yet prepared to take that step,"" Rohan Martin, CEO of the National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association (NALSPA), says.

Aman Gaur, head of legal policy and advocacy at the Electric Vehicle Council, said many Australians wanted to buy big, powerful cars like SUV and utes.

PHEVs are meeting demand currently unserved by BEVs, he says, noting that some vehicle electrification is better than none.

""We don’t live in the kind of country where we tell people what car to buy,"" he says.

Mike Costello, an analyst for automotive research firm Manheim Australia, says ""PHEVs are competing for the middle ground"", not just ""the so-called early adopters"".

""The BYD Shark ute for, example isn't just preaching to the converted, it’s pulling people out of [full combustion] four-wheel drives.

""There's little doubt some people would have traded in [Toyota] Hiluxes and [Ford] Rangers [for Sharks].""

Who's buying PHEVs?

Michael Formosa, whose company services and repairs garage doors and gates in Sydney, traded in four Ford Ranger diesel utes for four PHEV utes in December last year.

Other than a few issues with battery range when towing, he's happy with the decision, which has meant spending less on fuel.

""I worked out we're doing about an eighth [of our travelling] in petrol and the rest in [battery power],"" he says.

Utes account for about 20 per cent of all vehicles sold in Australia, making them a big chunk of the market.

The only BEV or fully-electric ute available in Australia, the LDV eT60, has had well-documented performance problems, and is a third more expensive than popular PHEV models. Eight have been sold in Australia so far this year.

""There isn't yet a fit-for-purpose BEV for light commercial vehicles,"" Mace Hartley, executive director of Australasian Fleet Management Association, says.

PHEVs, meanwhile, now account for more than 7 per cent of sales in the ute market.

This suggests tradies like Michael are buying PHEVs instead of petrol or diesel utes, and not instead of BEVs.

But utes aren't the only kind of PHEV selling well.

About half of PHEVs sold in 2025 were small or medium-size SUVs, a vehicle class that, unlike utes, includes lots of popular BEVs.

Here, it's harder to argue PHEVs are serving a demand unmet by BEVs.

A 2024 NALSPA survey found that, compared to BEV owners, a relatively high proportion of PHEV drivers lived in outer suburbs or were based in regional areas.

Many weren't yet ready for a BEV due to range anxiety, but would consider one as their next car.

""If you're charging a PHEV at home each night, you can run it as a pure electric vehicle and not have range concerns,"" NALSPA's Rohan Martin says.

But the AEVA's Chris Jones says Australians are simply buying what dealerships are stocking and promoting.

""We've become hooked on these large and somewhat unnecessary vehicles,"" he says.

""Dealers will claim that's what people want, but when you walk into a dealership you see a wall of PHEVs ... and the BEVs are harder to find.""

Are PHEVs good or bad news for emissions?

When burning fuel rather than running on battery power, PHEVs (which carry heavy batteries) actually emit more than their full-combustion equivalents.

They're only low-emission options if drivers plug them in to recharge.

This means if they're not being recharged, more PHEVs could amount to more higher-polluting cars on our roads.

A recent study from Europe, using onboard fuel-consumption data, found many PHEV drivers often don't recharge.

As a result, PHEVs may not be as clean as their rated emissions suggest (these ratings are based on the assumption drivers charge more often).

Based on the study's results, PHEVs may only be about half as polluting as their full-combustion equivalents.

That's good, but only as good as a standard hybrid (a vehicle with an onboard battery that can't be plugged in to charge).

""They're not going to decarbonise transport like we need them to,"" Mr Jones says.

Modelling of the EV uptake required to meet Australia's Paris Agreement emissions reduction commitment assumes PHEVs will account for 4–5 per cent of new car sales by 2030.

That's roughly where PHEV sales are now, but the long-term trend appears to be upwards.

Are plug-in hybrids the future or a temporary convenience?

Earlier this year, the federal government lifted a key tax exemption for PHEVs, effectively making them more expensive to own through a novated lease.

""The prevailing sense within the industry was the lifting of the [tax] exemption would stall PHEV sales, but this hasn’t happened,"" Manheim Australia's Mike Costello says.

""They’ve slowed but not stalled.”

Rather than shifting away from plug-ins, automotive brands are launching more PHEV models in the Australian market.

The Toyota RAV4, a top-selling medium SUV, will come with a PHEV option from 2026.

BYD, meanwhile, will launch a mix of four to five new PHEV and BEV models in Australia over the next six months, the company's chief operating officer Stephen Collins says.

The future of PHEVs partly depends on whether car companies can build a BEV ute that Australians want to buy.

If they do, the rise of PHEVs may be just a flash in the pan.

According to Mace Hartley from Australasian Fleet Management Association, Australia is ""18 months away from having BEV equivalents of the BYD Shark"".

Aman Gaur from the EV Council says improving battery technology means BEVs are the future, but plug-ins have a crucial role to play in the present.

""What we need is incentives to help people get into PHEV vehicles. We don't have any at the moment,"" he says.

""How are we getting people off petrol utes and into electrified utes?""

BYD's Stephen Collins says ""there's a place for plug-in hybrids in Australia over the next three to five years"".

""If we're looking at 10-years plus, maybe it's a different story.""

Batteries may be the future of transport, but the road to electrification is a twisty one.

And the upstart plug-in is showing no sign of going away.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/77bf98d97ab1db9efa4178b88a758f99?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2288&cropW=4068&xPos=613&yPos=528&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-08-24 21:00:01.734871

Further reform and incentives are needed to transition into scaling down coal power generation and planning a coal exit strategy: in H1 2025, only 1 GW of coal power was retired.
Construction starts and restarts reached 46GW, equivalent to the entire coal power capacity of South Korea and sustaining the high pace set in 2022.
Current dispatch practices predominantly rely on coal power plants for ramping up power generation when needed, with minimal incentives or explicit requirements to flexibly scale down power generation.
Policy recommendations To align China’s power system with its dual carbon goals and avoid locking in unnecessary coal power capacity, we recommend the following actions:","The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and Global Energy Monitor (GEM) have released their H1 2025 biannual review of China’s coal projects, which finds that coal power additions are continuing to grow.

Although there were some signs of coal power slowing down in 2024 and 2025 has seen China’s clean energy boom meet a significant amount of power demand growth and lower CO2 emissions, coal power remains strong, with new and revived projects the highest in a decade.

In H1 2025, 21 gigawatts (GW) of coal power were commissioned, the highest amount in the first half of the year since 2016, with projections for the full year exceeding 80 GW. This increase in commissions follows on the tail of the 2022-2023 coal power permitting surge that saw two new coal projects permitted per week, on average, totalling more than 100 GW of coal power approved per year. This trend will likely continue into 2026 and 2027, unless policy action is taken.

Only 25 GW were permitted in H1 2025, yet new and revived projects came to 75 GW in H1 2025, the highest in a decade, and construction starts and restarts reached 46 GW, equivalent to the entire coal power capacity of South Korea.

This rush of activity signals possible pressure from the industry to expand coal projects as a last ditch effort before China’s 2030 carbon peaking deadline, right when strategic phase-down should be the priority to meet climate goals and as clean energy is meeting all of new power demand growth.

In June 2025, coal’s share in power generation dropped to a nine-year low of 51%, and only made up 34% of China’s total installed capacity, while renewables accounted for 60%, pointing to the ongoing trend of coal losing steam while an artificial push attempts to expand rather than phase down its historic role.

Although China pledged in 2022 that coal should play a flexible, supporting role while renewables are integrated, this policy has yet to be implemented in any meaningful way. Further reform and incentives are needed to transition into scaling down coal power generation and planning a coal exit strategy: in H1 2025, only 1 GW of coal power was retired. 13 GW need to be retired by the end of 2025 to meet the 14th Five-Year Plan goal of retiring 30 GW by the end of 2025.

With the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and 15th Five-Year Plan on the horizon, China has a critical opportunity to set binding targets and initiate policy reform that could confirm China’s role as a global leader in the energy transition.

Key findings:

Coal power construction and commissioned projects remain high, with no clear signs of slowing. 21 gigawatts (GW) was commissioned in H1 2025, the highest first-half total since 2016. And full-year additions are expected to exceed 80 GW, according to association projections. Construction starts and restarts reached 46GW, equivalent to the entire coal power capacity of South Korea and sustaining the high pace set in 2022.

New project approvals remain strong, with signs of pre-carbon peak acceleration. 25 GW was permitted in H1 2025, slightly down from previous years. However, new and revived proposals totalled 75 GW, the highest H1 figure in a decade, reflecting a continued push to advance coal projects before the 2030 carbon peaking deadline.

The commissioning boom of 2025 reflects a delayed response to the permitting surge of 2022–2023, when more than 100 GW of coal power was approved each year. Unless policy action is taken, these previously approved projects will continue to drive high levels of commissioning in 2026–2027.

Clean energy is expanding at unprecedented speed, reshaping China’s power mix, while coal’s role in generation continues to decline. Wind and solar additions are expected to exceed 500 GW in 2025, which is more than enough to meet total electricity demand growth. Coal’s share in power generation dropped to a historic low of 51% in June 2025. At the same time, renewables account for 60% of total installed capacity, compared to about 34% for coal. Yet coal capacity continues to rise, highlighting a widening disconnect between capacity growth and actual power generation.

Coal power is not fulfilling its intended role as a flexible backup for renewables. Current dispatch practices predominantly rely on coal power plants for ramping up power generation when needed, with minimal incentives or explicit requirements to flexibly scale down power generation.

China still lacks a coherent coal exit strategy, and power plant retirements are far behind official targets. Only 1 GW of coal power was retired in H1 2025, with just 16 GW retired since 2021. To meet the 14th Five-Year Plan goal of 30 GW by the end of 2025, 13 GW would need to be retired in H2, which appears to be an increasingly unlikely prospect.

The upcoming Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and 15th Five-Year Plan offer a crucial opportunity to establish a clear, coordinated roadmap for managing coal power’s decline. While China’s energy policy direction is aligned with long-term climate goals, the absence of binding targets and institutional reform has allowed legacy incentives for coal power to persist. Without stronger national guidance, clean energy progress may be offset by continued coal expansion, delaying energy transition and stalling emission reductions.

Energy prices have already become a key issue in the governor’s race in Virginia, which is home to dozens of energy-guzzling data centers.","EARLIER THIS YEAR when Democratic officials began to strategize about the midterm elections, there was widespread agreement that their message should emphasize rising costs. In the Democratic campaign committees and up and down the halls of Congress, the consensus was that the party should focus relentlessly on Donald Trump’s tariffs and the GOP’s Medicaid cuts.

But that focus has started to shift.

High prices are still the main theme, and Medicaid cuts and tariffs will continue to be an important component of Democrats’ midterms argument. But the party increasingly sees political opportunity in centering its message on rising energy prices. As electricity bills are spiking around the country—rising twice as fast as the rate of inflation—Democrats have started to weave the issue into more of their ads and talking points, believing it’s an effective way to tar a president who reneged on his commitment to lower prices.

Most of the Democratic consultants and lawmakers that I spoke to for this newsletter said that energy prices are easier to talk about on the campaign trail than tariffs (especially when some Democrats have gotten tripped up talking about the merits of “targeted tariffs”). Soaring energy bills will also be of interest to a wider audience than, say, Trump’s Medicaid cuts, as energy prices affect nearly all Americans. And the sense is that this issue is only going to become more pressing: Energy is expected to keep getting more expensive before next November.

Plus, Democrats believe, it’s fairly straightforward to explain why Republicans are to blame.

“They ran on this platform of lowering costs. And Trump and Republicans in Congress then passed legislation that will increase costs across the board,” said Sara Schreiber, the senior vice president of campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters, which recently launched a $4 million push in swing states on the GOP budget law. “It’s an intuitive thing. You’re thinking about your electric bill all year round.”

A few other recent efforts:

This month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran digital ads focusing on rising energy costs. It has also been more aggressive about amplifying local coverage of spiking costs.

Clean Energy for America, an advocacy group, recently ran billboard ads in swing districts going after Republican House members who “just voted to raise your electricity bill.”

Climate Power, a Democratic-aligned advocacy organization, is airing an ad blaming Trump for higher energy costs.

And the Democratic National Committee has also been focusing on the issue, with plans to have former Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (who now works at Climate Power) on their YouTube show this week to highlight the topic.

Beyond the 2026 midterms, rising energy costs also present Democrats and climate groups with an opportunity to hit reset on the issue. For much of the last quarter-century, from the days of Al Gore through the debates over the carbon tax, the party has struggled to talk about climate change without using alarmist rhetoric that feels divorced from most voters’ focus on the dollars and cents of their energy bills. Efforts from lawmakers and climate advocates to center the conversation on pocketbook issues haven’t generally been effective, leaving Democrats vulnerable to GOP attacks. But there’s growing hope that will change this election cycle.

“It is critical to talk about climate change in an economic frame,” said Christina Polizzi, a spokesperson for Climate Power. “It is a political liability for Republicans to directly raise costs on Americans across the country, and for Donald Trump to say, ‘Hey, you’re on your own if an extreme weather event comes to your town.’”

Even before the Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill” was signed into law, energy prices were rising in part due to new data centers for cryptocurrencies and AI. But the bill compounded that issue by stripping away Biden-era federal tax credits for cheaper renewable energy like wind and solar. Recent analyses found that the new law could increase the average family’s energy bill by as much as $400 per year within a decade.

Plus, the argument could be more potent in red states that will lose clean-energy jobs under the new law as well as states with more extreme climates that make voters especially vulnerable to increased prices. JoAnna Mendoza, a retired Marine who is running in the Democratic primary for the chance to challenge Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District, has focused a lot of her campaign messaging so far on rising energy bills.

“In Arizona, it is hot as hell. It is so freaking hot, it’s triple digits. AC is on nonstop. Just last month, I had a $400 bill and I know I’m not alone,” Mendoza said in a phone interview. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, an independent, a Democrat, or you don’t follow party politics at all—you’re going to feel it in your pocketbook.”

In a social media post last week, Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego described it as a matter of life or death: “Across the country electricity prices are rising twice as fast as inflation. Families already stretched thin can’t afford it. And in Arizona in August, this isn’t just about comfort. It’s about survival.”

Most Democratic officials that I spoke with last week said that the fact that Republicans were already acting anxious and attempting to blame this problem on past Democratic administrations was a sign that Democrats had landed on a winning issue.

Listen, for example, to how Donald Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, talks about the blame game. “The momentum of the Obama-Biden policies, for sure that destruction is going to continue in the coming years,” the former fracking CEO said in an interview last week with Politico. “That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

Democrats are counting on that.

🫏 Donkey Business:

— Among the most contentious subjects the Democratic National Committee will discuss at its annual summer meeting this week is the 2028 primary calendar. Alex Thompson reports in Axios that “Nevada, New Hampshire, and Michigan are currently the frontrunners to be ‘the new Iowa,’ and lead off the 2028 Democratic primary season.” Potential presidential candidates are already reaching out to DNC members to quietly develop relationships with them before they lock in the calendar.

The primary calendar might seem in the weeds, but whatever the DNC ends up deciding will say a lot about how they view the future of the party and which parts of their coalition they want to prioritize.

Some party leaders that I’ve spoken to about this in the past few weeks have expressed concern about going with a bigger state like Michigan where the candidate with the most money to run TV ads will be at an advantage. Thompson also notes that some “operatives worry that a spotlight on the state’s large Arab and Jewish populations could further stoke divisions in the party over the war in Gaza.” Other party leaders have suggested that they ought to go with a smaller, more rural state (like Iowa!) that would force candidates to tailor their message to parts of the country that have turned away from Democrats in recent elections.

— As the two most populous states move forward with their plans to redraw their congressional maps—with a more-red Texas map just awaiting Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature and a more-blue California map to be voted on in a special election this November—pressure is growing on other states to also take action ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans are eyeing Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana as potential opportunities to pad their advantage in the House while Democratic leaders in New York, Illinois, and Maryland are considering their options. Republicans still have a clear advantage here, since more Democratic-leaning states have independent redistricting commissions that complicate mid-decade map drawing. Yet Democratic leaders are still urging them to act.

“Right now, these other states need to step up,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) told Politico. “I know it’s hard, I know it’s complicated. . . . But, if you’re a blue state governor, the time is now to step up and get it done.”

In addition to the diversity of experiences we enjoy, as one of your elected county commissioners, I know very well from my many conversations the diversity of opinions we also have here. I’m fortunate to work with the conservation community to protect our vast open lands one day, and then, the very next, the ranching community to support their requests for compensation from the challenges inherent to the reintroduction of wolves into our ecosystems.

I know we do not agree on everything, but one area where we can come together is that sound science should inform decision-making. Since 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has relied upon the Endangerment Finding, which recognizes greenhouse-gas emissions endanger our health and welfare. This finding is based on well-established, scientific research that has been proven over the decades.

Unfortunately, we are no strangers to the impacts of climate change. We have lower spring snowpack, earlier spring runoff due to increasing temperatures, and an increase of 40 frost-free days on average from the 1960s to the 2010s. The serviceberries and Gambel oak leaves are crimson, flaxen, and plum — and not from lower evening temperatures but from this extreme drought we face. The leaves are covering the trail in August; marcescence, there is no delay to their leaf drop. This extreme drought we face is impacting nearly everyone around. Many of us are under water restrictions. I had several conversations with ranchers who received the earliest call ever from the District 5 Water Engineer to shut off their ditches. A neighbor’s well is dry in August, and she is looking for solutions for her family and her neighbors. No matter your perspectives on climate change, we can all agree it’s getting hotter and drier here in the valley, and that inaction is unacceptable.

That’s why we are leading the way in Pitkin County. We approved 18,300 solar panels on a former bio-solids waste site. We had Olympic athletes and elementary school students testify in support of a solar array off of Highway 82. In 2025, CORE, one of our key partners, has awarded over $750,000 in grants to valley residents, businesses, and governments to electrify everything from induction cooktop to cold source heat pumps.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Support 50% renewable energy generation targets by 2030.

Establish bankable projects financed under EXIM Bank programs, reducing reliance on non-compliant imports.

Create local employment opportunities in engineering, manufacturing, and project execution.

Deliver secure, future-proof energy systems that align with U.S. and Saudi regulatory frameworks.

The cost of adding a 30-amp, 240-volt outlet to a garage for EV charging can be quite expensive.
Home ownership is now a luxury most of us can not afford, and multi-family dwellings are severely lacking in EV charging capabilities.
That leaves residents reliant on our lacking public EV charging infrastructure.","One of the biggest obstacles to EV adoption is that public charging infrastructure can't keep up with demand. Charging at home, for those who are able, is a great way around this, except for one small problem. According to Telemetry, we're too lazy to clean out our garages.

As of a 2021 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 42% of homeowners already park close to a 240-volt outlet capable of Level 2 charging, regardless of what they drive. But a lot of people use their garages for general storage rather than parking a car inside. Using a garage for its intended purpose would, in itself, give 68% of homeowners easy access to a charging outlet with no other changes required.

To put it another way, 31 million homes are currently capable of EV charging, according to Ars Technica. Simply cleaning out the garage and parking inside would increase that number to 50 million homes. In many cases, 90% according to Telemetry, it's possible to add a 240-volt outlet to a garage that doesn't already have one. Doing so brings the number of homes capable of EV charging to 72 million.

While these numbers sound like sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows for the future of EVs, the real world is a bit more complicated. The cost of adding a 30-amp, 240-volt outlet to a garage for EV charging can be quite expensive. This is particularly true of older homes, built when practical EVs were just a figment of our imagination, but even some newer homes may not support this. It can cost thousands of dollars to have a suitable outlet installed, which negates or even exceeds the cost savings of buying an EV in the first place. While it is a one-time purchase that will support whatever EVs you plug in for many years to come, that initial cost is a hurdle many homeowners can not afford to overcome.

Of course, this assumes you can afford to buy a house in the first place. Households now require an annual income of $118,530 to afford the average American house, more than 52% above the median income, according to Investopedia. Home ownership is now a luxury most of us can not afford, and multi-family dwellings are severely lacking in EV charging capabilities. That leaves residents reliant on our lacking public EV charging infrastructure. At least the $5 billion allocated to expand and improve this is still there despite the Trump Administration's efforts to stop it, as we predicted.

READ MORE:

Expert say Revolution Wind has reportedly created more than 1,200 jobs in the region.

Many of those new jobs are occupied by union workers, and some told NBC 10 they were caught off guard by the stop-work order.

With 45 turbines already in the ocean 15 miles from the Rhode Island coast (and Orsted, the project's parent company, planning to install 20 more), some union experts say Revolution Wind has been a game changer for several Ocean State residents.

""[This impacts] hundreds of workers. There's 300 union jobs that are being performed out on the ocean right now and another 360 on shore,"" said Patrick Crowley, the President of Rhode Island's AFL-CIO chapter. ""People are frustrated right now. This is an important part of our economy. These are good union jobs.""

Some critics of the Revolution Wind project say the national security concerns and impact on the commercial fishing industry would be harmful.

Even with this criticism, amplified by the Trump administration's decision Friday, some members of Rhode Island's Congressional delegation are pushing back to try and get the project across the finish line.

""We're trying to determine what leverage we can pull that'll help get this project recommenced and completed,"" said Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI).

Senator Reed believes the work stoppage could be a bargaining chip for the Trump administration, referring to the saga with Equinor's Empire Wind project in New York a couple of months ago.

""[The Trump Administration] went to [New York Governor Kathy Hochul] and said 'we want you to approve a natural gas pipeline which was having difficulty being approved.' Well eventually, surprise, the pipeline got approved and they lifted the ban on the completion of the project,"" Sen. Reed said.

Orsted said in a statement that they are working to resolve the stoppage and complete the project before the end of 2026.",https://turnto10.com/resources/media/e38c99b4-1d25-46be-a186-0f960dca45cc-large16x9_McKeeWindEventpresser_frame_105165.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 19:01:17.175448

Earlier this month, Orsted sought the $9.4 billion of financing from shareholders to help fund its Sunrise Wind project off the New York coast after potential partners pulled out due to Trump's hostility to wind power.

With construction now frozen at 80% completion, Orsted has no immediate path to revenue generation, heightening pressure on the company as it seeks to shore up finances through a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue.

The stop-work order, issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), is the administration's latest effort to hinder U.S. renewable energy development and is the second time this year the Interior Department, which oversees BOEM, has halted work on a major offshore wind project.

""Orsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it was reviewing the financial implications of the order and was considering legal action.

The company said it would ""in due course"" advise the market on the potential impact on its plans to conduct the rights issue.

Orsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states.

Orsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind.

A spokesperson for the company, owned 50.1% by the Danish state, declined to comment further.

On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump suspended new offshore wind leasing pending an environmental and economic review of projects. He has repeatedly criticized wind energy as ugly, unreliable and expensive.

The $1.5 billion project that Orsted was constructing, Revolution Wind, was scheduled to be completed next year and expected to produce enough electricity to power 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

All offshore foundations had been installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines were already in place, Orsted said.

The National Ocean Energy Industries Association, an industry trade group, said halting work on a project that is almost finished would jeopardize jobs and investment.

“These projects are not only about energy,"" NOIA President Erik Milito said. ""They advance priorities of the Administration by restoring American manufacturing, strengthening shipbuilding, modernizing ports, and building the reliable power needed to support data centers and AI innovation.

“Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power. That is not enough to meet America’s rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies. Offshore projects take years of investment before delivering results, and stable, consistent policy is essential to keep that progress moving.""

The stop-work order is driven by unspecified national security concerns arising from the administration's review of offshore wind projects in federal waters, according to the letter, signed by BOEM acting Director Matthew Giacona.

The bureau is seeking to protect U.S. national security and prevent ""interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas,"" Giacona said.

Orsted is among the biggest global offshore wind companies, but its U.S. business has suffered setbacks in addition to the broader challenges facing the global offshore wind industry, which is struggling to meet ambitious government targets amid soaring costs and project delays.

Earlier this month, Orsted sought the $9.4 billion of financing from shareholders to help fund its Sunrise Wind project off the New York coast after potential partners pulled out due to Trump's hostility to wind power.

Potential co-investors for the Sunrise Wind project pulled out after Trump's administration in April ordered Equinor to halt the development of a fully-permitted wind farm.

LAND TRANSPORT (CLEAN VEHICLE STANDARD) AMENDMENT BILL (NO 2)

First Reading

Hon CHRIS BISHOP (Minister of Transport): Madam Speaker, I present a legislative statement on the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2).

DEPUTY SPEAKER: That legislative statement is published under the authority of the House and can be found on the Parliament website.

Hon CHRIS BISHOP: I move, That the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2) be now read a first time. I nominate the Transport and Infrastructure Committee to consider the bill, with a period of four months and one day for the select committee process.

This bill is a short bill that makes needed changes to make it more likely that New Zealanders will benefit from the clean vehicle standard rather than face higher vehicle prices because of it. The standard is our light vehicle fuel-efficiency or carbon dioxide standard. If it works as intended, New Zealanders will benefit from estimated fuel savings of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion over 2023 to 2050 and 8.2 million to 9.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission reductions over the same period.

We’ll only achieve those benefits if vehicle importers achieve the standard’s annual carbon dioxide targets. This is because every vehicle that doesn’t achieve its target attracts charges. If importers can’t offset those charges with credits earned on low-emissions vehicles, then those charges flow through into high vehicle prices. Higher prices will make it even harder for New Zealanders to afford to replace their vehicles with more fuel-efficient and lower-emitting vehicles. To prevent this outcome, the bill gives importers more flexibility in how and when they comply with the targets; flexibility is critical because importers can’t control all the factors affecting whether they can supply the low-emissions vehicles needed to comply with the targets, nor can they control whether consumers will buy them.

Currently, many importers are not achieving their targets and are attracting charges because of unfavourable supply-and-demand conditions. For example, there is currently a shortage of used EVs available for importers to supply to our market, so the bill makes it easier for importers to offset charges with credits. There are three main ways it does this.

First, it allows credits to be transferred between used-vehicle importers and new-vehicle importers; currently this can’t happen because credit transfers between the sectors are prohibited. To acknowledge the greater fuel-saving value of new low-emissions vehicles, the bill sets a 2:1 exchange rate—so you’ll need two credits earned on used vehicles to offset a charge on a new vehicle. Secondly, the bill extends the lifespan of credits from three years to four years. This gives importers more time to use the credits that they earn from importing volumes of fuel-efficient vehicles. Third, the bill extends the ability for importers to offset the charges accrued in a year by supplying and selling more low-emissions vehicles the following year when conditions improve. Currently, the ability to borrow credits will stop at the end of 2025.

Finally, the bill futureproofs the standard by enabling targets to be set that are not adjusted by vehicle weight. It’s the Government’s view that this ability will be needed over the next five years as EVs and hybrids disrupt the traditional positive relationship between vehicle weight, fuel use, and emissions. In other words, soon, large SUVs will not need easier targets than small hatchbacks. The bill makes it more likely that the standards’ annual carbon dioxide targets will be achieved, and, by doing this, New Zealanders will have access to vehicles that cost less at the pump and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

So, with those brief remarks, I commend the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2) to the House.

ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The question is that the motion be agreed to.

Hon Dr DEBORAH RUSSELL (Labour): This bill is a bit of a shocker, really. It’s an extraordinary thing that that side of the House is doing. It stacks up with all their other climate-denying work, but this one is a bit of a corker.

I don’t get it. The reason that we have clean car emission standards is so that we start transitioning our fleet from internal combustion, using fossil fuels, to electric vehicles. The idea is to actually decrease emissions. It’s a critical need. We have a Paris target of reducing our climate emissions to net zero by 2050, and the way we have been trying to do that is, primarily, so far under this Government, by planting more trees. We’ve carried on emitting carbon. We’re not trying to get actual carbon emissions down. Instead, we’re just offsetting them with trees. The trouble is that that approach is going to fail. We cannot plant our way out of climate change. In order to effectively address climate change, we have to get emissions down.

There are two major sources of greenhouse gas emissions in our country—two major industries or areas of our economy that we get greenhouse gases from. One is from agriculture, and there is whole lot of work going on in that space to see how we can actually reduce methane flow. That’s what we have to do with methane flow. The other is transport. Transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. And unlike methane, where there are some pretty interesting technologies coming through which may help with that—in terms of carbon, we have to get the emissions down.

The clean car standards were a part of that. The whole idea was to incentivise the transfer over to an electric vehicle fleet. There were a whole lot of strategies around that. One was the Clean Car Discount, a scheme that was working really well; and one was this clean car importer standard. This whole clean car importer standard was a way of incentivising the uptake of electric vehicles by ensuring that we had to bring more electric vehicles into the country in the first place. This bill changes that around. It’s noticeable, in the departmental disclosure statement, that the people that were consulted with included the motor vehicle industry but did not include the Climate Change Commission. In fact, there’s very little assessment of the impact that it will have on our climate emissions. Going through in terms of deciding on which option was best to address this policy, the people who had all the input on it were various industry stakeholders. They were the people who were consulted to see whether or not we should change around the Clean Vehicle Standard.

Going through the regulatory impact statement is quite an eye opener. I’ll see if I can find the relevant bits. The way it sets it out is it says that current vehicle importers were not going to meet the target for importing clean vehicles, so they’ve changed the targets. They’ve just simply changed the targets. Well, that’s not going to get emissions down, is it? “Oh, we’re not going to be able to do it, so we just won’t do it.” But we still need to get emissions down. Climate change is a pressing, pressing need for us to address. What are they doing? They’re consulting vehicle importers about how to avoid getting emissions down. It’s a shocking bill, and it demonstrates, yet again, that this Government is not—is not—committed to addressing climate change. The Labour Party does not support this bill.

ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The member’s time has expired.

Hon JULIE ANNE GENTER (Green—Rongotai): Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Kia orana, Mr Speaker, and tēnā koutou e te Whare. The Green Party is not supporting this bill. As someone who worked closely on both the Clean Car Standard and the Clean Car Discount in the initial days, I can tell you that those were evidence-based policies that have been used in other jurisdictions to improve fuel economy. And the overall benefits to New Zealand of having more efficient vehicles is undeniable, because we spend more money to drive a given amount on petrol or on diesel, as a consequence of having less efficient vehicles. There’s this bizarre ideology on the other side of the House that somehow having more polluting vehicles is good for New Zealand; it’s not. It’s not good for New Zealand.

The way that the Clean Car Standard and the Clean Car Discount worked was intentionally done so that they worked together. The idea of the standard is quite simple. It’s that over time we’re expecting vehicle importers of both new and second-hand vehicles to improve the fuel efficiency of the vehicles that are being imported. The Clean Car Discount used a feebate signal, which was a levy on polluting vehicles, which is recycled into a discount or a rebate on zero-emissions and low-emissions vehicles. That feebate was actually far more effective than I think anyone realised. I mean, I knew it would be effective, hence why we worked on the policy, but when they actually brought it in, the Labour Government brought it in, it was massively successful and effective.

Usually, the vehicle importers understand that they want something like the Clean Car Discount. They find it difficult to implement the standards without the overt price signal. So the reason why the Government is now having to come back again with another bill to amend the clean vehicle standard—now, this is the second amendment bill in just a few months—is to give importers more flexibility to achieve the standard. Ultimately, what it’s doing is just making it harder for us to achieve the actual targets to achieve the goal.

As the Climate Commission recently recognised, the Government has no plan to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels or things that create greenhouse gas emissions, and that is totally ridiculous in 2025. It’s completely ridiculous, and it’s particularly ridiculous, when you consider that everything we do to reduce the fossil fuel intensity of our vehicle fleet is not just beneficial from a climate point of view, it’s beneficial from an air pollution point of view, it’s beneficial from a pure cost point of view, and from an energy sovereignty point of view.

We have majority renewable electricity generated in this country, right here in this country. Electric vehicles are far more efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles. So just switching to electric vehicles is an efficiency gain, a massive efficiency gain. It doesn’t matter how that electricity is generated. Even if it was generated from coal, it would still be more energy efficient. Now, personally, the Green Party doesn’t believe we should be using coal to generate electricity; there’s no question. But even if it were the case, an electric vehicle would be more efficient than a combustion engine vehicle. So we have everything to gain from switching to more efficient vehicles.

But guess who doesn’t want us to switch more efficient vehicles? The vehicle manufacturers. And the oil companies, obviously. Why? It doesn’t benefit New Zealanders. People would like to spend less money on driving around, wouldn’t they? Well, the best way to do that is to make sure that the vehicles coming into the country are more efficient. And every country in the world that has achieved progress in the area has done so through a combination of standards and price incentives. That’s what works, and the economic benefits massively outweigh the cost.

So, you know, classic National-led Government being lobbied by big corporate interests, and who misses out? Who’s paying the bills on this? Who’s paying for it? It’s New Zealanders paying higher petrol bills, higher diesel bills, higher hospital bills, higher emissions, which is going to cost us in the medium and long term. But this is a Government of absolute climate deniers who can’t even understand how the economy works. I mean, they’re claiming victory from dropping interest rates. Geniuses! They dropped the interest rates because the economy crashed.

MARK CAMERON (ACT): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I must confess to the House that I’m not the actual speaker that would normally speak to this bill, but I have a couple of thoughts, if I may. I can imagine the heckling will begin, at some point in the near future, from my team on the left. But I’m fascinated when I’m trying to digest what the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2) looks like in the real world—in the real world of choice. I think, in a house of debate—and this is, of course, a house of debate—that New Zealanders are a group of collective deniers. Well, certainly, this side of the House is.

As we speak to what this bill does, it extends the lifespan of carbon dioxide emissions credits that are earned on low-emission vehicles—yeah, three or four years—and removes the restriction on carbon dioxide emission credit transfers between new and used importers and various sectors.

I just want to touch on a point that the previous member did make—that this side of the House were climate change deniers. I find that an oddity that that side of the House, if I could be so obliging to share a couple of thoughts pursuant to Indonesian coal—now, in the world of hydrocarbons, if I get the pronunciation correct, we have seen huge increases to hydrocarbons, like coal in this instance, coming into New Zealand. That helps electrify the grid. If we look at the world of averages—whether it’s electrification and the use of electrified vehicles in this instance or hydrocarbons being used for the sake of petroleum by-products or petroleum or diesel or petrol—how can we not square up, either way when we’re having this debate, that invariably there’s an endpoint user that has a pollution problem. Now, it could be the electrification of the grid and a greater consumption of it, or it could be used in hydrocarbons that are used in motor vehicles that happen to be internal combustion engines.

I am a bit struck by Julie Anne Genter’s remarks. I don’t think it is balanced to say, in this instance, that members on this side of this House are climate change deniers. We’re just having a balanced debate. Where I land on this bill, having not had a chance to read a great deal of it—I maintain that it sort of lands on about the right place in the world of averages, so, on that basis, I commend it to the House.

ANDY FOSTER (NZ First): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on behalf of New Zealand First to speak on this Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2). This is something I think was signalled in the 2024 Budget that this work was going to be done. In fact, it’s interesting in the speaking notes I’ve got here that I refer to it being proposed by the Hon Simeon Brown. So it suggests it was a little while ago that this was being talked about.

This clean vehicle standard is about trying to make sure that over time the emission levels, which are produced by vehicles which are imported into this country, are progressively reduced. That doesn’t change in this bill. What this bill is mostly about is two things. The first one of those is about saying, “Let’s do that. Let’s hit those targets by regulation rather than by locking them in legislation.” Because—oh gosh—every time we change a piece of legislation we’ve got to go through the whole process. That is enormously expensive, enormously cumbersome. And quite frankly, why we don’t lump a whole lot of these pieces of small legislation together—that would be much more efficient. That would certainly reduce a lot of hot air.

The first thing that this bill does is to say instead of doing it through legislation, let’s do it through regulation, so it is a much more flexible, much quicker way of responding. Of course, different Governments may do that in different ways in terms of the regulatory process. So the standards and the process still exist. [Interruption] It’s wonderful seeing the byplay going across the House there. But anyway, I’ll carry on with it.

Look, over time we are quite clearly seeing the vehicle fleet, by and large, becoming more efficient. Obviously, we’ve had an uptake of electric vehicles: we’ve got plug-in hybrid vehicles, we’ve got more hybrid petrol vehicles as well. And the level of emissions from those, and the fuel efficiency of those, is coming down.

In fact, that is one of the reasons we’re having to look at changing the way in which the whole road transport system is funded. Because what’s been reliant on both the road-user charges and FED, the fuel excise duty, that level of charge, particularly the FED side, is starting to reduce. That is a problem for our ability to be able to fund transport generally, whether it’s public transport or maintaining and building our roads. So we need to change things there. Over time the intent is that we will get a more efficient vehicle fleet, and then, obviously, we’ve got to change the funding around it.

I just want to pick up on one other thing, which is what my colleague Mark Cameron was talking about, about choice. What is the part that the market plays in this? What we should be trying to do is to send the right signals in terms of the actual costs that apply: the costs of using the road, the weight of vehicles on the road and so on, the damage the vehicles do to the road—but also, the emissions side of things, and that’s why we have an emissions trading scheme, for example, whether that’s working efficiently or ineffectively. Then people can make their choice. They can say, “Well, an electric car may cost me more to buy in the first instance. But is it cheaper to run because it’s more efficient? Yes, maybe. Maybe I choose that; maybe I don’t.” And people have the ability to choose that depending on the circumstances and the needs that they have for their particular vehicle. That is called choice. That is called a market. We need to make sure that we do that because we can’t be forcing people to make particular choices.

I’m looking forward as the chair of the Transport and Infrastructure Committee to seeing this piece of legislation in front of us, the submissions that we get on it, and to making decisions on that and reporting that back to House in due course. I commend this bill to the House.

MARIAMENO KAPA-KINGI (Te Pāti Māori—Te Tai Tokerau): Kia ora tātou. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kia ora tātou e te Whare. I rise to speak for Te Pāti Māori on the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2). So here I am—here I go. This bill undermines our commitment to reducing climate change through the Clean Vehicle Standard. It does so by introducing more flexibility in meeting the targets, which, effectively, weakens the standard itself.

[Authorised reo Māori text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]

[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]

Specifically, the bill extends the lifespan of carbon dioxide emissions credits earned on low-emission vehicles from three years to four. It removes restrictions on transferring these credits between the new and used import sectors, and it allows borrowing of future carbon dioxide target overachievement beyond 2025. This subject itself isn’t one of one of my—you know, I don’t know this really well, but certainly listening to Julie Anne Genter and others, when I did spend a little bit of time with the Transport and Infrastructure Committee at times, I believe her, is the thing to say.

The Clean Car Standard limits the average carbon dioxide emissions from the tailpipes of new cars imported into Aotearoa. I’m sorry, I just heard a bit of muttering over to the left there; wasn’t sure what it was meant to do.

Arena Williams: Just muttering.

MARIAMENO KAPA-KINGI: Yes, yes, another bunch of mumbling, bumbling ideas. It was introduced to reduce emissions and prevent our country from becoming a dumping ground for inefficient vehicles rejected in other places with stricter environmental rules—worth noting.

Te Pāti Māori climate change policy is designed to incentivise low-income and rural farming, and that takes quite a bit, knowing that I come from Te Aupōuri and so on and they’re like, “How are we going to get a blinkin’ plug-in thing here, Meno?”, but let me tell you, the mood is changing. Our whānau are getting that this is a smart and good thing. So let’s just keep talking about this, making it happen, and making it work. So, to incentivise low-income and rural farmers to purchase electric and low-emission vehicles.

This bill, however, makes it harder to achieve these goals—thank you to those on the left. Climate change poses an existential threat not only to our environment but to our way of living and to our people and to our place and to our identity. So it just gets more grave the more I read on. Any legislation that prioritises short-term profits over long-term health of our taiao and of our environment harms our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. So be it on your heads, to those on the left. Modelling shows that by 2035, these changes could result in 39,000 fewer fully electric vehicles and 19,000 fewer plug-in hybrids on our roads. This is yet another piece of legislation pushed through by this Government to weaken environmental protections for short-term gain.

The Government often speaks of striking a balance, and I was listening to that bit of rhetoric earlier, but I don’t believe them, and I’m not convinced; it has very little merit, when I hear it from the left of the House, when we face already multiple once-in-a-lifetime extreme weather events every year. Obviously, I think of Whangaroa when I’m talking about that, I think of Whangārei, I think of Te Kaipara and those terrible moments which they talk about being once in a lifetime but, in fact, I think I’ve probably experienced about four or five lately. And still people deny; still Government is denying that these things are real and have serious and long-term impacts for our whānau on the ground every day. Even now, when you go through Kaeō and you go through Whangaroa and you go through the back road, it’s the decimation of properties, farms, roads, structures, infrastructure to a tiny little town reduced hugely by all of the flooding that happens not just once in a lifetime but far too often.

So there is absolutely no way that we would support this. We do not support it, we do not commend it, and we would ask that maybe change your mind. Let’s do that. Kia ora tātou.

DAN BIDOIS (National—Northcote): Good news for Labour and the Greens today. Statistics New Zealand figures just out show that emissions in New Zealand decreased to December last year by 1 percent—total greenhouse emissions. In 13 out of 16 regions in New Zealand it decreased. So despite the rhetoric from the other side, something is working in the coalition Government with respect to emissions. So on that basis, I look forward to welcoming the bill at select committee and I commend this bill to the House.

Dr CARLOS CHEUNG (National—Mt Roskill): For communities like Mt Roskill, home to many hard-working families, this bill matters. It supports our climate goals but also makes cleaner vehicles more accessible and affordable. By giving suppliers more flexibility, we reduce costs that would otherwise be passed on to the consumer. This means families in Mt Roskill can benefit from cleaner, cheaper-to-run cars without being priced out. It is a fair, smart, and future-focused policy. I commend this bill to the House.

ARENA WILLIAMS (Labour—Manurewa): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2). What a shame it is that we are here debating this bill, which will take us another step backwards away from New Zealand’s Paris Agreement targets. They are targets that this Government claims to still be honouring, and yet Government Ministers just yesterday in the House at question time were waving haere rā to Paris, haere rā to climate leadership, and haere rā to New Zealand’s place on the world stage as a nation that actually did its bit and gave young people around the world and young New Zealanders a fair go. [Interruption]

Who’s going to pay the cost of this, Mark Cameron? Who’s going to pay the cost of this, James Meager? I’ll tell you. The people who will pay the cost of bills like this—the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2), which is a tax break for industry—are the young New Zealanders who are going to pick up the bill for the remediations that we will need to pay as a nation going forward.

Do you know what this bill does? This bill lets some importers bank up their credits for as long as they like and sell them to other parts of their business or—it’s quite unclear yet, but we’ll get to the bottom of it in the select committee—others who would otherwise import dirty vehicles longer and more than they would have otherwise under a Labour Government. This bill puts dirtier cars on the road. This bill makes it harder for those people who want to transition to be able to do that. This bill is a sop to industry, who asked for it, and it doesn’t have any place in a Parliament that would pride itself on values-based and evidence-based policy to deal with climate change. This is a real shame.

There are two major areas that New Zealand should be focusing on in reducing its climate—

Mark Cameron: Oh, here we go.

ARENA WILLIAMS: —obligations, and Mark Cameron says, “Here we go.” He doesn’t want me to talk about the farmers, so I’ll give him the good answer that he’s after. Transport is one we all agree on. Transport is part of New Zealand’s economy where there are good wins to be made. I’ll tell you who said that: the Hon Simon Bridges, when he was the transport Minister.

Remember when the Key Government used to like electric vehicles (EVs)—when they used to point to electric cars as part of a transport solution which would actually make a difference to Aotearoa? They said, “Oh, buses—we’re not so keen on buses. Trains—we’re not so keen on trains. But EVs are coming, guys—just wait.” Well, now this is what’s coming: the next National Government, which walks that back. You can’t trust them.

You can’t trust them when they point to some techno solution. These guys are looking into the future and they’re casting around for something that will get us out of the hole without doing any of the heavy lifting, and then the next National Government comes around and says, “Oh well, it was all too hard, and industry has come with their hands out and we feel very sorry for these big car manufacturers, who have all these tax credits banked up that they can’t get the value out of. So we’re going to let them use those tax credits for money. That’ll be good—that’ll sort it out.” No, it won’t sort it out. It won’t help people buy cleaner cars, it won’t help reduce the footprint of the transport fleet in New Zealand, and it certainly won’t help future generations and young New Zealanders get themselves out of this mess.

Many of the MPs, in a few hours, will be meeting with groups of young people from the Aspiring Leaders Forum. They are here today in Parliament because they think about the future issues that affect our country. They have tried very hard to get into this programme and are proud to be here.

Dr Carlos Cheung: You are here to advocate for people in South Auckland.

ARENA WILLIAMS: Some of them are from the member Carlos Cheung’s electorate of Mt Roskill, and they believe in MPs like him to represent their generation for the future. What they are seeing from a debate like this is that this Government is happy to lump costs on to their generation and their children’s generations because they will not deal with the reality now, which is that we need standards, we need rules that are debated and set by this Parliament, where we are accountable to them.

You know, instead of having this debate in the future, we won’t actually have it in here at all, because it will be set by regulation, and Andy Foster stands up and he goes, “Oh, good, the bureaucrats can sort it out. Get that red tape out and wrap it all around these standards. Elected members shouldn’t be accountable when they are lumping costs on to future generations. Elected members should not be accountable to young people.” Well, I say to Mr Andy Foster that he is an excellent committee chair, but he is dead wrong on this issue.

Andy Foster: Oh, not at all—not at all.

ARENA WILLIAMS: Young people want you to advocate for them, Andy Foster. Young people deserve parliamentarians to come to this House and give it a go—to give them a fair go—that their generation wouldn’t be picking up the bill for short-sighted legislation like this.

Dr VANESSA WEENINK (National—Banks Peninsula): I’d just like to bring the energy in the room down a little bit; I think that’d be good. Because this is just another example from the other side of where they’re just yelling and screaming about something, when they’ve demonstrated that they’re not bothered to talk to industry about how things might actually work. We have listened to the way that pragmatic things need to be done. We have provided flexible options so that we can actually get more clean vehicles into this country. I commend the bill to the House.

The U.S. is the world’s largest oil and natural gas producer, but many of its best drilling locations have been tapped. While oil production is expected to plateau or fall in coming months, gas remains a bright spot for the industry thanks primarily to the country’s booming exports.

U.S. LNG exports are on track to soar from a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2024 to 21.5 bcfd in 2030, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) outlook. U.S. LNG producers are building new terminals to superchill gas to its liquid state for export. They aim to meet booming demand for the fuel worldwide to meet rising energy consumption and as many countries phase out coal-fired power plants.

That is providing robust growth prospects for the nation’s gas production regions. Morgan Stanley projects gas output in the Haynesville shale in Louisiana will soar by 41%, and in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico by 21% from 2024 to 2027. The Marcellus and Utica shales, which span parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, will grow by 9%, according to the Morgan Stanley estimates.

U.S. gas producers and investment firms are gearing up for more activity in Haynesville, positioning themselves for the boom in LNG exports boosted by new approvals from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Within a 300-mile radius of our (Haynesville) assets, there (are) more than 12 bcfd of LNG demand under construction to be in service by 2030,” Domenic Dell’Osso, CEO at Expand Energy, the nation’s biggest gas producer, told analysts in July.

Already this year, U.S. energy firm Venture Global LNG has sanctioned the construction of CP2, its third export plant in Louisiana; while rival Cheniere Energy decided to build two additional liquefaction trains at its Corpus Christi plant in Texas. Australian firm Woodside Energy Group said it would move forward with its Louisiana LNG project.

Analysts expect more energy firms to take advantage of Trump’s favorable federal permit policies to build additional LNG export plants and pipelines over the next 12 months.

TRAPPED GAS

Overall, the EIA projects U.S. gas output will climb from a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023 to around 113.5 bcfd in 2030, with most of that fuel going to meet soaring LNG export demand. Canada, meanwhile, will also supply an average of around 7.0 bcfd of pipeline gas to the U.S. over the next five years.

Even with LNG demand rising, the EIA projected total U.S. gas demand, including domestic consumption and exports, would only rise by around 1% per year on average from now through 2030, climbing from a record 111.5 bcfd in 2024 to about 120.3 bcfd in 2030.

That slowing growth comes as domestic gas consumption slides from a record 90.5 bcfd in 2024 to around 89.6 bcfd in 2030, due mainly to declines in the amount of gas that power generators burn as renewable output rises.

Some other energy analysts, however, expect U.S. power generators will burn more gas in coming years than the EIA forecasts to meet fast-growing demand for electricity from power-hungry data centers.

New pipelines and other infrastructure will be needed to transport the gas to market.

In the U.S. Northeast, capacity to transport gas will likely remain constrained, capping potential output growth there to just about 3 bcfd by the end of the decade unless more pipelines get built, according to East Daily Analytics analyst Jack Weixel.

In July, Western Maine Energy Storage filed for a preliminary permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a proposed development near the Central Maine Power transmission corridor. The project would be mostly in Dixfield, with a small portion in Canton, in Oxford County.

The FERC permit, which will secure the site for further studies including economic and environmental feasibility, is the first step in a permitting process that will take years.

Western Maine Energy Storage was established by the Pittsfield-based Cianbro Corporation in May 2024 to spearhead the “water battery,” shorthand for the two-reservoir system that involves pumping and storing water to meet the grid’s energy needs.

A primary goal of the project is to boost resilience by putting power onto the grid at times when other renewable resources, like wind and solar, aren’t generating electricity. A prime example of this is during evening hours after the sun has set, when energy demand, also known as the load curve, tends to peak.

“We all do appreciate the renewables on the grid, but they can’t always supply the energy electricity that we need. So a project of this nature will help stabilize that supply,” said Lauren Walsh, Cianbro’s corporate environmental manager.

The proposed 500 megawatt project would be the state’s first and only the fourth such energy development in New England. Two pumped storage hydropower plants have operated in Western Massachusetts for decades, and Connecticut has a smaller facility that’s been in operation since the late 1920s. There are a handful of such projects around the country, according to FERC data.

How does pumped storage hydropower work?

In order to function, pumped storage hydropower relies on differences in elevation in order for water to flow between two artificial reservoirs.

Oxford County’s topography makes the chosen location a match for the proposed development. Western Maine Energy Storage plans to build an upper and lower reservoir, each at 100 acres in size. The two reservoirs will be connected by a pipe. A powerhouse sitting just above the lower reservoir will generate electricity whenever water flows down from the upper reservoir and passes through a turbine. That electricity can then be passed onto the grid.

“When power is relatively cheap, you pump water up, and then when it gets really expensive, or there’s a lack of juice in the system, you flow it back down,” said Tom Brennan, director of public affairs with Western Maine Energy Storage.

Initially, the two reservoirs will be filled from the Androscoggin River in what Brennan described as a “sipping” process that will take anywhere from 10 months to a year. After that, both he and Walsh stressed that the site will function as a closed-loop project. Overland runoff and precipitation will make up for water that’s lost by evaporation.

Currently, the project timeline stretches into the early 2030s. Walsh said the goal is to begin construction in 2031, with the facility coming online in 2033, though that’s dependent on how quickly Western Maine Energy Storage can move through the permitting process with FERC.

Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers will also weigh in on the federal regulatory process, Walsh said. She also said that Maine DEP has already been contacted as they look to work through the environmental processes together.

From a grid reliability standpoint, Maine Renewable Energy Association’s executive director Eliza Donoghue said she is encouraged about what the project means for the state and addressing the grid’s ongoing affordability and reliability challenges. MREA is a trade association involved in advocacy at the state legislature and at the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

“There is no doubt that electricity demand across the country and including on our shared grid in ISO New England territory is going to go up significantly,” said Donoghue. Fossil fuels are one part of the affordability problem, as prices fluctuate depending on the global market.

Pumped storage hydropower, on the other hand, can help contribute to affordability, Donoghue said. Though she anticipates hard questions from stakeholders as Western Maine Energy Storage continues to engage with communities, she commended the project on its ingenuity in advancing Maine’s clean energy transition.

“What I’m hopeful for is that folks can see how reliable this technology is and how it can be a real problem solver,” Donoghue said.

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025.","NEVADA – Solar is set to account for half of new electricity added to the grid in the United States this year, according to predictions from the Energy Information Administration.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.

Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.

In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half.

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.

Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.

Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers.

Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.

On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”

A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation.

Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed.

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement.

One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.

“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote.

In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA.

While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.

Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.

Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA.

In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled.

If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/07/17135118/manny-becerra-ngdhrwax0j8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 19:02:03.189323

The next funding battle looms as Trump is directing a major federal crime crackdown in D.C.","The battle between top Republicans and Washington, D.C., could see another wrinkle next month, when Congress returns to a race against the clock to prevent a government shutdown by the end of September.

Local leaders said the last shutdown showdown left the District with a roughly $1 billion budget hole after Congress overrode its local spending plans. And the looming Sept. 30 funding deadline comes as tensions between Republicans and Democrats over the District have hit a fever pitch amid President Trump’s crackdown in the capital.

D.C. Council member Christina Henderson said Friday that local leaders remain in discussions with spending cardinals on Capitol Hill to prevent history from repeating itself.

“We are continuing our conversations with our appropriators and the four corners in Congress, because we know that sometimes the politics of the White House are very different from the politics of appropriators in terms of actually doing appropriations,” Henderson said.

D.C. was granted what’s known as “home rule” in the 1970s, but its budget is still approved by Congress.

Congress in March passed a GOP-crafted stopgap to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year, or late September, at mostly fiscal 2024 levels.

But unlike previous stopgap funding bills, the measure passed in March notably left out language allowing D.C. to spend its local budget — which consists mostly of funds from local tax dollars, fees and fines — at already approved 2025 levels.

As a result, D.C. officials said the District was forced to spend at its fiscal 2024 levels like federal agencies under the stopgap — despite running at its updated budget levels for roughly half a year.

At the time, top GOP appropriators said the long-standing provision was left out in error, despite some Democratic suspicions. But while the Senate quickly and unanimously approved a bill to remedy the issue, the House has yet to move on it almost six months later after hard-line conservatives pushed leadership to delay the measure while pressing for new “requirements” for the District to spend their local dollars.

Since then, House Republicans have led multiple efforts D.C. advocates have criticized as “anti-home rule,” including advancing legislation aimed at blocking non-U.S. citizens from voting in local D.C. elections. Some Republicans in Congress have even floated repealing home rule.

The next funding battle looms as Trump is directing a major federal crime crackdown in D.C. He has federalized the local police department, deployed more than 1,000 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital and instructed federal agents from the FBI; Drug Enforcement Agency; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and immigration enforcement to help patrol the streets.

Republicans are cheering his efforts and agitating for them to continue — even though data shared by city leaders shows crime had already been decreasing in recent years.

Trump has challenged those figures, however, and has accused the city of producing “fake crime numbers in order to create a false illusion of safety.” He also warned D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Friday to “immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen.”

That includes what Trump described on Truth Social as a “a complete and total federal takeover of the city.”

Trump signaled interest in wading further into the city’s operations, telling reporters on Friday that he plans to ask Congress to greenlight $2 billion for improvements in the District.

“We’re going to have this place beautified within a period of 12 months,” he said.

Richard Stern, director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, said he expects the growing clash between Trump and D.C. to take another turn.

Looking back on March’s shutdown fight, Stern said Friday that Congress’ “accidental” cut to the D.C. budget “generated an accidental test case.”

“I think what came out of it is Democrats walked away from it saying, ‘OK, we’re in a less strong position on this in public than we thought we were,’ and Republicans walked away from it saying, ‘We’re in a stronger position publicly than we thought we were,’” he said.

A YouGov survey released earlier this month found that almost half of Americans “strongly” or “somewhat” disapproved of D.C.’s police being put under federal control and National Guard troops being deployed in the city.

But a closer look found a sharp divide by party identification. Less than 10 percent of respondents identifying as Democrats approved of the move, compared with 26 percent of those who identified as independents.

Meanwhile, 74 percent of Republican-identifying respondents approved the recent actions by the administration.

“Everything since then has gone in congressional Republicans’ favor about, what’s going on with D.C. and people’s thoughts about it, all the way up to Trump deploying the National Guard, and that being popular enough, if not very popular among elected Republicans, let alone, the conservative base,” Stern said.

“Because of all that, I think that’s why this is on the table is a strong thing to Republicans in a push for.”

Despite what the District called a $1.13 billion cut to its previously approved budget authority, Bowser’s office said in May that it was able to prevent layoffs, furloughs and facility closures, while protecting dollars for “public safety and public education ecosystem.”

However, it has cited a number of measures it took as a result of the reduction, including a hiring freeze that cut back on “$63 million in personnel costs,” and it made “$175 million of non-personnel services reductions” and shifted more than $200 million in spending and costs for workforce investment and housing production from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026 and 2027.

“You don’t want to have the same situation happen again,” Henderson said Friday, “whereas, you know, you’re beating the city over the head talking about you’re not doing enough on public safety, and then you’re literally saying we can’t spend our money on the thing that you told us to fix.”

“That’s nonsensical, but crazier things have happened,” she added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/thunejohn_johnsonmike_082225gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-24 18:00:46.091211

Addressing the problem Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.
“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement.
“Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality.","Since the start of the Trump administration, federal officials have been rolling back funding to federal environmental programs and scientific research — moves that threaten to leave vulnerable communities with fewer resources to address air quality concerns. That reality, along with the desire to broaden its reach, prompted the Charlotte-based advocacy group CleanAIRE NC to launch a new interactive online tool designed to educate North Carolinians on environmental issues and provide them with resources for healthier communities.

“Air pollution is an invisible and often understated problem, yet its impact on public health is profound,” said Rafi Vaca, CleanAIRE NC education manager. “We created this platform to demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.”

Mounting research reveals ongoing threats to air quality in urban and rural settings, from vehicle emissions, industrial sources and agriculture. One recent study found that residents living near concentrated animal feeding operations face significantly higher exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5): Levels were 28 percent higher near large cattle operations and 11 percent higher near industrial hog farms compared with communities farther away.

CleanAIRE NC has responded to air quality issues by partnering with communities across the state — from Charlotte’s Historic West End to rural Sampson County — to establish local air-quality monitoring and provide training and educational support for residents most affected by pollution.

A sense of urgency

Particulate matter, or particle pollution, is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets in the air. Some, like dust, pollen or soot, are visible. Those usually fall in the range of PM10, particulate matter that is 10 micrometers, or about one-fifth the diameter of a human hair.

Other particles, such as PM2.5s, are so small they can only be seen with powerful microscopes, according to information provided by the EPA. Exposure to particle pollution can trigger serious health problems, including heart attacks, worsened asthma, reduced lung function and even premature death in people with heart or lung disease.

National studies echo air quality concerns raised by CleanAIRE NC. A 2022 report found higher risks of mortality across all age groups in U.S. regions with elevated PM2.5 levels — areas that often include vulnerable or low-income communities. The authors said the findings highlight the need for more equitable policies to improve air quality.

A 2018 study found that efforts to reduce PM2.5 levels in the U.S. from 1999 to 2013 resulted in a reduced mortality rate among elderly Americans, “worth $24 billion annually by the end of that period.”

Even as the Clean Air Act faces mounting challenges, environmental groups like CleanAIRE NC are working to bridge the gaps created by shifts in federal and state policy. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision redefined “Waters of the United States,” stripping federal protection from some wetlands. More recently, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to reevaluate the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health. Leaders of CleanAIRE say that together, these developments illustrate the importance of efforts like theirs to inform and empower communities.

Addressing the problem

Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.

“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement. “Growing concerns about our state’s readiness to handle potential environmental emergencies, coupled with recent legal changes, underscore the urgent need for informed community engagement. The CleanAIRE Academy offers a reliable, expert-backed source of information, with content developed by seasoned professionals in air quality, health, policy, advocacy and data science.”

“The CleanAIRE Academy greatly expanded my knowledge of air quality and advocacy,” said Naami Abbey, a student at the University of North CarolinaCharlotte, who described herself as “passionate” about environmental justice and community health.

Abbey was an early user.

“The self-paced courses made learning so much easier, deepening my understanding of air quality and how to turn concern into meaningful action for environmental justice,” she said.

How the academy works

The academy offers two learning modules. “Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality. The second, “Advocacy in Action,” helps participants “learn to navigate policy, craft compelling messages, and engage effectively with decision-makers.”

Four more modules are planned: “Air Pollution and Your Health,” “Environmental Justice,” “AirKeeper Dashboard” and “Community Science and Air Monitoring.”

“CleanAIRE NC has had a history of providing this type of environmental and air pollution education, starting with Atrium Health Network residents,” said Vaca, Clean AIRE’s education manager. “That was to connect environmental factors and pollution to support health outcomes, especially since this is often missing from traditional medical school curricula.""

Vaca said that the shift to online learning will help the organization meet growing demand. “We can’t always take on additional projects like in-person trainings, but the requests we receive from communities facing pollution and other environmental challenges keep growing. So we wanted to scale our work to support them, even if we didn’t have a dedicated grant for their community.”

Vaca expects the academy to expand as it gains traction, to reach beyond their usual partners to transportation agencies or corporations.

“It’s for the public and our impacted communities,” Vaca said. “Now we want to grow it and expand it so it covers a lot more topics.”

Drawing on experience

The idea for the academy originated in house with staff experts in 2024.

“Part of the reason it’s taken so long is because we are getting expert advice and going through a full review process to gather feedback and update these courses so they meet the highest standards,” Vaca said.

The potential audience of academy users includes residents of affected communities, academics, students and policy makers, Vaca said.

In terms of what Vaca hopes academy course enrollees gain from the experience, she said: “I hope our participants or students see that these topics don’t have to be boring or intimidating.

“The takeaway should be that hope and resilience come when we lean on our communities, when we educate ourselves and support the work that is already being done for a cleaner environment.”

The case is part of a growing climate litigation movement led in part by Indigenous youth.
Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate change litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change at Columbia Law, said lawsuits like this take on new salience in light of the Trump administration’s rollback of climate action.","On August 9 and 10, a massive storm over southeastern Wisconsin dropped up to 13 inches of rain in just a few hours, sending floodwater gushing downriver and destroying more than 1,800 homes in Milwaukee. The disaster was the second-worst two-day rain event in the United States since 1871.

“For years, scientists have warned about what can happen when climate change supercharges extreme weather events. This is exactly what they meant,” the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal reported, describing the disaster as a 1,000-year flood.

Now, more than a dozen youth from Wisconsin, including Indigenous youth, are filing a lawsuit against the state’s utility regulator to force it to consider climate change when evaluating new fossil fuel projects.

Currently, Wisconsin law blocks the Public Service Commission from taking air pollution — including carbon dioxide emissions — into consideration during the permitting process. Fifteen children and teenagers, ages 8 to 17, filed a lawsuit Friday against the utility regulator alleging that the law violates their constitutional rights to life and liberty.

The case is part of a growing climate litigation movement led in part by Indigenous youth. Twelve-year-old Miahlin B., who goes by her tribal name Waazakone, and her three siblings joined the lawsuit because climate change is eroding their traditional ways of life.

The children harvest wild rice, which is sacred to their communities, but warming temperatures are making it harder to grow rice successfully. They tap sugar maple trees to make maple sugar, but last year came up dry in part because of a shorter winter season. They fish for walleye and sturgeon, but both fish populations are shrinking as waters warm.

Waazakone told Grist she wants to protect her community for future generations. She describes herself as a water protector, explaining that caring for water is part of her responsibility as a female member of the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians.

“We need the government to understand that clean water and air is a human right and our most valuable resource,” she said.

The youth plaintiffs are also challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits the Public Service Commission from mandating more renewable energy from local utilities. Right now, about three-fourths of the state’s electricity generation comes from fossil fuels like oil and gas. That’s on par with the national average, but lags far behind states like South Dakota where more than 75 percent of its state energy production comes from renewables.

The plaintiffs are represented by Midwest Environmental Advocates, a Madison-based environmental nonprofit law center, and Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based nonprofit dedicated to advancing youth-led climate litigation.

The latter is perhaps best known for its successful litigation against the state of Montana in Held v. Montana. In December, the state’s Supreme Court affirmed that Montana youth have a constitutional right to “a clean and healthful environment,” and concluded that the state should take greenhouse gas emissions into account when considering new fossil fuel projects. The state hasn’t considered any new oil and gas projects since then, so it remains to be seen what that will look like in practice.

“Wisconsin doesnʻt have any fossil fuel extraction like Montana, but they do continue to have an electricity sector that’s dominated by fossil fuels. Itʻs the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state,” said Our Children’s Trust attorney Nate Bellinger, who is representing the Wisconsin plaintiffs.

The nonprofit has filed dozens of lawsuits in the U.S. over the last decade and a half, including one against the Trump administrationʻs reversal of President Joe Bidenʻs climate policies. Last year, they helped secure a landmark settlement in Hawaiʻi with the case Navahine v. Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, where youth plaintiffs contended that the state’s commitment to expanding infrastructure to support gas-powered cars and disregard for cleaner options violated their constitutional right to “a clean and healthful environment.” There, the state agreed to develop a plan to zero out carbon emissions from its transportation sector by 2045.

In Wisconsin, the constitutional right to a clean environment isn’t as explicit as in Montana or Hawai’i, where there is language in the state constitution spelling out that right. Wisconsin Democrats tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to add that language to the state constitution. But the attorneys in this new case are arguing that a stable climate system is necessary to achieve the constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate change litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change at Columbia Law, said lawsuits like this take on new salience in light of the Trump administration’s rollback of climate action. “It’s even more important to bring these cases now given the current state of the United States’ stance on climate change in general,” she said.

A spokesman from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission declined to comment on pending litigation.

As state leaders grapple with mounting costs of flood recovery and plead for federal assistance, Waazakone hopes that her lawsuit forces them to take climate change seriously.

The electronics sector stands out as a flagship success. Backed by the National Policy on Electronics 2019, the PLI scheme has propelled India into the global electronics value chain. Production in this sector surged by 146%, from ₹2.13 lakh crore in FY 2020-21 to ₹5.25 lakh crore in FY 2024-25, with major smartphone companies shifting production to India. This has transformed India into a leading mobile phone manufacturing hub, making technology more accessible and affordable under the Digital India initiative.

In the automobile and auto components sector, the scheme has attracted ₹67,690 crore in committed investments, with ₹14,043 crore realized by March 2024, creating over 28,884 jobs. Aligned with the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) initiative, the PLI scheme is positioning India as a global hub for electric vehicles and clean technology, supporting 19 categories of advanced automotive technology vehicles and 103 categories of components.

The pharmaceutical sector has also seen remarkable progress. Once reliant on imports for bulk drugs, India has flipped the script, moving from a ₹1,930 crore trade deficit in FY 2021-22 to a ₹2,280 crore surplus in FY 2024-25. Pharma sales under PLI have crossed ₹2.66 lakh crore, including ₹1.70 lakh crore in exports, with domestic value addition reaching 83.7% by March 2025.

In the renewable energy space, the PLI scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules is set to create 48 GW of fully integrated manufacturing capacity, reducing import dependence and bolstering energy security under the National Solar Mission. Investments of ₹48,120 crore have been committed, generating nearly 38,500 direct jobs as of June 2025.

The semiconductor sector is another success story. With six projects already underway and four new manufacturing units approved in Odisha, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh, the India Semiconductor Mission, backed by ₹76,000 crore, is driving India’s integration into global electronics value chains. These projects, with an additional ₹4,600 crore outlay, are expected to create over 2,034 skilled jobs and spur indirect employment.

Textiles, food processing, and white goods (ACs and LED lights) are also reaping benefits. The textiles sector, with a ₹10,683 crore outlay, has boosted man-made fibre exports to ₹525 crore and technical textile exports to ₹294 crore in FY 2024-25. The food processing sector, with 171 approved applications, has seen investments of ₹8,910 crore, complementing schemes like PM-FME and PMKSY. Meanwhile, the white goods sector is transitioning India from an assembly hub to a high-value manufacturing base, targeting 75-80% domestic value addition by 2028-29.

Beyond numbers, the PLI scheme is reshaping India’s industrial landscape by fostering sector-specific clusters, such as semiconductor parks in Gujarat and medical device parks in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. It is also catalyzing foreign direct investment and strengthening the MSME ecosystem by creating supplier and vendor networks around anchor units. The government’s increased budget allocations for 2025-26 signal a strong commitment to sustaining this momentum.

From reducing import dependency to boosting exports and creating jobs, the PLI scheme is more than a policy—it’s a catalyst for structural change. By aligning with national goals like Atmanirbhar Bharat and the $5 trillion economy vision, it is powering India’s industrial renaissance and cementing its place in global supply chains.",https://ddnews.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-08-24 23:00:28.173309

India boosts renewable energy equipment production. The government supports local manufacturing through PLI schemes and approved lists. New guidelines may increase wind power capacity and exports. Non-fossil fuels now comprise half of India's power generation. Experts see data centers and EVs driving clean energy demand. Technology advancements will determine the future energy mix.

The government is working on multiple fronts to support domestic manufacturing of renewable energy equipment for capacity addition as well as creating its domestic demand, renewable energy secretary Santosh Kumar Sarangi said.

Speaking at a panel discussion on 'Advancing India's Green Transition: Aligning Policy, Innovation and Industry for a Net-zero Future', moderated by ET's Shilpa Samant, Sarangi said apart from the production-linked incentives (PLI) schemes, which include solar cells, ingot-wafers and polysilicon, the renewable energy ministry has brought an approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) for modules and cells, and for wind power equipment.

The ministry is in talks with the industry for such a list for ingot-wafers. ""Once that comes, we will see some clear commitments on the part of the industry to set up ingot and wafer manufacturing in India and I am sure in course of time polysilicon as well is going to come on a big scale,"" Sarangi said.

JP Chalasani, CEO of Suzlon Group, said the new guidelines on wind power equipment manufacturing may help significantly increase domestic capacity even at sub-component levels. There's going to be a large capacity addition and a high probability of increase in exports, he said.

India has emerged as the world's fourth-largest in installed renewable energy capacity, with non-fossil fuel sources now making up half of its total installed power generation capacity.

Live Events

Vaishali Nigam Sinha, cofounder of ReNew, said all steps are in the right direction to get to 500 GW by 2030, which is an ambitious milestone. ""We are very optimistic and all stakeholders have achieved more than what was possible,"" she added.

Alternate demand centres

Reliable and consistent availability of renewable energy is likely to help meet the demand for data centres, industry experts said.

According to Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of public policy think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water, more options for offtake of clean energy such as data centres and electric vehicles are coming and it is not confined only to power distribution companies.

Vibha Dhawan, director general of policy research institute The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), said technology advancement is likely to determine the right energy mix in the future, with green hydrogen and/or nuclear energy expected to get into the mix.

Power will always be available if there is a demand, Suzlon's Chalasani said. To maintain grid stability and still have affordable power, it is important to have a combination of solar, wind and storage, he added.

""It will never be one versus another. What will happen depending upon the different load profiles of some states is that the combination might change,"" Chalasani said.

Sarangi said as far as demand from data centres and green hydrogen is concerned, there are technological solutions available today to provide them with renewable energy.

For immediate release

More than 50 organisations spanning the eastern seaboard have today issued an open letter to Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, urging the Federal Government to urgently fund a network of Local Energy Hubs across Australia.

From community groups to peak environment and industry bodies, the signatories are united in their call for a practical solution in rural and regional communities where renewable energy projects are being proposed or built, often without adequate information or support.

RE-Alliance, Community Power Agency and Yes2Renewables have been calling for the Federal Government to fund Local Energy Hubs across Australia, a proposed network of outreach centres staffed by locals to assist communities navigating renewable energy and transmission projects, while helping local households, businesses and farms to lower their energy bills and electrify.

Wendy Farmer from Voices of the Valley in Gippsland, Victoria, said: “Local Energy Hubs will build community trust in renewables, turning confusion into confidence and sparking community led change, making the energy shift work for everyone”.

In NSW, community group Good for the Gong has been urging local politicians to secure funding for Local Energy Hubs for the Wollongong region.

“Wollongong has huge potential to lead the energy transformation. It’s a windy place, with lots of local ventures already exploring ways to capture and store renewable energy. A Local Energy Hub would be a valuable resource for the community to access accurate and up-to-date information and make the most of the opportunities in renewable energy, from new jobs to cheaper, cleaner energy for households,” said Ali Gerritsen, spokesperson for Good for the Gong.

While 70% of people living in renewable energy zones support Australia’s shift to renewable energy, that support is highly conditional. The open letter argues that Local Energy Hubs are essential to building trust and unlocking the full benefits in the shift to renewables for regional communities.

“Australia has a real opportunity to be a global leader in renewable energy, and that starts with supporting the regions that are powering the country. That means ensuring communities have the guidance, information and support they need to navigate this energy transformation, and secure the benefits that will flow to workers, homes and businesses. Local Energy Hubs can provide that trusted, practical support to help our community with everything from household electrification - all the way to making the most out of the big projects,” said Justin Page, Hunter Jobs Alliance Coordinator.

The organisations warn that given the complexity of the change ahead, what happens in the next five years is critical. Without urgent government action to fund Local Energy Hubs, the shift to renewable energy will not happen at the speed and scale required, putting at risk both community support and Australia’s broader clean energy goals.

“We've been working in regional communities at the centre of Australia's shift to renewables for more than a decade, clearly articulating the case for Local Energy Hubs for more than two years,” said RE-Alliance National Director, Andrew Bray.

“We keep hearing the same thing: we need clear, trusted information and practical support and we can get that through the Local Energy Hubs model. Without it, the rollout of renewable energy will keep running into delays, cost blowouts and opposition. Everyone has a stake in getting this right.”

Prospective developers seeking to build stations in Wisconsin and share in the state’s federal grant have until Sept. 5 to submit their proposals, according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

Wisconsin was one of the first states to take part in the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) project, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

“Our state DOT was incredibly proactive” in participating in the program, Amy Barilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner.

The state’s allotment was $78 million and 53 projects were awarded with the funds in May 2024, a state DOT spokesperson said. The department signed 39 agreements accounting for $16 million before the program was frozen earlier this year; eight projects have been completed and five are under construction.

Countermanding the push to reduce reliance on fossil fuels that have been associated with worsening climate change, President Donald Trump issued executive orders promoting fossil fuels and attempting to block measures to promote renewable energy that were enacted during former President Joe Biden’s administration.

One of Trump’s first such orders, on the day he took office, froze NEVI funding that had not been committed to projects by then.

“It should have never been paused in the first place,” Barrilleaux said. “This was money that was allocated by Congress that was ours to spend under this program.”

Wisconsin, along with more than a dozen other states and the District of Columbia, sued to restore the NEVI grants. A federal judge in June blocked the Trump administration from freezing the grants or withholding the money from the 14 states and D.C. that joined the lawsuit.

Barrilleaux noted that by joining the lawsuit, Wisconsin was able to benefit from the ruling that released the money.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued new guidance for the grants Aug. 11. The new guidance eliminates various provisions in the original federal program, including specifications that emphasized using renewable energy, required consumer protections and required engagement with rural, underserved and disadvantaged communities.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy wrote in a statement.",https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4316-1024x768.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 20:00:32.200226

Argonne’s work benefits the U.S. nuclear industry at large.","In May, the United States took another step toward building the country’s first advanced nuclear reactors at an industrial site. The project at a chemical plant in southeast Texas includes four small modular reactors being developed with support from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Argonne National Laboratory.

Together with nuclear industry partners, Argonne scientists build on foundational knowledge to innovate new reactor concepts that are expected to be more flexible in site selection and scale and also less costly. These include reactors that could use recycled fuel, power remote communities or military bases, and generate less waste than current reactors to help meet the fast-paced energy needs an AI- and data-driven future demands.

Maryland-based reactor developer X-energy is one of several American companies that collaborate with Argonne to develop the next generation of nuclear energy systems. Its reactors will use a type of fuel called TRISO, a fuel highly resistant to melting down in a high-temperature reactor, which leads some to call it the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth.

The fuel is packed into billiard-ball-size ​“pebbles” that are fed into the reactor by the tens of thousands. Argonne scientists are providing detailed computational fluid dynamics simulations that describe all the pebbles in the reactor core. The research improves understanding of the fuel pebbles’ thermal efficiency and determines reactor efficiency and safety under different conditions. Additionally, Argonne studies the dynamics of water and vapor in the steam generator that will convert heat from the fuel pebbles into electricity.

With companies like California-based Oklo, Argonne explores ways to extract more power from used nuclear fuel, most of which has the potential to be recycled.

Oklo also used Argonne’s Mechanisms Engineering Test Loop facility and Thermal Hydraulic Experimental Test Article pool-type sodium facility to help validate reactor thermal hydraulic and safety analysis codes used in their license application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Companies such as Pennsylvania-based Westinghouse rely on Argonne’s suite of software and codes. These tools promote safety and fuel performance analysis in liquid-metal-cooled nuclear reactors, determine coolant flow and temperature distributions, and analyze neutronics and fuel cycle characteristics.

In work funded partly through DOE’s Office of Technology Commercialization, Westinghouse and Argonne use the WATTS platform to develop optimal design solutions for concepts used in Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor.

Argonne’s work benefits the U.S. nuclear industry at large. Other recent industry partnerships include ARC Clean Energy, Constellation Energy, Dominion Energy, Electric Power Research Institute, Exelon, Framatome, General Atomics, General Electric-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, HolosGen, Kairos Power, Moltex Energy, TerraPower, Terrestrial Energy and Westinghouse, among others. All of these partnerships seek to bring together the unique capabilities of private industry and the vast resources of a national laboratory to advance cutting-edge solutions to the nation’s nuclear energy needs.

Friday’s vote approved a merger between Piedmont Lithium and Sayona Mining, compensation to Piedmont Lithium’s executive officers, and a possible later special meeting.

The merger would create a nearly 50-50 equity holding split, with the new company being named Elevra Lithium.

The two companies already jointly own a North American Lithium project in Quebec. And Piedmont Lithium has plans to open a $1 billion mine in Gaston County.

The Charlotte Observer reports that the new company’s headquarters will be in Australia, with the U.S. headquarters in Belmont.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Support 50% renewable energy generation targets by 2030.

Establish bankable projects financed under EXIM Bank programs, reducing reliance on non-compliant imports.

Create local employment opportunities in engineering, manufacturing, and project execution.

Deliver secure, future-proof energy systems that align with U.S. and Saudi regulatory frameworks.

India's renewable energy sector is rapidly expanding, exceeding expectations for 2030 green goals, driven by solar and wind power growth. Executives highlighted skill gaps and payment risks as challenges, while emphasizing the need for hybrid projects and energy storage for reliable power.

India's power sector is transforming rapidly with the adoption of renewable energy, putting the country's 2030 green goals within easy reach, industry executives said at the event while flagging skill gaps and payment risks as key challenges. The panel discussion on 'Powering the Trillion-Dollar Energy Transition' was moderated by Devndra Chawla, MD & CEO, GreenCell Mobility.

No country other than China has expanded renewable energy generation capacity as rapidly as India in the past decade, Tata Power chief executive Praveer Sinha said, citing how the nation's solar power capacity has risen to 120 GW now from just 5 GW in 2015. ""While we say that we will do 280 GW of solar and 100 GW of wind (by 2030), I do believe that we have much better capability,"" he said.

Suzlon Group vice-chairman Girish Tanti said reaching 100 GW of wind power capacity by 2030 looks ""almost certain"".

Sinha stressed the importance of hybrid energy projects for round-the-clock supply. ""We already have successful combinations of solar and wind with battery and pumped hydro storage. The goal is to provide reliable power at lower tariffs and make Indian industry globally competitive,"" he said.

Live Events

Tanti also underlined the role of wind in balancing the national demand and supply of energy. ""Solar peaks in the day, but India's consumption peaks in the evening and morning. Only wind can balance that. Together with storage, we can ensure energy on demand,"" he said. India has a vast wind potential of 1.1 terawatt, of which only 4% has been harnessed, Tanti said.

The panellists also pointed to India's rapid progress in renewable energy equipment manufacturing. India's current capacity to produce wind energy equipment is 3-4 times its own annual requirement, making the nation an exporter of ""world class and cost-competitive"" wind gear, Tanti said. ""By 2030 it is expected that India will be supplying almost 10% of the global supply chain of wind and that could go as high as about $25 billion of earnings for our country,"" he added.

Experts on the panel also highlighted challenges facing the sector, ranging from skill shortages to the risk of delayed payments by power purchasers.

""In India, with a lot of distribution companies, the off-taker risk is still much high,"" said Vibhuti Garg, director-South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). ""To an extent, that has been addressed by SECI (Solar Energy Corporation of India) and NTPC tenders, which have come up with escrow accounts and payment security funds,"" she said, adding that tenders driven by states lack such risk-handling mechanisms.

Each gigawatt of wind power can generate 8,000-10,000 jobs, said PwC India chairperson Sanjeev Krishan. ""But only 30% of the workforce is job-ready for green roles. The huge focus has to be on skilling. We need structured renewable energy courses in colleges, maybe even start at schools,"" he said. Krishan also spoke about inclusivity. ""What better way to create inclusive growth than by bringing more women into the workforce,"" he said, citing the case of a women's self-help group in the Northeast, which maintains solar rooftops. Garg of IEEFA highlighted the role the private sector has played in the expansion of green energy by providing capital and investing rapidly.

Affordability helps drive EV adoption, which in turn creates a larger supply of batteries available for other uses once their days powering daily commutes and road trips are over.","Few things in the automotive industry are more predictable than the complaints from brand loyalists that a given new model “isn’t a real Porsche.” Because it built its reputation on eccentric rear-engine cars, Porsche has had to weather an unusual amount of this complaining, from when it first experimented with front-engine models like the 924, 944, and 928, to when it switched to water cooling, and of course when it launched the Cayenne SUV over two decades ago. But this time, the purists might have a point.

The Porsche Taycan showed that an electric vehicle could be imbued with the essential Porsche character, but while it was co-developed with Audi (which got the e-tron GT out of the deal), the Taycan was intended be sporty and to sell at a higher price point — putting it more in Porsche’s wheelhouse. That’s not the case with the Macan Electric, the first Porsche based on the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), the latest EV architecture from the Volkswagen Group.

Recommended Videos

Also a joint project between Porsche and Audi, PPE is intended for a wider variety of models to be sold in higher volumes than the J1 platform that underpins the Taycan and e-tron GT. So far that includes two Audi models and the Macan Electric, which is intended to replace Porsche’s bestselling gasoline model (it’s already done so in Europe, but the old gasoline Macan is still being sold in the U.S. for the time being). That gives Porsche less wiggle room for expensive bespoke engineering that could raise prices. So I was eager to get behind the wheel of a Macan Electric to see what’s really different from its PPE cousin, the Audi Q6 e-tron.

Looks like a Porsche, inside and out

With a base price about $15,000 higher than the Q6 e-tron, job one was to make the Macan Electric look like a Porsche, or at least something more expensive than an Audi. Brand-conscious shoppers who care mainly about the badge on the key fob will find plenty of recognizable Porsche styling cues, but thankfully the Macan also turned out to be a good-looking car. The mix of SUV proportions (the Q6 e-tron and Macan Electric are pretty much identical, dimensionally) and details like the Taycan’s rectangular headlights atop 911-style fender peaks shouldn’t work, but they give the Macan Electric an approachable, slightly goofy appearance like those older Porsche sports cars.

Inside, the Macan Electric’s interior is pure Porsche, and not just because the crest of the German city of Stuttgart is prominently placed on the steering wheel. The cabin actually feels like it was designed for driving, not selecting a new podcast while sitting in traffic. The dashboard is low and narrow, incorporating the requisite screens without obstructing visibility. The thin-rimmed steering wheel is a delight to use, and has an easy-to-reach drive-mode switch. You still get cupholders, but they’re out of the way so you won’t knock drinks over while reaching for controls.

This layout meant swapping Audi’s elaborate curved dashboard display for a more discreet 12.6-inch digital instrument cluster (shaped like the analog gauge clusters in older Porsches) and 10.9-inch central touchscreen (as in the Q6 e-tron, a front-passenger screen is also available). Porsche also uses an Android-based infotainment system with standard wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto like Audi but, again, the design choices are more driver-focused. Everything you need is in the instrument cluster which, unlike in Audi’s latest infotainment systems, still shows a map view. The main touchscreen might be further away from line of sight than in the Q6 e-tron, but it doesn’t matter.

Drives better, maintains charging performance

For the 2025 model year, Porsche is selling a single-motor rear-wheel drive Macan Electric base model, plus Macan 4, 4S, and Turbo models with dual-motor all-wheel drive. I had the Macan 4, a more basic model with no extras to compensate for any inherent weakness in the chassis tuning. This car didn’t have the optional rear-axle steering, for example, and with 382 horsepower (402 hp with temporary overboost) it was less powerful than a dual-motor Q6 e-tron, let alone the sportier SQ6 e-tron you could have for similar money.

Yet the Macan 4 Electric has the same factory-estimated zero to 60 mph time of 4.9 seconds as the Q6 e-tron, which is just a hint of what’s to come when you get behind the wheel. Perfectly-weighted and precise steering, air suspension that provided a comfortable ride while keeping the Macan Electric flat and drama-free in corners, and abundant grip made for an ideal premium-brand driving experience. The Macan Electric was fun to drive without rough edges, something that can’t be said of its Audi platform-mate. It’s hard to believe the two EVs were developed from the same parts bin.

That parts bin also provides the Macan Electric with an 800-volt electrical architecture, enabling 270-kilowatt DC fast charging that Porsche claims will get a 10%-80% charge done in 21 minutes. Starting at 25% battery capacity, the Macan was also able to recover 117 miles in 10 minutes of charging, making quick road-trip stops possible. That’s assuming you can find suitably powerful 350-kW fast chargers. Porsche will add Tesla Supercharger access in the near future, with adapters for the Macan’s Combined Charging Standard (CCS) port, but it anticipates slower charging at those ubiquitous stations. A standard 11-kW onboard AC charger can complete a full charge in 11.5 hours, according to Porsche.

All Macan models have a 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack (with 94 kWh of usable capacity) as the Q6 e-tron. The base rear-wheel drive model is rated at 315 miles, just six miles less than a rear-wheel drive Q6 e-tron, while the Macan 4’s 308-mile rating is just one mile less than the equivalent version of the Audi. Average energy consumption of 3.1 miles per kilowatt hour over a week of driving in mixed conditions was a good indication that these numbers will be achievable in the real world.

Worth the price?

Pricing starts at $79,995 for the rear-wheel drive base model, which is well above the Audi. The dual-motor Macan 4 bumps the price to $83,595, and because this is Porsche, a healthy list of optional extras left this test car with a $94,855 sticker price. This is at least a good place to stop though. The Macan 4S Electric and Macan Turbo Electric are faster, but range dips below 300 miles as the price goes up.

That the Macan 4 vastly improves on the driving dynamics of the Q6 e-tron while offering similar charging performance and efficiency makes for a great package. Those that simply want a prestige nameplate will find an EV that’s easy to live with, while those who buy into the Porsche mythos won’t be disappointed by the driving experience. If the Audi is drip coffee, this is a handcrafted cappuccino.

This week’s other EV news

There are plenty of expensive EVs, though, so the confirmation of pricing for the 2026 Nissan Leaf this week is especially newsworthy. The rebooted EV pioneer starts at $31,485 in 303-mile S+ trim, making it the lowest-priced new EV in the U.S. — and this isn’t even the cheapest version. Nissan will also offer an S spec, with pricing to be revealed at a later date, as well as a $35,275 SV+ model that undercuts the equivalent 2025 Leaf by $2,000 while offer more standard equipment, and a $40,485 Platinum version.

Affordability helps drive EV adoption, which in turn creates a larger supply of batteries available for other uses once their days powering daily commutes and road trips are over. Toyota has developed an energy-storage system that it’s now testing at Mazda’s main Japanese factory (Toyota owns a stake in the smaller automaker, and the two have collaborated on manufacturing and vehicle development).

In addition to the batteries themselves, this system repurposes energy management systems, allowing each pack to be controlled individually, and allowing for a mix of different configurations and chemistries to be used in one installation. Pending successful tests, Toyota and Mazda want to use this system as a buffer for the factory’s solar array, absorbing excess energy for later use when the sun isn’t shining.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_0590.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-08-24 16:01:03.163225

Coal plants generated only 15% of electricity in 2024, down from 19% in 2020 and 51% in 2001.
Coal plants and mines are usually decades old, they’re high polluters, and they’re not making profits.
Despite making up a minority of electric power generation, coal makes up more than half of all harmful climate emissions from the electric power industry.
In April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at revitalizing the production of coal by opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of coal plants across the country.","For a decade now, coal has been on the way out. The industry’s future was considered mainly dead and buried — until the administration of President Donald Trump decided to pull out every stop to dig it out of the grave. And this wasn’t caused by any Green New Deal boogeyman stuff: The coal industry does not have the economics to survive intense competition from less-expensive alternatives.

Trump’s efforts to revive coal will cost the U.S. time and money we can’t afford to waste, driving up energy costs for Americans and leaving the mining communities behind.

As we look toward the future, we should not be reaching backward for solutions to our energy supply.

Coal consumption for electricity has been in a steady decline since at least 2008 as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy sources gained a share of the supply. Coal plants generated only 15% of electricity in 2024, down from 19% in 2020 and 51% in 2001. Based on research from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, coal is expected to continue its steady decline for the remainder of the decade. The institute estimates that by 2030, 63% of the peak total of coal-fired capacity will be closed, and it’s possible that all remaining coal capacity still online at that point may be shuttered by 2040.

The arguments people made in the past about coal being economically profitable are no longer applicable. Coal plants and mines are usually decades old, they’re high polluters, and they’re not making profits. A study from Energy Innovation finds that 99% of coal plants are more expensive to run than to replace with new solar or wind energy and are getting more expensive to run by the day.

The median cost of new solar projects is $24 per megawatt-hour compared to a median marginal cost of $36 for the operations of existing coal plants.

What’s more, this is an industry that, on its way out, has prioritized taking care of its CEOs, not its workers. As major coal companies filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016, executives got massive compensation increases while workers were laid off and employee benefits were slashed. As profits shrank, executives paid themselves more, while miners paid the price.

This is all to say nothing of the public health consequences, environmental damage, and climate effects that coal mining and power production pose. Despite making up a minority of electric power generation, coal makes up more than half of all harmful climate emissions from the electric power industry.

Coal-fired power plants also have detrimental effects on public health: They were responsible for 460,000 deaths between 1999 and 2020, and they have estimated health costs up to $26 billion annually.

Even as the Trump administration has moved to block permits for wind and solar development and terminated federal clean-energy investments that were already underway, it has thrown every subsidy in the book to revive the dying coal industry. In April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at revitalizing the production of coal by opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of coal plants across the country. Later that month, he also added coal to his list of “critical minerals” and has used his “energy emergency” as an excuse to push through new mines.

Earlier this summer, Congress enacted a costly taxpayer subsidy for coal mining as part of its budget bill that cut health care and clean-energy investments. This attempt to prop up coal will come at the expense of people who have to pay higher electricity bills or question the reliability of their energy.

Coal’s decline was a problem of economics, and its revival only works if Americans are willing to pay more for less. By trying to bring back the coal industry, this administration is fighting the free markets that have shifted away from expensive and polluting coal plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner energy sources.

The Trump administration’s unwavering commitment to fossil fuels threatens to make energy costs higher for Americans while continuing to ignore solutions to energy independence.

The United States should let facts and economic realities take care of coal. What we need to focus on is affordable, abundant, and clean energy sources.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/15fffd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x800+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F46%2F46%2F80645c564a44b1b77c7cbb125c39%2F082525-op-dnt-sheatoon.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 16:01:43.771048

This includes permits from FERC and the Department of Energy, which strengthens its international appeal. In addition, companies such as JERA have also closed similar deals, increasing global interest in this strategic node.

For the execution of Phase 2, Sempra has entrusted Bechtel as the contractor responsible for design, procurement and construction. This alliance is intended to ensure the efficient delivery of the project, which is expected to start operations after the final investment decision scheduled for 2025.

Impact on the international gas market

This agreement represents a firm step towards the consolidation of U.S. LNG as a reliable source of energy for global markets. Both Sempra and ConocoPhillips agree on the importance of having a flexible and resilient supply network in a context of growing demand from allied economies.

Originally designed to expire in 2032, these credits can lead to substantial tax savings for taxpayers. These home energy tax credits were removed as a cost savings measure.

Clean vehicle credits are ending on 9/30/2025.

Residential Clean Energy Credit Ends 12/31/2025

To meet the requirements, you must install one of the following items in your main home or second home. Homes you rent out do not qualify, but renters who improve the property do qualify. The credit is 30% of the expenditure, including labor. The item must be brand new; used items do not count.

Specific Categories

Geothermal Heat Pumps

Wind Turbines

Solar Electric Panels

Solar Water Heaters

Fuel Cells (credit limited by the amount of kilowatt hours and only for main homes)

Battery Storage Systems (with equal to or greater than three kilowatt hours)

You can claim all of these in the same year if you qualify for them. There are no limits on the amount of credit you can claim, except for Fuel Cells as noted above.

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit Ends 12/31/2025

To qualify, you need to install or have installed one or more of the following items in a house that you live in that already exists. New homes do not qualify, nor do rental houses. The amount of the credit is 30% of the expense, with maximum limits listed below.

,American Energy,2025-08-24 18:04:04+00:00,The Cool Down,Energy firm unveils incredible project to turn 500 American rooftops into massive power plant,Jon Turi,,,,,https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/commercial-rooftop-solar-installation-solar-landscape/,"Solar technology firm SolarEdge and rooftop solar developer Solar Landscape are partnering to take advantage of a vast, untapped source of real estate: miles and miles of empty warehouse rooftops.
The projects are expected to be completed over the course of this year — just before federal tax incentives expire — and are said to mark America's largest rooftop solar installation to date.
According to REGlobal, rooftop solar installations have grown 10 times in size over the past decade, and there's plenty of room for further growth.
""We estimate that less than 5% of commercial and industrial roofs have solar on them,"" Shaun Keegan, chief executive of Solar Landscape, told the WSJ.
""One advantage of rooftop solar is that it's distributed, which can more easily support the grid in times of stress.","Solar technology firm SolarEdge and rooftop solar developer Solar Landscape are partnering to take advantage of a vast, untapped source of real estate: miles and miles of empty warehouse rooftops.

A recent Wall Street Journal exclusive announced this new collaboration, which aims to install 630 megawatts of solar capacity across more than 500 commercial and industrial rooftops across the U.S.

The projects are expected to be completed over the course of this year — just before federal tax incentives expire — and are said to mark America's largest rooftop solar installation to date.

""The U.S. is looking for more and more power. And this is one of the greatest ways to provide it. This is the quickest way to grid,"" Martin Rogers, U.S. general manager at SolarEdge, shared in the piece.

According to REGlobal, rooftop solar installations have grown 10 times in size over the past decade, and there's plenty of room for further growth.

It claimed that warehouses across the country have the potential to generate 185.6 terawatt-hours of solar-generated electricity annually, which could power 16% of all American homes, the report noted.

Solar power accounted for 69% of all new electricity-generating capacity in the U.S. during Q1 2025 and represented 10% year-over-year growth in the sector. However, this figure falls short of the average annual growth of 29% since 2015.

Solar Landscape's business model involves leasing rooftop space, developing and owning the solar system, and delivering energy back to the grid.

""We estimate that less than 5% of commercial and industrial roofs have solar on them,"" Shaun Keegan, chief executive of Solar Landscape, told the WSJ.

""It's a really underutilized area. We're talking million-square-foot warehouses — think 10 Walmarts put together,"" he noted, adding that ""leasing your roof can add 3% to 5% to the net operating income of a building.""

While Solar Landscape's projects can be tailored to offset the building's own energy costs, community solar is also part of their portfolio.

Nearby homeowners and renters can subscribe to get a part of these energy savings applied to their electricity bill without having to install their own system. These solar installations also improve the resilience of the local grid.

""One advantage of rooftop solar is that it's distributed, which can more easily support the grid in times of stress. Especially when combined with batteries that utilities can draw from,"" Joseph Osha, senior managing director and equity research analyst at Guggenheim Securities, told the outlet.

Households that prefer to add their own solar panel systems can bring their own electricity costs down to or near $0, although they should act quickly before the tax incentives expire on Dec. 31 of this year.

Free services like EnergySage can help interested consumers compare quotes from vetted installers and save up to $10,000 on their project.

An added benefit from having solar panels for your home is that it makes other money-saving electric appliances, such as heat pumps, more affordable to run.

Mitsubishi also offers a service that can help consumers find the best and affordable model for your specific needs.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rooftop-solarimage-recs1Y2ZTlcNtUQRH.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 17:00:38.043678

The company’s ambitious $10 billion data center project in Richland Parish, announced late last year, promises to transform this rural enclave into a high-tech hub. But as construction hums along on a site spanning over 2,000 acres, the initiative is sparking debates about energy demands, economic trade-offs and the broader implications for America’s power grid.

Meta’s facility, slated for completion by 2030, is designed specifically for AI workloads, including training advanced models like its open-source Llama series. According to a detailed analysis in Fortune, the project requires an staggering 2 gigawatts of power—enough to supply electricity to about 1.6 million homes, rivaling the consumption of an entire state like Georgia. This voracious appetite for energy underscores a growing trend: Tech giants are fueling AI’s ascent with massive infrastructure builds that strain existing utilities and necessitate new power sources.

The Power Puzzle: Balancing AI Ambitions with Grid Realities

To meet these needs, Louisiana regulators recently approved a contentious energy plan from Entergy Louisiana, which includes $3 billion in investments for gas-fired plants, solar expansions and transmission upgrades. As reported by NOLA.com, the data center alone could consume three times the annual electricity of New Orleans, boosting Entergy’s statewide demand by 30%. Critics, including environmental groups, argue this reliance on fossil fuels could exacerbate climate challenges, while proponents highlight the plan’s inclusion of renewables as a step toward sustainability.

Yet, the approval process wasn’t without friction. Advocacy organizations disputed the arrangement, fearing higher power bills for residents. A piece in 404 Media described the facility as a “black hole of energy use,” with secretive details about consumer impacts fueling local anxiety. Posts on X from users in the region echo this sentiment, with some expressing concerns over rising costs and environmental strain amid the AI boom.

Economic Ripple Effects: Jobs Boom Meets Community Upheaval

On the economic front, the project is a windfall for Richland Parish, a community of fewer than 20,000 where poverty rates hover above the national average. Governor Jeff Landry hailed it as “a new chapter” for Louisiana, noting it’s the state’s largest private capital investment ever. Coverage from AP News details how construction has already created thousands of jobs, revitalizing local businesses from diners to hardware stores. Meta projects hundreds of permanent positions once operational, focusing on AI optimization and data management.

However, this influx isn’t without downsides. Longtime residents report skyrocketing housing prices and traffic congestion, altering the area’s pastoral charm. As CNBC explored, Louisiana offered substantial incentives—including tax breaks and infrastructure support—to lure Meta, raising questions about long-term value. Will the jobs offset the environmental and fiscal costs? Industry insiders point to similar builds in Texas and elsewhere, where AI-driven data centers demand up to 1.4 gigawatts, setting benchmarks for a $25 billion investment wave.

Broader Implications: AI’s Thirst for Resources Reshapes Rural America

This Louisiana endeavor exemplifies a national shift, where AI’s computational hunger is prompting a rethinking of energy infrastructure. A commentary in The Georgia Star News warns of “promise and peril,” noting how such projects could strain water and power resources in underserved areas. Meta’s move, as per posts on X from tech watchers, positions Louisiana as a template for grid expansions nationwide, potentially accelerating fossil fuel use even as clean energy goals loom.

For industry leaders, the stakes are high: Success here could validate massive AI investments, but failures in energy management might invite regulatory scrutiny. As one X user noted in discussions around the project’s scale, the data center’s power draw rivals major urban centers, highlighting AI’s role in reshaping not just technology, but the very fabric of rural economies and national energy policy. With construction advancing rapidly, Richland Parish stands at the forefront of this transformation, a microcosm of the tensions between innovation and sustainability.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-2150983e-1031-455b-a7eb-0f7a4381649c.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 15:05:35.987006

Numerous servile commentators in Russia repeat the thesis that Trump needs a peace deal now more than Putin.","US President Donald Trump let more deadlines to impose crushing sanctions and tariffs on Russia to end the war in Ukraine slide yet again. The reason might be that he is still hoping to sign off on multi-billion-dollar business deals with the Kremlin.

The latest was an August 8 deadline to halt hostilities or face 100% duties and secondary sanctions on Russia crude oil customers if Russian President Vladimir Putin did not call a ceasefire. But that deadline was abandoned after the Kremlin agreed to the Alaska summit on August 15. India did get an additional 25% of duties for trading with Russia, but China, the other major purchaser of Russian crude, was given a stay of execution until November. Trump has since threatened to return to the sanctions idea, but at the weekend, he was giving the Kremlin another two weeks of time, pushing the new deadline into the middle of September.

During the various rounds of talks, most of the comments coming out of the meetings have pertained to POW swaps and the potential for a ceasefire, but in the background it has been clear there is a parallel track of unvocalised talks about business. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the very start of the process in Riyadh in February that there was a “historic opportunity” to do business with Russia, a sentiment echoed by Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, who has participated in all the meetings and said in Riyadh that he was leading a “parallel track” of negotiations with America on doing deals.

ExxonMobil invited back to Sakhalin

Putin has alluded to restarting commercial relations on several occasions. He has ordered the government to draw up rules for international companies that want to return to the Russian market. He also offered Trump to launch joint ventures to exploit Russia’s vast reserves of critical minerals and rare earth metals (REMs), as well as suggesting the US invest in Russia’s development of the huge oil and gas deposits in the Arctic. Likewise, ahead of the Alaska summit Trump suggested that Russia and the US jointly develop the mineral deposits in Alaska.

Now things have taken a concrete step forward. Putin signed a decree allowing ExxonMobil to potentially return to the Sakhalin-1 oil project, opening the door for renewed US-Russia energy cooperation days before the start of the Alaska summit on August 15. ExxonMobil pulled off the project shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, booking hundreds of millions of dollars of losses as a result.

The decree could enable ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, to re-enter the venture as a shareholder with a 30% stake. While Sakhalin-1 is not subject to formal Western sanctions, ExxonMobil pulled out and its stake was subsequently transferred to a Russian operator, as the company made no public effort to retain its interest.

Moscow and Washington are now in talks over potential cooperation on natural gas projects in both Russia’s Arctic zone and the US state of Alaska, according to Putin.

Restarting cooperation with the US is also key for developing Russia’s LNG business in the Arctic, led by privately owned firm Novatek. The company has built a liquification plant and is actively exporting LNG, but its Arctic LNG-2 expansion has been stymied by sanctions that prevent it buying critical technology, almost exclusively made by US companies. Speaking at a meeting with nuclear industry workers in Sarov on August 23, Putin highlighted the growing role of Russian energy companies in LNG.

“We have several companies, namely the Novatek company, which is one of our big companies working in the field of natural gas liquefaction,” he said.

Putin stressed that Novatek already works “in cooperation with many partners, both European and Asian ones,” and suggested the scope for expanding such collaboration across the Atlantic. “By the way, we are discussing with our American partners the possibility of working together in this field, not only in our Arctic zone but also in Alaska,” the president added.

The Russian leader underlined that Moscow possesses advanced capabilities in LNG production that could attract interest abroad, without adding that attempts to replace US technology with Chinese analogues has proven a miserable failure.

“Russia currently has unique technologies in this field, which are of interest to Russian partners, including in the United States,” he noted.

Pointing to longer-term prospects, Putin said: “The Arctic zone, the Northern Sea Route and your work there have great prospects, and they are developing at a very good pace.”

The meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Alaska made possible not only the prospect of a peace agreement on Ukraine, but also the possibility of easing sanctions pressure on Russia. So far, Trump has largely backed Putin’s demands, both in the seven-point “final offer” peace plan in April that also contained demands for significant sanctions relief for Russia – a demand the European partners balked at – and a very similar list of demands Trump demanded from Ukraine following the Alaska meeting this month.

Trump's sanctions policy and Russian wishes

The Trump administration has been extremely aggressive even with its nominal closest allies like Canada and the EU, but pointedly has left Russia almost entirely alone. Since he took office, Trump has effectively cut all military and financial support for Ukraine and imposed no new sanctions on Russia whatsoever. During the Liberation Day duties announcements, Russia was almost unique in that it received duties of 0%, whereas the least anyone else got was 10%.

Trump talks tough on Russia, but has repeatedly failed to follow through with action. He said in January, March, and May of this year that he was ready to introduce tough sanctions against Russia, but his administration has yet to introduce any significant restrictions. In July, Trump gave Russia an ultimatum, first for 50 days, then shortening it to ten, threatening to introduce prohibitive duties on goods from countries that buy Russian oil. However, nothing has happened.

After the meeting in Alaska, in response to a question about sanctions on an evening program on Fox News on August 21, Trump said: ""We don't have to think about it yet."" And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is considered the main anti-Russian hawk in the White House, in several interviews over the past week effectively called sanctions an obstacle to concluding a peace treaty and made it clear that the administration will wait with restrictions until there is no hope for peace.

The discussion of new sanctions may resume in September, when the Senate returns from summer recess. “If things don’t move in the right direction before we get back to work, I think we’ll have to go to Plan B,” the sponsor of a previous bill to impose 500% duties on Russia’s trading allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, told AP last week. But Graham, one of the senators closest to Trump, has always stressed that the bill must first be approved by the president. The Senate returns from recess in the first week of September.

This approach gives the Kremlin an obvious strategy, Alexander Kolyandr, a visiting research fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), wrote in The Bell: drag out the negotiations as long as possible, not agreeing to anything for a long time, and continue both the dialogue with the White House and the military assault in Ukraine. Numerous servile commentators in Russia repeat the thesis that Trump needs a peace deal now more than Putin. If this is a reflection of the Kremlin’s views, then at some point it may begin to demand a relaxation of the sanctions regime in order to continue negotiations.

The official Russian position on sanctions remains maximalist — all restrictions are illegal and must be lifted. The real minimum acceptable option, as sources in Moscow told The Bell, consists of three main parts: lifting restrictions on oil exports, allowing at least one major state bank to open correspondent accounts in the US to facilitate cross-border payments, and opening up exports of aircraft, aircraft parts, and some other industrial equipment.

Will foreign investors return to Russia if sanctions are lifted? Following the default of 1998 western investors were so badly burnt that it took nearly five years for the stock market to recover to where it was just before the default and devaluation of that year.

Mooney-Bullock says she hopes their findings can help households across the country reduce their energy bills and consumption.

“As we seek to move forward with lower energy use and green sources of energy — not just for the folks who can afford solar panels on their houses, but people who are living in all types of housing — we knew it was really important information that we wanted to be able to continue to study,” Mooney-Bullock said.

Where you live has significant impact on your health.

Rebuilding Together, a nonprofit that repairs homes at no cost, has launched Home Sick, an initiative which addresses health concerns related to housing conditions.

“Our program is really about people who just want to be able to stay in their community, in their home, and maintain that when it’s increasingly out of reach financially, particularly with higher property taxes,” said executive director of Rebuilding Together Greater Charlotte, Beth Morrison.

Many people served by Rebuilding Together are often Black women above the age of 60, with an average income of $30,000 a year. The average cost of a home repair is $25,000.

One of their initiatives, Building a Healthy Neighborhood, has made adjustment in areas with concentrations of homes needing more repairs, like Pottstown in Huntersville and Hidden Valley in Charlotte. In some cases, community leaders have reached out to Rebuilding Together for partnership.

These are areas that are being targeted by rapid investment in previously disinvested neighborhoods, creating the threat of code enforcement violations. Morrison said lots of people tend to be suspicious about costly repairs being done on their homes for no cost, especially when government is involved.

Older houses, particularly those built before 1978, may have a higher risk of having lead paint, asbestos, older HVAC systems that require pricy upgrades, which are threatening to the health of young children and pregnant people. The average repair for an HVAC system, Morrison said, is around $10,000.

Morrison said that about 40% of juvenile asthma cases are caused by the home they live in. One of the major repairs Rebuilding Together does is replacing old carpeting which has trapped years of dust and pet dander with vinyl planks.

“Environmental triggers in the home for respiratory illness, like people smoking in the home; pest infestations are a major one, having good air quality control, having a good HVC system and changing your air filters often,” Morrison said.

As homeowners age, mobility and accessibility needs can change, said Beth Morrison, Rebuilding Together’s director. Additions like walk-in showers, safety bars, wheelchair ramps, and levers for door handles can make homes more accessible.

“Just think about wanting to bathe yourself independently,” she said. “Many people can’t do that without a costly home health aide, or a family member having to help them physically get in and out of the bathtub.”

Widening doorways, adding lighting, and bathroom modifications are also a part of their work.

“There’s a lot of ways that somebody’s environment is more challenging because of their own health and mobility, but there re sometimes when the home is actually making them sick,” Morrison said.

Rebuilding Together, a licensed general contractor with repair, renovation and painting certification from the Environmental Protection Agency, is taking applications for projects in the Hampshire Hills and Eastwood Acres neighborhoods. The nonprofit partners with donors like Bank of America, Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, LG, Foundation for the Carolinas, as well as Mecklenburg County and city of Charlotte.

Morrison says the city and the county have been “laser-focused” on working with Rebuilding Together to preserve the stock of older, more affordable homes. Beginning in September, the organization will launch basic home maintenance workshops for homeowners to know about things to look out for before they become more serious and expensive home improvement projects.

In the future, Rebuilding Together is looking into ways to improve rental properties without giving capital to “slumlords,” Morrison said. The need for repairs coupled with higher costs may cause homeowners to lose housing that has been in their family for generations, robbing them of the opportunity to pass along wealth. In this way, Morrison said Rebuilding Together is also homelessness prevention.

“The most affordable home is the home somebody already lives in,” she said. “So, if we can work to preserve existing affordable housing stock by making these investments so that they can live in their homes longer, it’s lessening the burden on how many new units we need to build as community.…

“We could repair maybe 10 to 15 homes for the price of building a new home, and that’s for major repairs.”

With 539 active rigs as of August 22, 2025, the industry faces a stark reality: exploration and production (E&P) firms are outperforming energy equipment and services (EES) players in a low-rig environment. This divergence highlights a critical inflection point for investors, where strategic positioning between resilient E&P operators and vulnerable EES providers could determine long-term returns.

The E&P Resilience Play

Despite the 15-week rig decline, E&P companies are defying expectations. Natural gas production hit a record 106.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in August 2025, driven by efficiency gains and disciplined inventory management. Producers like Coterra Energy and CNX Resources have leveraged reduced drilled-but-uncompleted (DUC) well inventories to boost output without increasing rig counts. For example, Appalachia's DUCs dropped by 60 from January to July, while Haynesville producers cut 25 DUCs in the same period. These optimizations have allowed E&Ps to maintain production growth even as rigs decline.

The key to E&P resilience lies in their ability to prioritize capital discipline. Companies such as Expand Energy and National Fuel Gas have raised production guidance for 2026, citing improved well performance and cost controls. This focus on efficiency—rather than sheer rig count—has enabled E&Ps to navigate weak commodity prices. For instance, Texas's oil rig count fell 65% from 2014 to 2024, yet production rose 94%, thanks to advancements in horizontal drilling and fracking.

The EES Vulnerability

Conversely, EES firms are struggling to adapt to the prolonged rig decline. With U.S. oil rigs down 46 from the same period in 2024 and gas rigs facing similar pressures, demand for drilling services has plummeted. Companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger are seeing reduced contract volumes, particularly in the Permian Basin, where rig counts have fallen to 251 as of August 2025—the lowest since 2021.

The EES sector's reliance on cyclical rig activity makes it inherently vulnerable in a low-demand environment. While E&P firms can pivot to optimize existing assets, EES providers lack the flexibility to offset declining rig counts. This is evident in the sector's underperformance relative to E&Ps, as illustrated by the stark contrast in stock price trajectories over the past three years.

Strategic Investment Insights

For investors, the energy sector's rebalancing presents a clear opportunity: lean into E&P firms with strong balance sheets and operational efficiency, while approaching EES providers with caution. Here's how to position a portfolio:

Prioritize E&P Resilience:

Target companies with low DUC inventories and high well productivity, such as Coterra Energy (CTRA) and Expand Energy (XEC).

Favor firms with robust shareholder return programs, like National Fuel Gas (NFG), which has raised dividends and production guidance.

Monitor E&P guidance updates for 2026, as companies like CNX Resources (CNX) demonstrate confidence in growth despite rig declines.

Avoid EES Overexposure:

EES firms remain at risk until rig counts stabilize. However, consider selective plays in niche areas like digital oilfield services, where demand for efficiency tools is rising.

Watch for EES companies with diversified revenue streams or strong cash reserves to weather the downturn.

Leverage Sector Rotation:

Use the E&P-EES divergence to hedge portfolios. For every EES holding, balance with a high-margin E&P play.

Reallocate capital to E&Ps that are outperforming in production growth while maintaining disciplined capital expenditures.

The Road Ahead

The U.S. rig count's 15-week decline underscores a structural shift in the energy sector. E&P firms are proving that production growth is achievable through efficiency, not just scale. Meanwhile, EES players face a prolonged period of adjustment. For investors, the lesson is clear: align with the winners of this rebalancing—companies that turn constraints into competitive advantages.

As the EIA forecasts continued rig count declines into 2026, the energy sector's next chapter will be defined by those who adapt.

Last Updated on:

There they go again. The clown car that used to be known as the US government has brought its oversized shoes down upon the US offshore wind industry once again. This time the victim is the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, brought to a screeching halt by order of the Interior Department even though it is already 80% complete. Connecticut is also impacted because it is a partner in the project. And, once again, a proposed multistate gas pipeline is lurking in the background.

Nice Offshore Wind Project You Have There …

The Revolution stop-work order takes note of unspecified security concerns, which sounds rather mysterious if not downright sketchy. For some insights into the reasons for taking such an extreme measure, let’s take a quick look at the stop-work order that froze the Empire Wind project in New York State earlier this year. Empire is a project of the Norwegian diversified energy firm Equinor, and work was already well underway when the Interior Department brought the hammer down in April.

The freeze was a temporary one. According to multiple reports, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul struck a bargain with the White House, and the proposed Constitution gas pipeline was among the bargaining chips. Equinor’s status as a leading US oil and gas producer may have also factored into the de-freeze. As of this writing, work on Empire Wind is proceeding apace.

As for the Constitution pipeline, it was first proposed by the firm Williams in 2014 with the aim of bringing gas from Pennsylvania into New York State, to connect with offtakers in New England. State environmental officials redlighted the project in 2016, but Williams hung in there for a few more years before officially dropping the proposal in 2020. Now, suddenly, here it comes again, magically brought back to life.

Williams has other projects in the works throughout the US, and the benefits of the new pipeline to consumers in New England are unclear. However, for reasons best known only to Williams, the Constitution pipeline is reportedly on the fast track to approval.

… Shame If Anything Should Happen To It …

The Revolution Wind stop-work order could be a temporary one as well. Though, that remains to be seen. Its developer, the Danish firm Ørsted, does not have US oil and gas investments to bargain with.

However, there is a pipeline involved, and that’s where the Trump administration could apply some pressure on state officials in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

The pipeline in question is Project Maple. It comes under the umbrella of the Canadian firm Enbridge. As described in a letter of opposition signed by dozens of environmental groups and community organizations in the region, Project Maple is a rebrand of the former Access Northeast project, in which Enbridge proposed another in a series of expansions on its existing, 1,100-mile Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline from Pennsylvania to points east.

Enbridge mothballed Access Northeast back in 2017, but the project found its legs again in the form of Project Maple, shortly after the results rolled in from the 2024 Presidential election cycle.

“Enbridge wants to expand its 1,100-mile-long natural gas pipeline system, the Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline,” the Conservation Law Foundation noted in an update on April 18.

“This system runs from New Jersey through New York and into Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts,” CLF elaborated. “While the details are vague because this proposal is still in its early stages, we do know that Enbridge wants to replace existing pipelines, add new secondary pipelines, and expand compressor stations throughout the system’s route.”

The Tangled Web Of US Pipelines

If you have reason to believe that Project Maple is the end game of the Revolution Wind stop-work order, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, though, consider that Enbridge is a Canadian company. Relations between the Trump administration and Canadian companies have become rather frayed of late, to put it mildly.

Be that as it may, Pennsylvania is the nation’s second-largest producer of natural gas, and US-based gas producers that operate in Pennsylvania have an interest in seeing Project Maple spread its branches.

Besides, Enbridge is a pipeline owner and operator, not a construction firm. When Enbridge sets pipeline work in motion, the hands-on tasks are handled by the pipeline construction people, and that’s where things get interesting. Take a look over at Michigan, for example, where Enbridge seeks to replace its Line 5 oil and gas pipeline. The contractor on the project is the firm Barnard Construction, which is known for its billion-dollar work on Trump’s border wall. The Guardian is among the news organizations to pick up the Line 5 thread earlier this year.

“Donald Trump’s administration is being accused by activists of a quid pro quo as it attempts to fast-track a controversial fossil fuel pipeline proposal in Michigan that would in part be built by a donor with deep financial ties to the president,” The Guardian noted in March, adding that “the contractor is Tim Barnard, who, along with his wife, gave $1m to Trump’s campaign last year.”

Of course, this doesn’t mean that similar monkey business is afoot at Project Maple. It simply means that Enbridge does not appear to have suffered any political fallout from the hostilities sparked by the Trump administration’s tariff wars, at least for the time being.

Next Steps For The US Offshore Wind Industry

As for the US offshore wind industry, practically every state on the Eastern seaboard from Maine down to North Carolina has been banking on offshore wind to meet climate goals, stabilize fuel costs, and reduce their dependence on oil and gas shipped in from points west.

Now the whole industry is in jeopardy as the Trump administration puts the squeeze on the entire federal offshore lease program at one end, while monkey-wrenching Revolution Wind and other projects that have already started construction. States in “real America” are feeling the pain as well. Offshore wind advocates like to point out that offshore wind farms are vast, complicated infrastructure projects that create thousands of manufacturing jobs all over the US as well as portside jobs in their home states.

The deep red state of Louisiana, for example, lent its offshore oil and gas expertise to construct the nation’s very first offshore wind farm in the US almost 10 years ago, and Louisiana businesses continued to make major contributions to the industry on through this year.

Whelp, kiss that goodbye. It was only last year that Ørsted and the Louisiana shipbuilder Edison Chouest Offshore celebrated the launch of the first purpose-built offshore wind construction vessel made in the USA, the ECO Edison. That could be the last one Edison ever builds for the US market.

Meanwhile, Ørsted has complied with the stop-work order and is examining its options.

The idea isn’t new; Experts have warned that the U.S. power grid could face critical stress in the future. The idea isn’t new. An 1956 report stated the country’s electricity infrastructure was being pushed to its limits. At the time, it was mostly theoretical—a cautionary tale for engineers and policymakers. However, the warning stayed within the industry, quietly shaping how energy systems were built.

Past concern in a new format: Technology is consuming energy

Recently, that concern has gained new urgency. America’s demand for electricity is bigger than ever, and the grid is facing pressures that weren’t anticipated decades ago. High consumption is changing industrial needs and how engineers operate – as well as the rapid adoption of emerging technologies, which are all converging. The question is no longer if strain will occur—it’s what will happen when it does. It’s just a matter of time now.

Across key regions, energy planners and utility companies are closely tracking the situation. New infrastructure projects, operational decisions, and energy strategies are all being reconsidered in real-time. And soon, what has been theoretical for nearly 70 years could manifest in a way the country hasn’t seen before.

Are data centers destroying the energy grid in the U.S.?

Tech companies are selling a future where AI tells you what to do on a daily basis. What to wear, where to go, and how to spend your free time. Meanwhile, the cost of all that processing power is finally hitting consumers, as electricity prices rise across the country while the grid struggles to handle the surge in demand.

According to Newsweek, energy use from data centers contributed to a 6.5% increase in electricity prices from May 2024 to May 2025. Some states saw far higher jumps: Connecticut and Maine reported 18.4% and 36.3% increases, respectively. And as tech companies expand their AI infrastructure, those numbers are expected to climb even higher.

Utilities are trying to keep up by relying on old fossil fuel plants, but the solution is far from simple. Dominion Energy, which serves much of Virginia, has asked regulators to make large consumers of electricity cover a bigger share of the cost for upgrading the grid. Without changes, electricity prices in some parts of Virginia could rise by as much as 25% by 2030.

Artificial Intelligence might not be the solution

Improving AI efficiency isn’t likely to solve the problem, either. AI systems constantly pull in vast amounts of data to function, and that nonstop processing requires more and more electricity. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s 2024 report for the U.S. Department of Energy found that data center energy use has been growing steadily and could account for 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028.

That’s on top of the energy needed to power electric vehicles, domestic manufacturing, hydrogen technology, and industrial electrification—leaving the grid under immense strain. It’s not just a matter of unplugging these data centers. Their backup power systems create headaches of their own. Reuters reports that the rapid growth of data centers—driven by AI and crypto mining—forces grid operators to plan for new contingencies, making the already tricky task of balancing electricity supply and demand even harder.

Consequences of leaving next to the data centers: It consumes everything around

Even when blackouts are avoided, living near these power-hungry facilities isn’t without consequences. Residents can experience shorter lifespans for electrical appliances, which can overheat or fail, and in some cases even cause fires. On top of that, there’s air, noise, and light pollution—making it one of the rare cases where a “not in my backyard” attitude might actually make sense.

Better EV Stock: Rivian vs. Tesla was originally published by The Motley Fool","Key Points

Both Rivian and Tesla are facing headwinds with tariffs and the end of federal EV tax credits.

Rivian has a big opportunity with the launch of its cheaper R2 SUV.

Meanwhile, Tesla's core business has struggled.

10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has dominated the electric vehicle (EV) market for over a decade, but the company's core business has begun to struggle. Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN), meanwhile, is still in the early innings as an automaker, but is starting to hit important milestones.

Both stocks come with risk, but one has a much better setup for investors right now.

Rivian's R2 opportunity

Rivian slipped back into negative gross margins in Q2 after two straight positive quarters, with higher material costs due to supply constraints and new tariffs taking their toll. The loss of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit this fall will be another drag. Those are real headwinds, but they don't take away from the progress that Rivian has been making.

Building out a profitable EV business is not easy, with even major automakers often struggling to sell their EV models for a profit. However, Rivian took a big step in this direction when it switched to a zonal architecture. This slashed the number of electronic control units and wiring in its vehicles, making its SUVs cheaper to build. It also helped the company secure a major partnership with Volkswagen, which opened up its checkbook to gain access to the technology and form a joint venture.

The next big step for Rivian will be launching its new, smaller R2 SUV next year. At a starting price of around $45,000, it will target a much broader audience than the R1 luxury line, which costs over $100,000 for some versions. Importantly, Rivian has locked in costs through supplier contracts and expects the R2 to deliver stronger margins through lower material costs, higher volumes, and shared fixed expenses with its R1 and electric delivery van lines.

On the financial front, Rivian is backed by Amazon, which uses its delivery vans, and it still has more cash coming from Volkswagen if and when certain milestones are reached. It has also secured a $6.6 billion loan from the Department of Energy to help build a second U.S. plant. With $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of capital to support the R2 launch. Management is targeting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven by 2027, which seems like a realistic timeline if the R2 is successful.

Rivian is still a high-risk name, but it has the balance sheet, the partners, and the right vehicle strategy to grow into a profitable business.

Tesla is losing momentum

Tesla's core auto business has been heading in the wrong direction. Deliveries dropped double digits in each of the past two quarters, while auto revenue slid 16% in Q2. Profitability and cash flow have also taken a hit. Adjusted EPS dropped 23% last quarter, while operating cash flow fell 30% and free cash flow collapsed to just $146 million.

Meanwhile, its high gross margin regulatory credit sales were cut by more than half during the quarter. Musk has already warned investors that things could get worse once the EV tax credit disappears later this year.

Rather than focusing on improving its ailing auto business, Musk has instead continued to try to sell investors on Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics ambitions. The company has launched a small pilot robotaxi program in Austin, Texas, but the service is limited to a geofenced area and requires a Tesla employee as a safety driver. It's also already drawn scrutiny from local officials after several safety incidents.

Tesla is promising a rapid rollout of robotaxis across half the U.S. by year-end pending regulatory approvals, but the technology does not appear ready. Its decision to eschew lidar technology and use a camera-only approach remains controversial. This design saves costs, but the technology has struggled in some complex driving conditions, leading to questions around the safety of its approach. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo robotaxi is far ahead, with years of experience operating paid, driverless rides in multiple cities.

Which EV stock wins?

Both Tesla and Rivian stocks carry their fair share of risk. Rivian is still unprofitable and faces near-term headwinds from tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits. Tesla, however, has a weakening auto business, a valuation that assumes big success in robotaxis and robotics, and a CEO whose actions have hurt the brand with many consumers.

Between the two, Rivian looks like the better investment. The company is improving its cost structure, expanding its market with the R2 SUV, and has the support of well-financed partners to help fund its growth. Tesla's stock, by contrast, is still priced as if its autonomous driving and robotics bets will pay off, even though it has yet to prove they can.

For investors willing to take on risk, Rivian is the better EV stock to own in my view.

However, one of the individuals didn't quite cover their face in time, allowing the Tesla owner to get a decent identifying image.

""They even knew it was recording,"" the stunned Tesla owner captioned the video footage. ""And still epically failed.""

Unfortunately, this isn't the only time a Tesla driver has caught someone in the act. People have been filmed purposefully scratching a vehicle's bodywork, while another has been caught throwing things towards a moving Tesla.

Tesla's — and electric cars in general — offer numerous benefits to vehicle owners, but some people just haven't gotten the memo. EVs are much cheaper to refuel, require less maintenance thanks to fewer moving parts, and do not produce any planet-warming emissions when on the move.

Even when considering the environmentally damaging mining required to extract precious metals for battery construction, this activity is still better than the vast drilling and extraction of dirty fuels needed to power internal combustion engine cars.

But actions like the ones detailed here discourage people from making their next car an EV. We have to reduce the planet-warming emissions produced by the vehicle sector, which make up 28% of the total warming gases produced by the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Moving away from gas-guzzling cars is one way to do so.

One commenter on Reddit was baffled by what they saw. ""I don't get it,"" they began. ""All you're doing is causing someone a minor inconvenience. They can just plug it back in when they get the alert on their phone that it was disconnected.""

“Repealing environmental protections and rescinding [the endangerment] finding will make stories like mine more common,” Lyttle said.","When US Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin announced last month his official proposal to rescind the agency’s foundational determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health and welfare, he insinuated that previous administrations (under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden) had “twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science” in order to achieve their regulatory agendas. And the regulations of these planet-warming emissions, not the emissions themselves like carbon dioxide, are “the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods,” Zeldin suggested.

EPA’s greenhouse gas endangerment finding, established in 2009, serves as the basis of its legal obligation under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources such as motor vehicles and power plants. The finding was based on an extensive review of the scientific record, which has gotten even more robust over the last 16 years, and has survived all legal challenges brought against it.

The Trump administration’s move to do away with the finding contradicts the overwhelming scientific evidence that greenhouse gas emissions are driving dangerous climate change impacts. There are also arguments to be made that it is unlawful. And, it goes against the pleas of the hundreds of Americans who have spoken out this week in opposition to Zeldin’s sweeping deregulatory proposal. In other words, contrary to Zeldin’s assertion, it is actually the Trump administration that is twisting or ignoring the law and public sentiment and warping science.

Let’s start with the science. The world’s premier body of climate scientists—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—has stated that it is “unequivocal” that human activities are warming the planet and causing rapid and widespread changes, such as more extreme weather, that are unprecedented over millennia. The US Fifth National Climate Assessment report observes that “harmful impacts from more frequent and severe extremes are increasing across the country” and notes that “climate changes are making it harder to maintain safe homes and healthy families; reliable public services; a sustainable economy; thriving ecosystems, cultures, and traditions; and strong communities.” These are authoritative statements from reports involving hundreds of scientists and extensive peer review.

What the Trump administration is doing with repealing the endangerment finding and all GHG regulations that flow from it, therefore, could be a violation of international law under the ICJ’s recent advisory opinion.

But to support its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, Trump’s EPA relies instead on a new report issued by the Department of Energy (DOE) that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and claims that GHG emissions and climate impacts are not harmful. The report, hastily written by five climate skeptics over a period of just two months, recycles many climate denialist talking points and, according to one analysis, includes over 100 false or misleading statements. As science historian Naomi Oreskes puts it, “Climate denial is now the official policy of the US government.”

“What the Trump administration and the Department of Energy did is pull together this small hand-picked group of people to work in secret to write this report that questions that mountain of scientific evidence that climate change is harming people,” said Erin Murphy, a senior attorney at Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).

“In and of itself, the conclusions of that report are inaccurate and inconsistent with the vast, vast majority of scientific findings and the consensus across the scientific community,” she added. “But also, the report is inconsistent with federal law.”

EDF and the Union of Concerned Scientists have filed a lawsuit against the DOE, the EPA, and the group of five climate skeptics arguing that the secretive manner in which the report was pulled together violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates transparency and opportunities for public engagement in government advisory proceedings.

The report has not gone through formal peer review, and although it is currently open to public comment, the time window for commenting is limited to just 30 days (closing on September 2) during a month when many people take vacations or might otherwise be unavailable. And until this week, none of the hundreds of comments that have come in were publicly visible. That hiding of the comments, Murphy said, “further underscores the government’s efforts to do this in secret.”

The lawsuit aims to block the Trump administration from using this report in its efforts to rescind the endangerment finding.

It was clear to me that the speakers—from environmental groups, the medical community and scientists to municipal and state governments and private citizens—were overwhelmingly united in their disapproval of the nixing of EPA’s foundational finding that GHG emissions endanger our health and welfare.

Even if EPA plows ahead and finalizes its move to eliminate the finding, that action will certainly be challenged in court. It remains to be seen what legal arguments environmental groups and other challengers will put forth.

One thing that is clear is that climate action is no longer optional, but rather a legal obligation, as several international courts have affirmed in recent landmark climate change advisory opinions. The International Court of Justice, considered the world’s highest court, delivered its opinion on July 23. The ICJ clarified that states have obligations under multiple sources of international law to reduce emissions and that governments must regulate the emissions of private actors. The customary law duty to prevent significant environmental harm to the climate system, which applies to all countries regardless of whether they are parties to specific treaties, includes putting in place “regulatory mitigation mechanisms” to reduce GHG emissions, the court said. Such rules “must regulate the conduct of public and private operators.” According to the court, failure to act in good faith to regulate emissions could be considered an unlawful act.

What the Trump administration is doing with repealing the endangerment finding and all GHG regulations that flow from it, therefore, could be a violation of international law under the ICJ’s recent advisory opinion. And while the opinion itself is nonbinding, it may be invoked in domestic court proceedings around the world, including in the US.

Zeldin’s endangerment finding rescission also seems to be untenable in the court of public opinion. “In repealing the endangerment finding, the Trump administration is stepping far out of line with public opinion, as voters across partisanship are in strong agreement that greenhouse gas emissions are a threat to public health and should be regulated,” Data for Progress says in reference to new poll results it released last week.

EPA held virtual public hearings last week on its proposal, and almost everyone who testified spoke in opposition to eliminating the endangerment finding. Out of the roughly 200 people who spoke on Tuesday, fewer than 10 voiced support for EPA’s rollback, Inside Climate News reports. I tuned into some of the hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, and it was clear to me that the speakers—from environmental groups, the medical community and scientists to municipal and state governments and private citizens—were overwhelmingly united in their disapproval of the nixing of EPA’s foundational finding that GHG emissions endanger our health and welfare.

“The EPA has a responsibility to regulate greenhouse gases for what they are—a clear, present, and growing threat to the health and well-being of every American,” Kim Cobb, a climate scientist, told the EPA panel in concluding her testimony.

Tiffany Covarrubias Lyttle, a registered nurse and mother of seven children, said during her testimony that the father of her children recently passed away from cancer, specially an environmentally triggered adenocarcinoma.

“Repealing environmental protections and rescinding [the endangerment] finding will make stories like mine more common,” Lyttle said. “Clean air, clean water, and a stable climate aren’t just environmental issues. They are in fact a matter of life and death.”",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60001131&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-08-24 12:07:34.060513

The warehouse giant, which is famous for bulk bargains and $1.99 pizza slices, has started testing fast charging stalls at its North Port, Florida store.

The project is a collaboration with Electric Era, a startup founded by former SpaceX engineers, and it could turn a weekly Costco run into a weekly recharge.

If the pilot proves successful, it might set the stage for a nationwide rollout that changes how millions of Americans shop and power their cars.

Fast EV charging while you shop

Electric Era’s six new stalls went up in just 54 days, and they’re nothing like the slow Level 2 chargers that can take all day to top up a car.

Instead, these are fast chargers capable of bringing an EV battery from nearly empty to 80 percent in as little as 20 minutes.

While this pales in comparison to BYD’s new lightning-fast chargers, which can charge the same amount in only five minutes, the 20-minute chargers work just fine.

After all, this is also probably the minimum amount of time it takes to complete a Costco trip.

The idea is simple: shoppers can park, stock up on bulk groceries and household goods, and return to a vehicle that’s ready for the road.

The timing couldn’t be better.

EV adoption in the US is currently outpacing the build-out of reliable charging infrastructure.

Over 1 million new EVs were registered in 2024, and July 2025 was almost the biggest ever month for US EV sales on record.

Yet drivers often complain about crowded charging stations, long wait times, or chargers that simply don’t work.

And while Tesla’s Supercharger network is growing quickly, it’s still not enough to keep up with the sheer number of EVs out there.

By leveraging its 531 US warehouse locations, Costco could help close the gap with thousands of fast charging stalls, without the need for government funding or incentives.

Costco may or may not expand this partnership

At the end of the day, reliable fast EV charging is the holy grail for owners of electric cars.

Level 3 chargers like the ones installed in North Port deliver a meaningful charge in under an hour, compared to six to eight hours at a Level 2 stall.

And with Tesla opening its Supercharger network to other automakers, demand for fast, hassle-free charging is only climbing.

Costco’s partnership with Electric Era offers an alternative that fits seamlessly into everyday life.

There are still questions, of course.

Will Costco expand this beyond a single store? Will the stalls be able to handle peak weekend shopping rushes?

If the answers are yes, a Costco membership could soon come with an unexpected perk: charging your car while you shop.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Electric-Era-at-Costco.webp,N,,2025-08-24 12:08:37.290985

The notice came just as school districts prepare to start their new year, some of them with buses that “cost roughly $345,000 each [and] are now so buggy they are sitting idle,” Politico reports.

“They ran properly for approximately two weeks, then we started getting error messages,” Andrew Dolloff, the superintendent of schools in Yarmouth, Maine, said of the two Lion e-buses his district bought with a federal government grant. The U.S. currently has an estimated 480,000 to 547,000 school buses in operation.

“It’s certainly important,” said Sue Gander, who runs the electric school bus initiative at the Washington, DC-based World Resources Institute. “You want a warranty on your blender, for god’s sake.”

Montreal real estate giant Groupe MACH, a lead investor in the new ownership group, did not respond to a request from The Energy Mix to comment on the Politico post or explain its apparent decision to rescind the warranties. We’ll update this story when we hear back from them.

One of the biggest e-bus grants from the Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency sent $9.9 million to Herscher Community Unit School District #2 in Illinois, enabling the district to buy 25 Lion buses—half of its fleet—and a $450,000 bus barn equipped with charging stations. Now, the district is “really struggling” with one or two of the buses, Superintendent Richard Decman told Politico, and of course “your vocal minority has politicized all this, and thinks [the buses are] the dumbest thing that’s ever been brought on planet Earth.”

But apart from the warranty issue, the buses operate well in winter weather, save the district $7,500 per vehicle per year on diesel fuel—and they also protect child health, reduce air and noise pollution, and serve local electrical grids with their “batteries on wheels”.

Over time, Decman said Herscher wants to keep on building its electric fleet. “The kids love ‘em,” he told Politico. “It’s a much more pleasant ride. It’s quiet, they can hear each other talk.”

More widely, many of the Lion buses are still “working fine. So are vehicles from other bus makers that are financially sound, such as Georgia-based Blue Bird Corporation, which recently reported record profits,” the U.S.-based publication writes. “But school districts with Lion buses now have no recourse for repairs, just as they start ferrying children for the new school year.” Some of them are turning to former Lion employees who are helping them out at no cost, Politico says.

In mid-May, St. Jérôme, Quebec-based Lion looked like it had turned the corner when it announced a “definitive agreement” with a group of Quebec investors for its electric bus manufacturing operation. The new consortium includes serial entrepreneur and former Lion board member Pierre Wilkie and Groupe MACH founder and president Vincent Chiara.

Earlier in May, Lion looked like it was on its way to liquidation when the Quebec government refused any further public funds after investing tens of millions of dollars in the company. But then, the Wilkie/Groupe MACH consortium “agreed to provide new capital, bolstered by the renewal of a provincial government subsidy program that offers incentives to buyers of electric buses,” the Globe and Mail wrote at the time. The new owners said they would take the company private, with a more modest business plan likely focusing on electric school bus manufacturing in St. Jérôme.

“Retail shareholders will probably be wiped out,” the Globe stated, “while other investors could also lose the bulk of their holdings.”

It is more than just an environmental setback — it is a direct assault on states’ ability to hold polluters accountable.

At a time when rising seas, raging wildfires and record-breaking heat make the climate crisis impossible to ignore — last year alone was the hottest on record — the president’s move aims to cut off one of the few legal avenues left for demanding corporate responsibility in contributing to the climate crisis.

However, in an ironic twist, a new front in the climate fight may emerge — not from environmental champions, but from many of the Republican attorneys general who have long ignored the reality of climate change.

Across several states, Republican attorneys general led by Texas’s Ken Paxton (R), have launched a lawsuit against major asset managers such as BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, alleging antitrust violations tied to their environmental, social and governance or ESG investment practices. As far-fetched as it may sound, these lawsuits accuse the financial giants of investing in coal companies as part of a conspiracy to restrict coal production, which would lead to higher prices and make coal less attractive to end consumers.

Their goal is clear: to intimidate asset managers and others in finance out of climate-conscious investing.

Yet these lawsuits may have an unintended consequence, opening a legal window into the inner workings of the coal industry.

At the heart of their legal argument is that asset managers colluded with coal companies to restrict coal production, meaning the coal firms themselves are likely to be directly pulled into the case through the discovery process. And discovery will finally put sunlight on the coal companies’ own internal communications, dark-money funding efforts and strategy memos, among other materials. The findings will provide a solid road map outlining the coal companies’ decades-long efforts to obstruct the energy transition, fund climate disinformation and pressure regulators to maintain the status quo.

Although we have had some snapshots into their tactics, environmentalists have long suspected that the true depth of fossil fuel industry interference in addressing climate change goes far deeper than what has been reported. Now, litigation intended to punish climate-minded investors might help prove it.

If these lawsuits move forward, they will hopefully expose the very tactics that have kept America hooked on outdated and polluting energy sources. Transparency, even when born of political theater, can be a powerful accelerant for public pressure and future legal accountability.

To be clear, this is no reason to cheer on this latest chapter in the Republican Party’s shortsighted crusade against sustainable investing. The attacks on ESG principles are regressive and rooted in political posturing, even if most voters think they are folly. But amid the wreckage of Trump’s climate rollback, there is a glimmer of possibility. Sometimes the most unexpected cracks in the system let the truth shine through.

Trump may be trying to protect polluters from liability through his legally questionable executive orders, but some of his party’s own lawsuits could actually help expose them instead. For climate advocates, it’s a reminder: the fight for our planet will be waged in legislatures, courtrooms and, occasionally, in the very legal battles meant to undermine it.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/coal_wv_ap_0728-e1659043339427.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-24 12:08:29.386289

The many opportunities for contamination mean that affected community water systems can’t always determine how the chemicals ended up there.","The warnings came in the mail this spring to 47 community water systems serving more than 400,000 Illinois residents: Elevated levels of harmful PFAS, better known as “forever chemicals,” had been found in their drinking water.

The notice, mailed by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in April, was triggered by a tighter federal PFAS standard adopted by the state’s pollution control board that month. The state told the water systems to immediately notify their customers by mail, email, post card, text message or telephone.

In some cases, other communities would tap into these water systems in an emergency, so the Illinois EPA sent another notice in May to warn those other systems.

PFAS — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — are found in products ranging from clothing to food wrappers and have caused water problems nationwide. Researchers have linked even low levels of chronic PFAS exposure to health effects such as kidney cancer, thyroid disease and ulcerative colitis. Illinois’ revised groundwater quality criteria cover six PFAS chemicals, with notices issued if high levels of any one compound are detected.

“The possible health effects from PFAS depend on numerous factors, including how much a person is exposed, so it is important to minimize PFAS exposure,” the state EPA said in its letter. It noted that residents who wanted to take action could treat their own water with carbon filters or reverse osmosis — but it also warned that in-home treatments “may not always reduce PFAS below levels of concern.”

The community water system in Crest Hill, 30 miles southwest of Chicago, was among those receiving the Illinois EPA letters. The agency said two PFAS chemicals — perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) — were found in excessive quantities in two of the city’s wells. PFOA was detected at 13.7 parts per trillion, over three times its regulated limit of 4 ppt. Meanwhile, PFHxS was found at 12.2 ppt, exceeding its 10 ppt limit.

Crest Hill informed residents about the PFAS issue by mail in April, noting that six of the city’s eight wells were uncontaminated. City engineer Ron Wiedeman said state law mandates municipalities exceeding PFAS limits to continue water analysis until 2027, with full results sent to all customers at that time. A large-scale PFAS reduction plan must then be implemented by April 2029.

Wiedeman also acknowledges residents’ confusion regarding when officials became aware of the contamination. Despite analyzing Crest Hill’s wells in 2021 and 2023, the Illinois EPA did not inform cities of the potential dangers until this April, after the state adopted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s standard set last year.

“There were no maximum restrictions on PFAS, so we didn’t know if we were above or below regulatory limits,” Wiedeman said. “When [Illinois EPA] officially adopted those regulations, then we knew we were over the limits.”

Other Chicago-area community water systems receiving letters from the Illinois EPA include Channahon, Fox Lake, South Elgin and the Criswell Court mobile home park in Joliet, according to the agency.

A lot of work ahead on PFAS

PFAS pollutes the environment through spills, leaks, industrial processes and the disposal of PFAS-containing products. The many opportunities for contamination mean that affected community water systems can’t always determine how the chemicals ended up there.

For instance, a PFAS chemical found in firefighting foams called fluorotelomer sulfonate had been used in Crest Hill, but no direct link exists between its usage and the detected contamination, Wiedeman noted.

“Unfortunately, there is nothing that we can directly point at,” Wiedeman said. “We know of some incidents in the city where fire foam was used, but the locations don’t match to where we have the highest readings of PFAS.”

He added: “PFAS is everywhere, but a lot of people don’t know it.”

As part of the new groundwater quality regulations, the Illinois EPA is collecting PFAS data from every water system in the state. The agency provided guidance to local officials through seven PFAS health advisories issued between 2021 and 2024, EPA public information officer Kim Biggs said in an email.

“We will continue our work with community water systems to ensure residents receive information on these important issues, as well as working with systems to determine any necessary actions to reduce exposure to PFAS,” Biggs said.

Crest Hill’s long-term strategy for mitigating PFAS risk involves transitioning to highly treated Lake Michigan water. Wiedeman said the pipeline infrastructure to make that possible likely will be completed in 2030, when the city’s water will be purified by Chicago’s state-of-the art treatment plants.

“That will handle PFAS or any future contaminants that get into the water,” Wiedeman said.

Processes to mitigate PFAS include reverse osmosis, which harnesses high-pressure membranes to filter out toxins. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago are investigating ways to not just remove but utterly eliminate these chemicals.

Led by chemical engineering professor Brian Chaplin, the UIC system employs reactive electrochemical membrane filtration, using adsorbents and catalysts on the membrane to trap and destroy PFAS as tainted water passes through.

The $1 million project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Alliance for Water Innovation, is in the prototype phase. Researchers will then test the system in California’s Orange County water district.

“Our goal is to avoid the need for further treatment and destroy PFAS right on site,” Chaplin said. “When we complete this work, this new technology will be ready to be piloted in the industrial and municipal wastewater sectors.”

The system could operate on a smaller scale as well, similar to a water-pitcher filter or water softener. Illinois residents concerned about PFAS can also dump their non-stick cooking pans and similar polluting products, Chaplin added.

“Use cast iron and stainless steel instead,” he said. “Consumers have more power than they realize. If enough people don’t buy these products, the market will have to adjust.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e55c687/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1199+0+151/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcf%2F81%2F652e64a74cc8ace7a775e3bd3c8d%2Fwater-faucet-color.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:07:48.309253

On the question ""Do you agree that the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue operating once the competent authority has confirmed that there are no safety concerns?"" 74 percent were in favor while 26 percent were against, according to the Central Election Commission.

However, the number of affirmative votes fell short of the 25 percent of eligible voters required for the referendum to pass.

""The failure to reach the threshold shows controversy remains,"" said Chen Jong-shun (陳中舜), an associate researcher at the Center for Green Economy of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.

Chen suggested that based on previous project experience Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) could in theory and with broad social consensus restart operations at the plant in ""as little as two years."" However, as there is currently no such consensus ""the future is still unclear.""

Meanwhile, Chen Shih-hau (陳詩豪), director-general of the Research Division V of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said energy security must also consider public opinion, otherwise it ""only increases variables"" in Taipower's planning.

Citing the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei as an example, he noted that the long-delayed project, which never entered commercial operation, created supply pressures in northern Taiwan until a gas-fired generator at the Datan Power Plant in Taoyuan came online.

Those delays, he said, forced the continued operation of heavy oil-fired units at the Hsieh-ho Power Plant in Keelung, delaying the plant's planned conversion from oil to natural gas.

Chen Shih-hau acknowledged that restarting existing plants is less costly than building new ones, but shutting down large nuclear facilities has ""a significant impact,"" which is ""why energy planning emphasizes diversification.""

""The most feasible form of distributed energy in the future is solar power with electric vehicle storage, followed by natural gas storage with gas-fired units and geothermal,"" said Tsuang Ben-jei (莊秉潔), professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering at National Chung Hsing University.

Tsuang estimates such power would cost NT$5 (US$0.16) to NT$10 per kilowatt-hour.

He noted that the state-run oil refiner, CPC Corp., Taiwan, operates a natural gas storage facility 3,000 meters underground in Miaoli County, which he said could supply Taiwan with 26 days of reserve energy.

That amount of power exceeds the province's average hourly demand, and accounts for nearly 45 per cent of all projects proposed since October 2023.
Noel, of the Pembina Institute, said those rules were slow to roll out and ended up introducing new costs and delays.
Smith previously said that, in 2023, Alberta accounted for 92 per cent of all of Canada's new renewable projects.
Reid-Carlson said the energy market restructuring is making it difficult for energy suppliers to get projects going.","Nearly half of proposed renewable energy projects in Alberta are failing to get off the ground, according to a new report from the Pembina Institute, a Canadian clean-energy think tank.

The report's findings, which were released Thursday, come after the provincial government placed a seven-month moratorium on new starts for all wind, solar and geothermal energy projects.

Since the freeze lifted last February, proposed projects — that are estimated to produce 11 gigawatts combined — have been cancelled, the report says. That amount of power exceeds the province's average hourly demand, and accounts for nearly 45 per cent of all projects proposed since October 2023.

""Wind and solar, especially, will typically bring the price of power down when they're operating,"" Will Noel, a Pembina Institute senior electricity analyst, told CBC News.

If projects don't keep pace, power prices could rise, Noel said. The rural communities, where many of these projects were planned, would also miss out on greater tax revenues.

The report found that, while renewables have tapered off, far fewer gas electricity projects were cancelled.

Ed Whittingham, a renewable energy consultant, wasn't surprised. He said the sector was picking up steam, but the moratorium killed all momentum and scared investors.

""This is what happens when you take a booming industry and then you immediately throw a wet blanket on top of it,"" Whittingham said.

When the freeze came, Premier Danielle Smith said the sector had been moving too fast, without enough regulations. The provincial government has since doled out new rules that restrict projects in certain agricultural areas, and locations with pristine views.

Noel, of the Pembina Institute, said those rules were slow to roll out and ended up introducing new costs and delays. He added that it's too soon to know the full effect the regulations will have.

The Alberta government is trying to follow a balanced approach to renewables, and still leads the country in renewable investment, Utilities Minister Nathan Neudorf told CBC in an emailed statement, in response to questions about the report.

Smith previously said that, in 2023, Alberta accounted for 92 per cent of all of Canada's new renewable projects.

""Cancellations in the early stages of the connection process are expected and occur for many reasons,"" Neudorf said in the statement, noting supply and demand in the market as a potential factor.

Other industry watchers are saying that the freeze might have come at a time when the bubble on renewables was already close to popping.

Duane Reid-Carlson, an independent energy consultant, said the entire energy market is seeing a decline in new projects, even if renewable projects were the most affected.

""We've overbuilt; renewables were a major part of that,"" Reid-Carlson said.

Many approved projects stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a build-up on the docket, he added.

Keeping data centers cool Data centers store information and perform complex calculations for businesses, whose increasing automation is steadily ramping up such needs.
After hauling up the pod two years later, Microsoft found that underwater data centers ""are reliable, practical and use energy sustainably.""
Environmental concerns In spite of the apparent benefits of underwater data centers, some concerns remain — especially over potential environmental impacts.
But other researchers say submerged data centers could harm aquatic biodiversity during a marine heat wave — a period of unusually high ocean temperatures.","To grow its economy, China is betting big on artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other digital technology — and a big part of that bet involves rapidly building data centers to boost computing power. But these massive collections of servers gobble up growing amounts of energy, and each one cycles through hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a day to carry away the heat they generate.

That means these facilities — in China and beyond — will increasingly compete with water demand linked directly to human survival, from agriculture to daily drinking. Many companies have sited their data centers in some of the driest regions of the world, including Arizona, parts of Spain, and the Middle East, because dry air reduces the risks of damage to the equipment from humidity, according to an investigation by the nonprofit journalist organization SourceMaterial and the Guardian. Partly to address water concerns, China is now putting a data center in the wettest place there is: the ocean. This June construction began on a wind-powered underwater data center about six miles off the coast of Shanghai, one of China's AI hubs.

""China's ambitious approach signals a bold shift toward low-carbon digital infrastructure, and it could influence global norms in sustainable computing,"" says Shabrina Nadhila, an analyst at energy-focused think tank Ember, who has researched data centers.

Keeping data centers cool

Data centers store information and perform complex calculations for businesses, whose increasing automation is steadily ramping up such needs. These facilities consume vast amounts of electricity and water because their servers work nonstop and in close proximity — and they generate waste heat as a by-product, which can damage equipment and destroy data. So they need to be constantly cooled.

Roughly 40 percent of the electricity consumed by an ordinary data center is for this purpose. Most of that energy is used to chill water, which is sprayed into the air that circulates around the servers or is allowed to evaporate near them, lowering their temperatures. That water can come from underground, from nearby rivers or streams, or from reclaimed wastewater.

Instead undersea data centers use pipes to pump seawater through a radiator on the back of server racks to absorb heat and carry it away. Hailanyun — the company sometimes referred to as HiCloud that is behind the Shanghai data center — says an assessment conducted with the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology shows its project uses at least 30 percent less electricity than on-land data centers, thanks to natural cooling.

Related: AI is entering an 'unprecedented regime.' Should we stop it — and can we — before it destroys us?

The Shanghai center will also be connected to a nearby offshore wind farm that is set to supply 97 percent of its energy, says Hailanyun spokesperson Li Langping.

The project's first phase is designed to contain 198 server racks — enough to hold 396 to 792 AI-capable servers — and is slated to begin operation in September, Li says. It is expected to provide enough computing power to complete the equivalent of training GPT-3.5 — the large language model that OpenAI released in 2022 and used to fine-tune ChatGPT — in the space of a day, he adds. Yet Hailanyun's Shanghai center is small compared with a typical land-based one: a medium-scale data center in China normally has up to 3,000 standard racks, while a superscale version can contain more than 10,000.

Leapfrogging the U.S.

At the core of Hailanyun's $223-million Shanghai gambit is a technology that Microsoft pioneered more than a decade ago under an effort called Project Natick, in which the company sank a shipping-container-sized capsule holding more than 800 servers 117 feet below the surface off the coast of Scotland. After hauling up the pod two years later, Microsoft found that underwater data centers ""are reliable, practical and use energy sustainably.""

The experiment also resulted in fewer broken servers compared with on-land data centers because the vessel was sealed off and filled with nitrogen, which is less corrosive than oxygen, Microsoft said in a 2020 press release. The lack of people also meant that the equipment avoided physical contacts or movements that may otherwise cause them damage in an on-land center, the company said.

But Microsoft has reportedly shelved Project Natick. A company spokesperson did not answer questions about whether or not the project was terminated. Instead, they provided a statement: ""While we don't currently have data centers in the water, we will continue to use Project Natick as a research platform to explore, test, and validate new concepts around data center reliability and sustainability.""

Hailanyun aims to leapfrog American companies: if the Shanghai project is successful, Li expects his company to springboard toward large-scale deployments of offshore, wind-powered undersea data centers with the support of the Chinese government.

Zhang Ning, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, who specializes in next-generation low-carbon infrastructure, notes that Hailanyun has moved from a pilot project conducted in Hainan in December 2022 to commercial rollouts in less than 30 months — ""something Microsoft's Project Natick never attempted.""

Environmental concerns

In spite of the apparent benefits of underwater data centers, some concerns remain — especially over potential environmental impacts. Microsoft researchers found their pod had caused some localized warming in the sea, though the impact was limited. ""The water just meters downstream of a Natick vessel would get a few thousandths of a degree warmer at most,"" they wrote.

But other researchers say submerged data centers could harm aquatic biodiversity during a marine heat wave — a period of unusually high ocean temperatures. In those cases, the outlet water from the vessel would be even warmer and hold less of the oxygen that aquatic creatures need to survive, a 2022 paper said.

Another concern is security. A 2024 study found that undersea data centers can be destroyed by certain noises carried out by underwater speaker systems, which raises concerns about malicious attacks using sound.

In response to such concerns, Hailanyun says its undersea data centers are ""environmentally friendly,"" citing an assessment conducted on one of its test pods in southern China's Pearl River in 2020. ""The heat dissipated by the undersea data center caused less than one degree of temperature rise in the surrounding water,"" Li says. ""It virtually did not cause any substantial impact.""

The undersea data center concept seems to have growing appeal beyond China. Countries including South Korea have also announced plans to pursue them, while Japan and Singapore are mulling data centers that float on the ocean's surface instead.

Zhang says that whether other coastal areas will dive into the trend hinges less on technical feasibility and more on how quickly would-be operators can resolve the regulatory, ecological and supply-chain questions that ""China is now tackling at scale.""",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ctBjaKPynfZmcdnnEkvrDj.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:07:15.207090

At the same time, strategies need to be in place to handle the recycling of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, which typically degrade after about eight to ten years, according to a study on ScienceDirect.

Reducing the environmental impact of these components and the expected resource scarcity, particularly for lithium, cobalt, and nickel, are key factors for growth in the sector.

Recycled materials can often cost less than extracting more from the earth, and they help expand localized supply chains, enhance sustainability, and further reduce costs.

As both nations navigate the Trump administration's protectionist agenda and domestic economic priorities, investors must assess how these developments reshape opportunities in the auto, steel, and energy sectors. This analysis explores the strategic positioning of key industries and offers actionable insights for capitalizing on the evolving trade landscape.

Auto Sector: Stabilization and EV-Driven Opportunities

The auto industry has emerged as a focal point of Canada-US trade normalization. Canada's decision to drop retaliatory tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods, effective September 1, 2025, aligns with U.S. exemptions for auto imports, signaling a de-escalation of tensions. This move follows the U.S. extension of auto tariff exemptions indefinitely, providing stability for cross-border supply chains.

For investors, the auto sector's resilience hinges on two trends: electric vehicle (EV) adoption and supply chain reconfiguration. Canadian automakers and suppliers, such as Magna International (MGA) and Stellantis (STLA), are well-positioned to benefit from U.S. demand for EV components, particularly as the U.S. seeks to reduce reliance on Asian supply chains. Additionally, the removal of tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods reduces production costs for Canadian manufacturers, enhancing their competitiveness.

Investors should monitor Tesla (TSLA) and other EV leaders for signals of sector momentum, as U.S. policy shifts (e.g., tax credits for domestic EV production) could further accelerate demand. However, risks remain, including potential U.S. tariffs on non-USMCA imports and geopolitical disruptions.

Steel Sector: Protectionism and Strategic Diversification

The steel industry remains a flashpoint in Canada-US trade dynamics. The U.S. doubled Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% in June 2025, excluding USMCA-compliant imports. While this protects U.S. domestic producers like Nucor (NUE) and U.S. Steel (X), it pressures Canadian steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal Dofasco (MT) and Stelco (STL).

Canada's retention of 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum reflects its leverage in negotiations, but long-term sustainability depends on USMCA compliance and diversification. For example, Canadian steel producers with U.S. market access under USMCA may mitigate tariff impacts, while those reliant on non-USMCA exports face headwinds.

Investors should prioritize U.S. steel companies with strong domestic demand and low-cost production, as well as Canadian firms with diversified export markets. However, the sector's volatility—driven by potential further U.S. tariffs or global supply chain shifts—warrants caution.

Energy Sector: Tariff-Driven Reconfiguration and Renewable Shifts

The energy sector faces a dual challenge: U.S. tariffs on critical materials and the transition to renewables. The 50% Section 232 copper tariff, effective August 1, 2025, has raised costs for U.S. energy infrastructure, particularly for transformers and grid components. Similarly, a pending Section 232 investigation into critical minerals could impose tariffs on materials essential for solar, wind, and battery technologies.

Canada's energy exports to the U.S. remain critical, with crude oil and natural gas accounting for 70% of U.S. hydrocarbon imports. However, U.S. tariffs on Canadian energy imports (10% for crude, 25% for Mexican) have forced companies to re-evaluate long-term contracts and explore domestic production. For example, Canadian energy firms like Enbridge (ENB) and Suncor (SU) are pivoting toward U.S. markets with USMCA-compliant exemptions, while U.S. companies are accelerating investments in domestic shale and renewables.

Investors should focus on energy companies with diversified portfolios and exposure to U.S. markets. For renewables, firms involved in critical mineral processing (e.g., lithium, cobalt) and grid infrastructure (e.g., copper recycling) offer long-term upside, despite near-term tariff risks.

Strategic Investment Recommendations

Auto Sector: Target EV supply chain players and U.S.-listed Canadian automakers with USMCA compliance. Monitor EV battery manufacturers and lithium producers for growth potential.

Steel Sector: Prioritize U.S. steel producers with low-cost domestic operations and Canadian firms with diversified export markets. Hedge against further U.S. tariff escalations.

Energy Sector: Invest in energy companies with U.S. market access and renewable energy infrastructure. Diversify exposure to critical minerals and grid technologies.

Conclusion

The Canada-US trade de-escalation in 2025 creates both opportunities and risks for key sectors. While the auto industry benefits from policy alignment, the steel and energy sectors must navigate protectionist pressures and supply chain reconfiguration. Investors who strategically position themselves in resilient, USMCA-compliant industries—and hedge against potential policy shifts—stand to capitalize on the evolving North American trade ecosystem. As the USMCA review looms, staying attuned to regulatory developments and sectoral trends will be critical for long-term success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-24 15:04:08.666712

Much of its hopes will be pinned on its new R2 SUV.

10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›

After two straight quarters of positive gross margins, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) returned to producing negative gross margins in the second quarter. This largely appears to be due to higher material costs, as China's cutback on the export of heavy rare-earth metals in the quarter disrupted supply chains and drove up the cost of electric vehicle (EV) production.

Meanwhile, a reduction of regulatory tax credits will be a headwind going forward, as the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit will expire at the end of September. As a result, Rivian lowered its expectations for 2025 regulatory credit sales from a prior outlook of $300 million down to $160 million. Tax credits are pure gross margin, so that reduction hurts. Tariffs will also be a headwind, with Rivian estimating that tariffs will cost it a couple of thousand dollars per vehicle.

The automaker said it is now looking for gross profits to be about breakeven for the full year. That is down from its prior outlook of it turning a modest gross profit in 2025. Gross margin and gross profit are key metrics for Rivian, as it must be able to make its vehicles for less than it sells them for to even think about becoming profitable and generating free cash flow down the road.

The R2 is key

Much of the company's focus is on preparing for the launch of its lower-priced R2 SUV next year, which is priced starting at around $45,000. Rivian is looking for the new SUV to have much wider appeal than its current luxury R1 SUVs, which can run over $100,000 for some configurations. The company will shut down its main manufacturing facility for three weeks in September in preparation for the launch. It expects peak deliveries to be in the third quarter of this year.

Despite the R2 coming in at a much cheaper price than the R1, it is expected to have a healthy gross margin. The smaller vehicle will have a much lower underlying cost structure due to lower materials costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Material costs will be around half those of the R1, and Rivian has contractually negotiated prices locked in with suppliers. The R2 will also benefit from higher expected volumes, as well as the shared fixed cost absorption from Rivian's facility that also manufactures the R1 and its electric delivery vans (EDVs).

With the launch of the R2 next year, the company is looking to be EBITDA breakeven in 2027 following a full year of the vehicle being in production. It also expects to benefit from increased momentum in its higher-margin software and services segment.

Turning to its Q2 results, Rivian's revenue rose by 12% to $1.3 billion despite fewer vehicle deliveries. The company produced 5,979 vehicles and delivered 10,661 in the quarter, compared to 9,612 vehicles produced and 13,790 delivered a year ago.

Automobile revenue dropped by 14% to $927 million, while software and service revenue surged from $84 million to $376 million. Management said its production volumes declined significantly due to supply chain complexities and trade policy shifts. Software revenue, meanwhile, was helped by strong contributions from its joint venture with Volkswagen.

The company was able to shrink its loss from $1.5 billion a year earlier to $1.1 billion. It also reduced its free cash outflows to $398 million from $1 billion a year ago.

Looking ahead, the EV maker maintained its deliveries forecast of between 40,000 and 46,000 units. It now expects an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $2 billion to $2.25 billion, versus earlier guidance for a loss of between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.

Should investors buy the dip?

Rivian has been facing some headwinds with both tariffs and trade policy supply chain disruptions. The end of the EV federal tax credit this fall will only add to that.

However, the company has made great strides in improving its cost structure, and the R2 is the future of the company. If the R2 can prove a success, the company should be on its way to generating free cash flow and profits in the future. In the meantime, with $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of liquidity to invest and grow its brands moving forward.

Rivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock, but I think risk-tolerant investors can use the drop in price to add a small position ahead of the R2 launch next year.

The Grain Belt Express project calls for work crews to have access to any part of the 160-acre farm at any time.
It’s also that he’s not convinced that power from the Grain Belt Express would be green, affordable or even necessary.
In a Grain Belt Express statement last month, Hanaway called Bailey’s investigation of the transmission line “unlawful and politically motivated.’’ On Tuesday, she told reporters she’ll recuse herself from Grain Belt Express deliberations when she becomes attorney general early next month.
Walling’s environmental coalition has already endorsed the Grain Belt Express.","For seven years, Michael Polsky has been trying to build a high-voltage power line from the windswept prairies of Kansas to the ravenous electrical grids of the Midwest and East Coast.

He brings plenty of firepower to the task.

His Chicago-based company Invenergy is the country’s largest privately held generator of renewable power. And his investors include Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm. But it’s been a seesaw battle, and the outcome is still in doubt.

One of the main problems for Polsky’s power line is that it needs to cross lots of farmland in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois. And lots of farmers hate the idea of eminent domain, especially when it’s a private developer such as Polsky who wants their land.

The Grain Belt Express has filed nearly 50 eminent domain lawsuits to obtain the right-of-way it needs in Missouri alone, according to Andrew Bailey, the state’s attorney general. Most of these cases have been settled, but emotions still run high. In Illinois, the state Supreme Court is also preparing to weigh in.

On July 2, Bailey opened an investigation into the Grain Belt Express for making false claims. Invenergy was grabbing land, he said in an earlier statement, “to satisfy the greed of private investors.’’

President Donald Trump followed up by canceling a loan guarantee for the transmission line. The president also accelerated the phase out of hefty tax credits for wind and solar farms, including those whose power the line was intended to carry.

Still, experts say that among all the energy developers in the United States, Polsky may be best equipped to navigate today’s treacherous political waters.

He’s got deep-pocketed Wall Street backers and an enormous tailwind in the prospect of soaring electricity prices for the foreseeable future. He can revert faster than most to any of the power plant technologies he’s already mastered, and to some still on the drawing board.

These include natural gas, which he may hook up to his Grain Belt Express after facing a backlash from Republican lawmakers over his ties to wind power, according to Bloomberg News. He may ship power from coal plants too, Bloomberg said.

“Polsky has always been ahead of the curve. He was one of the early entrants in utility-scale renewables and one of the first in utility-scale batteries,” said Mark Pruitt, an energy consultant.

Pruitt is the former head of the Illinois Power Agency. This state agency procures affordable power for low-income residents. “Nobody is always right all the time,” he said. “But Polsky has been right enough to continuously build his company.”

With the Grain Belt Express, Polsky is not just trying to build an 804-mile power line that starts in Kansas and ends just east of the Illinois line in Indiana. He’s planting the flag of private equity in a transmission business that up till now has mostly been the exclusive preserve of regulated utilities.

The power line would carry 5 gigawatts of electricity, or the equivalent of four nuclear reactors.

Polsky declined the Chicago Tribune’s interview requests. In an Inc. magazine profile last month, he presented himself as an engineer above all, a pragmatist more than an environmentalist, and someone planning to stay as governments come and go.

“Policies that make it more difficult,” he told the magazine, “are like facing a headwind for the first few miles of a marathon.”

Polsky will face another test of his political skill in October when the Illinois legislature, tormented by rising electricity rates, could vote on renewable-energy type credits for transmission lines, including the Grain Belt Express.

Farmers fight eminent domain

In Rosamond, Illinois, 35 miles southwest of Decatur, Joe Gleespen has been fighting the Grain Belt Express ever since he first heard of an initial version in 2014.

He’s a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully blocked the certificate of public necessity that the Illinois Commerce Commission had issued for the transmission line. Invenergy has appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court to restore the certificate, and a ruling could be a year away, according to Paul Neilan, a Bannockburn attorney representing Gleespen.

An adverse ruling could end Invenergy’s ability to build the transmission line in Illinois.

From the bay window in his gray, three-bedroom farmhouse, Gleespen looks south toward his neighbor’s cornfield, which is about the length of a football field away.

The Grain Belt Express aims to acquire about a third of this space, potentially through eminent domain, and construct transmission towers that could be as tall as 10-story buildings all along the south and west borders of his property.

The Grain Belt Express project calls for work crews to have access to any part of the 160-acre farm at any time. But the price the company is offering is “far below” the going rate for land in Christian County, according to Gleespen. And it’s only for the 16 acres that would make up the transmission right-of-way, not the whole farm.

Gleespen, 71, and his wife Lucy, 66, moved to the farm when they got married in 1980, seven years after his father had purchased it, and they raised their two daughters there. Their soybean plants now have leaves of deep green, a color indicating robust health. The plants stand about 42 inches tall, as if preening for the harvest just weeks away.

Gleespen has spent the last decade fighting not just the Grain Belt Express but also a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline on a separate piece of property he owns nearby. He still wakes up at night, he said, to jot down notes on how to preserve his farms.

It’s not just that Gov. JB Pritzker and the Illinois legislature, in his view, should never have allowed a private company such as Invenergy to wield eminent domain. It’s also that he’s not convinced that power from the Grain Belt Express would be green, affordable or even necessary.

All Illinoisans should be reducing their environmental footprint, Gleespen said, just as he and Lucy did by installing geothermal heating and air conditioning 20 years ago. Small nuclear reactors located near data centers, he said, could reduce the need for interstate transmission.

Gleespen is part of overlapping networks of like-minded farmers in Christian County and across the state. Christian County voted for Trump 3-1 last year and has recently begun requiring high-voltage operators, such as Invenergy, to bear the added expense of burying their future transmission lines.

“It’ll be a long and drawn-out affair for Grain Belt,” Gleespen said. “Even if they beat us in the Supreme Court, they’ll have to drag people into court on every one of those eminent domain cases.”

According to Neilan, the Illinois Supreme Court case will turn on a simple question — how much proof should Invenergy be required to present to state regulators to demonstrate it has the funds to complete a project that, if approved, would allow the company to go to court to seize property from farmers.

“The Illinois Commerce Commission dismissed out of hand the landowners’ concerns about having their property involuntarily taken from them for what amounts to a venture capital project,” Neilan said. “You don’t know whether they can even do this project.”

Brad Klein, a managing attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago, predicted that the court will side with the ICC. The legislature established the commission in the first place, Klein said, as an independent panel with the necessary skills for making this kind of complex policy decision.

In Illinois and Missouri, opponents claim Invenergy has grossly overstated the potential benefits of the Grain Belt Express by counting how much it could save on a federal carbon tax that never had much chance of being enacted, even before Trump took office.

Experts say companies routinely include a carbon tax in their future cost projections, if only as a proxy for the many ways climate change will affect how they operate. An Invenergy spokeswoman declined to respond to written questions about the carbon tax and other issues.

In his announcement in Missouri last month, Bailey specifically included carbon tax savings as one of what he called the false Invenergy claims that he needs to investigate.

On Monday, Trump named Bailey co-deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But as Bailey’s replacement, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe chose Catherine Hanaway, the lead counsel for the Grain Belt Express and a former Republican speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, according to a report in the Missouri Independent. In a Grain Belt Express statement last month, Hanaway called Bailey’s investigation of the transmission line “unlawful and politically motivated.’’

On Tuesday, she told reporters she’ll recuse herself from Grain Belt Express deliberations when she becomes attorney general early next month. The shakeup may help Polsky. But even the setback with Bailey’s inquiry came two years after the Missouri Public Service Commission gave its final approval to the Grain Belt Express, and seven years after the state’s Supreme Court declined to block the transmission line.

“If projects can’t count on certainty even after being approved and reviewed upon appeal, America can’t count on ever getting steel in the ground,” Invenergy said in a blog post. “America will lose the test of its will to build.”

The art of making electricity

For Polsky, to generate electricity is literally to live the American Dream.

He fled Soviet-controlled Ukraine in 1976 and arrived in Detroit with $500 in his pocket. A decade later, while a night student at the University of Chicago business school, he started a company that designed power plants. That is what he’d been trained to do in Kiev.

He quickly mastered the art of making electricity using everything from natural gas-driven turbines to wind and solar farms to storage batteries.

Today at age 76, he’s so rich that research institutes bearing his name are fighting cancer, teaching entrepreneurship and documenting how Jews died during the Holocaust.

From a glass skyscraper overlooking the South Branch of the Chicago River, Polsky manages 2,800 employees worldwide. He operates 212 generating and battery storage projects with a total capacity of 34 gigawatts. That’s enough to power 12 million homes.

On top of that, Polsky’s pipeline of future projects was worth $150 billion last year, according to The Wall Street Journal.

To gain a sense of the technical challenges Polsky has overcome, a good starting point is Rock Falls, a village 115 miles west of Chicago.

Polsky bought a half-built natural gas plant out of bankruptcy there in 2004, opened it a decade later and has since expanded its capacity to produce 980 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to that of a typical nuclear reactor.

Then, in 2022, Polsky began building a solar farm nearby to generate electricity for making hydrogen. The renewable energy credits he earned help finance the project.

Since then, he’s used green hydrogen to cool his natural gas turbines in Rock Falls. He plans to produce hydrogen for other markets such as chemicals and liquid fuels, according to an Invenergy statement.

Polsky’s excursion into the world of transmission lines became possible in 2009 when federal regulators first allowed private companies — so-called merchant operators — to build them.

Congress had fueled Polsky’s early career in 1992 by allowing private ownership of power plants.

Transmission lines are tougher because they cross more land with more people, said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C.-based energy consultancy.

Most transmission lines today are built by federally supervised regional grid operators such as Midwest Independent System Operator and PJM Interconnection. Each of these covers several states. In Illinois, PJM encompasses the northern fifth of the state, including the Chicago area. MISO covers the remainder of the state.

PJM and MISO routinely do forecasts on their long-term transmission needs, and they can order local utilities to help foot the bill.

Regulated utilities don’t face the same complaints from disgruntled farmers that they’re protecting greedy investors more than the public interest. But they’re still government-sanctioned monopolies. They rarely move as fast as private operators such as Polsky, or with the same tolerance for risk.

To keep up with accelerating demand from data centers and advanced manufacturers, the United States should be adding transmission lines four times faster than it is, Gramlich said.

Even today, transmission line developers are hopeful for some assistance from the administration, he said.

Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared transmission to be a priority. Various administration officials are focused on expanding the grid to enable the U.S. to win the artificial intelligence race with China, Gramlich said.

The Grain Belt Express would be a so-called high-voltage, direct current line, or HVDC. Among other things, this would allow power not just to flow to the east when the wind blows in Kansas, but also back to the west when a winter storm knocks out the state’s electrical grid, something that happened in 2021.

“There’s good nuclear in Illinois, very good wind energy to the west, and solar in different parts of the state and the region,” Gramlich said. “So if you just look at the optimum power system configuration, it calls for a lot of transmission in that region.”

The wind and solar tax credits Trump is phasing out can be worth up to 50% of the capitalized cost of such projects, energy industry officials say.

“Any energy project that thought they had a tax credit or a grant or a loan, I think the developer has to go back and reevaluate their project economics,’’ Gramlich said.

Before Trump even took office, Invenergy and its partners canceled an $11 billion underground transmission line intended to transport wind, solar, and hydro power from upstate New York to the borough of Queens in New York City.

The company is still planning overhead lines in Oklahoma and New Mexico. And it’s ready to break ground on the Grain Belt Express next year, assuming that all the financing and federal permits can be secured, according to its website.

In Missouri and Kansas, Invenergy has acquired 95% of the land it needs mostly through voluntary agreements, the company said in a statement. And it’s still seeking private financing for the Grain Belt Express.

“With the loan guarantee, the federal government was saying, `we’ll act as a backstop. We’ll guarantee that we’ll pay a certain price,’” said Chaz Teplin, head of power-grid analysis at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group in Basalt, Colorado.

Invenergy is talking with anyone who’s willing to make the same guarantee to buy power, Teplin said.

“For some companies like hyper-scalers and data center builders, power is a small portion of their costs,’’ he said. “We’ve seen this type of company willing to pay a premium for reliable and clean energy, as their facilities remain profitable.’’

Invenergy and Facebook parent Meta, to cite one example, already have close ties. In June, Invenergy agreed to supply an additional 791 megawatts of solar and wind energy for Meta’s data centers in Ohio, Arkansas and Texas. And both companies have a growing interest in nuclear power.

Meta is considering whether to help Constellation Energy expand its nuclear power station in Clinton, Illinois, according to a Chicago Tribune report in June. And Polsky recently told Inc. magazine he can already build everything for a nuclear plant except the reactor itself and may try to compete in this area.

The glass may be half full for Polsky in other ways, said Chris Seiple, vice chairman of Wood Mackenzie, a Boston-based research and data company.

“The renewables industry is very lucky that two things are happening as they are losing these tax credits,” Seiple said.

“The first is all the demand growth from artificial intelligence. And the second is that the cost of building a gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant has nearly doubled in the past three or four years,” he said.

“That means the cost of what renewables are competing with has become so much higher that they are largely competitive to meet the new demand growth without having to get the tax credit,” Seiple said.

Solar, wind and battery storage in the United States are now so affordable they accounted for 93% of all new capacity added to the country’s electricity grids last year, according to CleanView, a Miami-based research group.

A looming shortfall

Illinois remains a net energy exporter thanks to its 11 nuclear reactors, the most of any state.

However, a shortfall is looming as data center demand skyrockets and the state begins closing 28 gigawatts of coal- and natural-gas-generating plants by 2045 to improve air quality. The Trump administration may try to delay these closings. But in a recent study, the Illinois Power Agency projected steep increases in monthly bills over the next quarter-century to reserve future generating capacity for regional power grids.

The 5 gigawatts of power that Polsky wants to pump through his Grain Belt Express won’t solve the Illinois shortfall, as half of the power is being dropped off in Missouri, according to media reports in that state, and the rest will be shared among three regional grids and an electricity co-op that serve dozens of states.

Still, the comprehensive energy bill that the legislature is scheduled to take up in October could pave the way for renewable energy-type credits for the Grain Belt Express and Soo Green line, said Jen Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council. Soo Green is a transmission line that would run underground alongside a railroad track from Mason City, Iowa, to Yorkville, Illinois.

The comprehensive energy bill would also upgrade the state’s battery storage and energy efficiency programs.

“Labor hasn’t actively supported the bill yet, so one thing that could be helpful would be something labor is excited about, and some of that could be building more transmission,” Walling said.

Marc Poulos, a labor quarterback in Springfield, described the Grain Belt Express and Soo Green lines as “great projects.”

Poulos is the executive director of labor-management operations for International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150.

Walling’s environmental coalition has already endorsed the Grain Belt Express. But she said she won’t know if the coalition can support future transmission line credits until it learns more from state regulators about how much the program will cost.

Legislators are especially sensitive about costs after double-digit rate increases in June at ComEd and Ameren, and with pending votes on, among other things, the Chicago transit system’s budget shortfall.

“We want more transmission, but we need to spend our dollars wisely,” Walling said.

So, besides finding private financing for the Grain Belt Express in the next few months, Polsky will have to convince worried legislators in his home state that the project can deliver affordable electricity even in the face of Trump’s relentless attacks.

Polsky has been preparing for this test for a long time.

According to Inc. magazine, he chose to specialize in renewable energy and storage not just because they’re carbon-free, but also because — unlike fossil fuels — they’re at the dawn of vast efficiencies that come with mass production.

And Polsky has $2.5 billion in the bank, according to Forbes magazine. He can afford to be patient.

“An energy project takes years to develop and build, and operates for decades,” he told Inc. magazine. “So we take that long view.

“At the end of the day, technology listens to the market, not politicians.”

The Maryland Commission on Climate Change, Mitigation Working Group (MWG) has released its 2025 draft policy recommendations intended to make progress toward Maryland’s aggressive climate mitigation goals.

Emissions from cars, trucks, and other modes of transportation are the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland. Sluggish electric vehicle sales, withdrawal of federal subsidies for electric vehicle charging equipment and deauthorization of state authority to impose vehicle emissions mandates are major headwinds slowing progress toward Maryland’s transportation sector goals.

MWG is considering several related proposals, including requiring installation of electric vehicle charging equipment in new multifamily construction, reallocating funds from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund to provide additional rebates for Electric Vehicle purchases, and adopting a clean fuel standard to reduce emissions from heavy trucks and other vehicles.

Electric power generation remains the largest source of emissions. Environmental advocates are again pressing for an economy-wide tax on greenhouse gas emissions as well as emissions standards for fossil fuel power plants.

Also under consideration is a proposal to change the state’s greenhouse gas accounting method that would better count green power purchase agreements and renewable energy.",https://www.citybiz.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Naiop-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:07:59.430808

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Support 50% renewable energy generation targets by 2030.

Establish bankable projects financed under EXIM Bank programs, reducing reliance on non-compliant imports.

Create local employment opportunities in engineering, manufacturing, and project execution.

Deliver secure, future-proof energy systems that align with U.S. and Saudi regulatory frameworks.

The move could further constrain the US renewable energy industry and lead to additional tariffs.

Probe Initiated Under Trade Law

According to a Federal Register notice, the Department of Commerce began the investigation on August 13, 2025, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Interestingly, this statute allows the president to curb imports deemed a threat to US national security.

The notice did not provide concrete reasons behind the probe, but the administration has requested public input on issues such as reliance on foreign supply chains, the role of government subsidies, potential predatory trade practices, and whether foreign-built turbines could be exploited for security vulnerabilities.

Officials from the Bureau of Industry and Security have so far refrained from commenting on the reasoning or scope of the review.

Part of Broader Offensive Against Wind Energy

The decision comes just days after the administration raised tariffs on steel and aluminium for hundreds of products, including wind turbines, with new duties of up to 50 percent.

President Donald Trump has been vocal and loud in his opposition to renewable energy expansion, walking the talk over the past few weeks.

On Truth Social this week, he criticised wind and solar projects as “destroying farmland” and vowed to halt any federal approvals for them. Since taking office, Trump has already paused permitting of all wind projects on federal lands and waters and indefinitely halted new offshore wind lease sales.

Heavy US Dependence on Foreign Imports

The investigation could have significant implications for the domestic clean-energy sector, as the sector is highly dependent on influence.

According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, the US wind industry relies heavily on imports for blades, drivetrains, and electrical systems. In 2023, wind-related equipment imports totalled USD 1.7 billion, with 41 percent sourced from Mexico, Canada, and China.

Tariffs are unfair, and our representatives should say so

Iowans who vacation in Las Vegas can see magician shows that feature distraction and sleight of hand. Here in Iowa distraction, and sleight of hand was practiced in an Aug. 17 Register guest essay by state Rep. Ryan Weldon and in comments by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn. Their ploy is to distract from the damage done by President Donald Trump’s tariffs. This damage is lower farm income and higher prices of Chinese goods to Iowans.

They distract by using the term “fair trade.” It implies Weldon and Nunn are experts in “fair” trade. What is “fair” trade? Before Trump tinkered with tariffs, we in the U.S. bought cheap goods from China. Chinese citizens subsidized the production of these cheap goods and put up with environmental damage. This made Chinese goods cheaper to us in Iowa.

Plenty of Chinese people, including my former Chinese students, must be angry about this subsidized production and environmental damage in China. But the Chinese, before Trump’s tariffs, enjoyed low prices on grain shipped from Iowa. These prices were low because our government subsidizes agriculture. Our prices are low also because farm environmental damage, especially water pollution, is pushed downstream to urban areas and onto future generations.

Before Trump’s tariffs, the governments of China and the U.S. argued but arrived at tariffs and balance of payments including exchange rates. Were these agreements “fair”? Each country had a different view on that. But, one thing is certain. Both countries prospered. Iowa prospered.

What seems clearly unfair are the tariff-driven higher prices paid by Iowans for Chinese goods and by Chinese citizens who buy our grain. Iowa’s politicians should focus on tariff unfairness instead of trying to distract us like the magicians of Las Vegas.

Republicans sign America’s death warrant by bowing to Trump

America's new message we must convey to the world: ""We're so very sorry!""

Not a single second passes where unrelenting human suffering shouldn't evoke America's heartfelt sympathies, accompanied by committed, truthful, responsive action. That, however, appears to no longer be the case in President Donald Trump's America. Truth, humility, and humanity are in short supply in a dictator's world.

Whether we're witnessing Trump's incoherent blaming of Ukraine for war criminal Putin's terrorizing murderous assaults and kidnappings, or Trump's racially based warrantless detentions and deportations, or the deadly devastating consequence of his cuts to USAID, or his endorsement of Gaza starvations, or any of the voluminous other grotesque Trump administration practices and policies, the intentional abandonment of America's principles is the root cause of our decline. For this, and much more, most of the world deserves an apology. Allies have been abandoned, enemies are being embraced.

Ever since taking office his second term, our convicted felon, twice-impeached, sexual predator, habitual liar, gerrymanderer in chief has only reinforced his disregard for the rule of law and the Constitution upon which our Country was founded. There are far too many irrefutable examples of Trump's anti-American conduct to list, but the real crisis, in truth, lies elsewhere.

The real crisis is found in the lack of courage of Republican Party sycophants who are so cowardly and intimidated by Trump's vengeance that they have sold their souls to their would-be king. Their One Big Beautiful Bill stands as a testament to their allegiance to Trump over country; their wholesale confirmations of unqualified, incompetent Cabinet officials demonstrates the same. The office of president of the United States has been co-opted for personal enrichment, vengeance, and ego. The office of president of the United States granted Jan. 6 criminals wholesale pardons. These honorable elected officials continue to sit idly by while presidential lawlessness reaches new heights.

First lady Barbara Bush sat on the Board of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. One of President George H.W. Bush's speeches is quoted in a Mayo exhibit. Regarding our nation, it reads, in part: ""America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle.""

It is past time for America to tell the citizens of the world that we apologize for all of the harms they are now suffering, we are truly sorry, and we will work diligently to Make America Principled Again.

Stop buying ethanol to stand up for clean water and property rights

Are you upset that the Iowa Legislature refuses to do anything about the pollution of our drinking water? Are you upset that the governor served her big donors rather than the public by vetoing the bill to control eminent domain for carbon pipelines? One thing you can do, in addition to voting out the culprits, is to boycott ethanol. Ethanol is driving both of those problems, and by refusing to use it you can express your displeasure with how corporate agriculture is impacting our lives.

Root causes of water problems goes unexplored

It’s mind-boggling to me that the Register continues to run seemingly a new story every day on Iowa's water quality without ever looking into basic facts, root causes and the main actors.

Where are the numbers on comparable metros or ag states and how are they addressing similar situations? Why are we not directly asking Des Moines Water Works why it didn’t keep up on infrastructure or expand capacity over the past 20 years? Water utilities’ payroll and political power have grown, but the last new treatment facility groundbreaking I'm aware of was in 2006, when I was living in the metro.

The place has exploded with development and growth since then. Where's the accountability, where are the questions for the leadership, what are they doing with all the rate increases? We all know there won't be any answers or responsible adults looking out for us in the Iowa House or the Polk County supervisors' boardroom, we know that much.

So let's just run another story to keep everybody scared and nervous and talking about “water quality” with generic references to agriculture and the laughable lawn watering ban without addressing the underlying causes and the publicly paid actors who could and should be working on it.

Democrats seem unbothered by certain billionaires

In his recent Des Moines Register interview, Democratic senatorial aspirant Josh Turek shoehorned in liberal boilerplate castigation of ""billionaires.""

Of course, when Democrats like Turek inveigh against billionaires, here are ones they never cite: George Soros, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Mark Cuban, Jeff Bezos, and Reid Hoffman.

Why not? Because those and others of their ilk bankroll woke progressive Democrat and anti-American causes dear to Democrats' hearts.

I'll believe Turek's and Democrats' rhetoric re: wealth when they rail against those men, by name, instead of cashing their campaign contribution checks.

Public officials seek permission to discriminate

I am weary of people like former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis who feign religious persecution to defend an absurd belief system, for what? So they can discriminate against others, as Davis did in declining to issue marriage licenses for same-sex couples.

I once listened to a lecture from a Holocaust survivor, and she stated that all people need is permission. The law is the only thing keeping some of us from becoming savages. I worry for my LGBTQ friends, and now President Donald Trump is targeting homeless people. If I know my history, it won't stop there.

If your belief system can't survive without an enemy or a scapegoat, perhaps it's time to choose again.

Housing is inadequate in smaller Iowa communities, too

Rekha Basu’s July 27 column highlights the struggles of working citizens in Des Moines who cannot afford housing despite full-time employment. Decorah, a small but well-developed Iowan town, faces similar challenges.

According to Northeast Iowa Community Action Corp., there are only about three low-income housing complexes in Decorah, while the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 7.7% of the town's 7,454 residents live below the poverty line. This leaves a portion of qualifying residents without a place to live. Young professionals, such as recent graduates from Luther College or those starting at the local hospital, also struggle with rent. Local Realtors state that one-bedroom apartments can cost $800 to $1,000 per month, which eats a significant portion of someone's income.

This situation reflects Basu’s observations in Des Moines, where full-time workers struggle to afford housing. Decorah shows how the affordable housing crisis extends beyond just large cities in Iowa. Small communities also face challenges to keep their residents housed. To address these gaps, the city must support rental assistance programs, expand housing options, and challenge mindsets that limit new development.

Just like Des Moines, Decorah needs more resources to advocate for the community to ensure there is a sustainable future in housing.

Why don’t clean energy tax credits lower my bill?

The July 22 story “Will Big Beautiful Bill raise your energy bill?” repeats an estimate from the Energy Innovation Policy and Technology that ”Iowans will pay $350 more for energy in 2025 because of the Big Beautiful Bill.”

This increase is due to the repeal of certain energy tax credits, along with domestic sourcing requirements again according to the Energy Innovation Policy and Technology. The story also refers to a comment by MidAmerican Energy that the credits are critical for keeping costs down.

The story then states that Energy Innovation Policy and Technology group says phasing out clean energy tax credits will hamper electricity generated in the United States. (I assume they mean clean energy.) Later the piece says that an analysis (no source is reported) “expects Iowa to lose wind and solar capacity by 2035. That could force utilities to rely more on natural gas, at higher prices, which they are expected to pass on to consumers.”

First, when hasn’t an increase, or decrease, in natural gas prices been passed on to consumers? Second, MidAmerican Energy, for one, has received $10 billion in credits to build the clean energy projects it currently has. Just because the money/credit comes from the state and federal government doesn’t mean it is free.

Those $10 billion in creits amounts to about $3,200 for each user in the MidAmerican system. Yet my energy bill goes up, not down. Where’s my share of this credit? Are we paying for this infrastructure twice? Once in the governmental subsidies and secondly in our bills for infrastructure? Third, wind and solar energy are not currently reliable on a 24-hour basis so we have to pay for a dual system so we can have energy at night. “Clean energy” needs a backup. The natural gas plants are and will remain that backup. Therefore, the price of the backup is already included in the “clean energy” package.

Matthew Gannon, Davenport

Iowa seems intent on avoiding spending on food assistance

Thank you for the Aug. 10 editorial exposing the flaws of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ Healthy Kids Iowa program. As the piece makes clear, Healthy Kids Iowa is a poor replacement for Summer EBT because it serves fewer than 10% of the families previously helped, the monthly pickup system is inconvenient for providers, difficult or impossible for families without transportation, and it limits participation by Iowa farmers. The entire programs seems designed not to work, but to avoid spending money on food-insecure Iowans.

When I visited the governor’s office with advocacy groups last month, I mentioned a refugee family that lives 4.5 miles from the distribution site with no transportation. I was told about “Healthy Kids Direct,” a little-known program that mails shelf-stable food — not the fresh items provided at pickup sites. It’s not listed on Iowa’s Department of Health and Human Services website, doesn’t meet federal guidelines, and is funded not by the feds, but entirely by the state. DHHS staff told me it’s very small and unlikely to expand — perhaps by design.

Pair this with added work requirements, and the result is fewer families receiving help and more children going hungry. That’s the opposite of “Healthy Kids.”

Thomas Rendon, Des Moines

Cut air and vehicle travel if we’re serious about climate change

An Aug. 10 guest essay addressed climate change and its threat to the future generations of America.

The author does not offer any suggestions of how to reduce carbon emissions, so I will offer two suggestions.

Do you remember when due to COVID-19 there was limited airline travel? Do you remember that when there was no airline travel the CO2 levels in the atmosphere dropped by 30%? Since most airline travel is a discretionary life choice, why not raise the cost of airline travel to the levels of the 1950s and 1960s, so that we can eliminate this needless insult to our fresh air.

They say that it is every American's dream to own a home. I say that every American dreams of owning a car. Therefore it only makes sense that all immigration should be reduced or eliminated in an effort to hold stable or even reduce the number of energy-guzzling vehicles on the road.

So if we are really serious about our future generations, then we have to also get serious about our national debt crisis. So why don't we forget politics and work together to insure a bright future for the upcoming generations of Americans.

Donald C Parsons, Sioux City

Iowans’ anger about water pollution is not abating

The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to remove seven stream segments from the Iowa impaired waters list is a leap backward for public health and environmental quality. These segments, including parts of the Des Moines, Raccoon, Cedar, Iowa and South Skunk rivers, are known to have nitrate levels well above the drinking water threshold of 10 mg/L.

When nitrate flows unchecked into surface water, an undue and expensive burden is placed on water utilities or homeowners to ensure drinking water is safe.

In a time when Iowans are more concerned than ever about water issues, EPA’s tone-deaf decision rings hollow. This summer, Central Iowa Water Works imposed a first-ever lawn watering ban because of high nitrate levels. Almost 900 Iowans showed up to learn from the scientists behind the Central Iowa Source Water Research Assessment. Over 700 Iowans requested Nitrate Watch monitoring kits just this summer. Iowans are paying attention. Our waterways need more protection, not less.

Removing waterways from the impaired list doesn’t make water quality issues disappear – it only hides them. Iowans must stay vigilant and continue to hold leaders and polluters accountable. Based on the concern we’ve seen this summer, it’s clear that Iowans will continue demanding clean water.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

Ending clean vehicle tax credits will cause some taxpayers to lose federal tax credits.

Clean Energy Vehicle Credits End September 30, 2025

If you have been planning to buy a clean vehicle, you need to act soon if you wish to qualify for federal tax credits. Tax credits for both individuals and businesses are ending more than seven years earlier than they were originally scheduled to end due to One Big Beautiful Bill being signed into law. These tax credits now end September 30, 2025!

What Is a Clean Vehicle?

Per the IRS, a clean vehicle is one that gets plugged in (also known as an electric vehicle) or a fuel cell electric vehicle.

How to Qualify for the Tax Credit

Currently, if you buy a new clean vehicle for personal use, it can qualify you for the Clean Vehicle Credit. If you purchase a new vehicle, the credit is up to $7,500. Certain used electric vehicles can earn you a credit of up to $4,000. Tax credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your tax bill, so these are substantial savings!

To qualify for the credit, the vehicle must meet several guidelines. To see if your vehicle qualifies, you can go to fueleconomy.gov. Further, the following income thresholds must be met:

Income Limits and Maximum Price for New Vehicles

Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) in the year of delivery (or the year before delivery) is no more than:

$150,000 if single,

$225,000 if head of household,

$300,000 if married filing jointly

Vehicle cost no more than

$55,000 if a sedan,

$80,000 if an SUV, pickup, or van

Income Limits and Maximum Price for Used Vehicles:

MAGI is no more than:

$75,000 if single,

$112,500 if head of household,

$150,000 if married filing jointly

Vehicle cost no more than $25,000

Commercial Electric Vehicle Credit

In the case of businesses and tax-exempt organizations, the Commercial Electric Vehicle Credit allows a credit up to $7,500 for vehicles under 14,000 pounds, and up to $40,000 for vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds or more. There are no income limits or price caps for businesses to qualify, but there are several eligibility requirements that must be met. You can go to fueleconomy.gov to see if your vehicle qualifies.

Point-of-Sale Rebates

Instead of waiting to claim the tax credit when filing your taxes, you could have taken it at the time of purchase. This would have reduced the price you paid for the vehicle. You cannot have both a tax credit and a point-of-sale rebate for the same vehicle.

Takeaway

These federal tax credits end September 30, 2025, so you must purchase and take delivery of your vehicle by then.

Algiers, Algeria | Algeria has set forth a clear roadmap to anchor its ambition of becoming a regional leader in electric battery manufacturing, identifying three strategic industrial milestones deemed essential for the success of its Lithium–Iron–Phosphate (LFP) battery project.

The announcement followed a high-level meeting on Thursday between Belkacem Soultani, CEO of Sonaram, and Dr. Karim Zaghib, the renowned Algerian scientist whose expertise in energy storage technologies has gained international recognition.

Three Industrial Foundations

At the heart of the plan are three key operations:

Phosphate conversion units to produce phosphoric acid, a cornerstone of the LFP battery value chain.

Lithium ore processing and refining units to secure a reliable supply of raw material in line with global standards.

Iron ore purification from Gara Djebilet, specifically lowering phosphorus content to produce high-grade iron compatible with advanced industrial applications.

According to Sonaram’s statement, these pillars constitute the backbone of Algeria’s strategy to establish a self-sufficient and competitive battery ecosystem.

Scientific Diplomacy and International Cooperation

The project’s scientific dimension is being reinforced through joint research programs between Algerian universities, Université du Québec, and MERC at Laurentian University in Canada. The focus will be on developing innovative solutions to address high phosphorus levels in Gara Djebilet’s iron ore, a technical bottleneck whose resolution could unlock immense potential for Algeria’s metallurgical and battery industries.

Professor Zaghib, who has been working for six months with a multinational research team on iron purification techniques, stressed that “preliminary results are promising and open wide industrial horizons for Algeria.”

State-Level Support and Strategic Vision

The initiative follows the Memorandum of Understanding signed in April 2025 between Sonaram’s ORGM subsidiary and Prof. Zaghib. It has since gained momentum, with both sides agreeing to hold upcoming sessions with the Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Renewable Energies to accelerate regulatory frameworks and institutional mechanisms.

The government’s commitment is evident. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab have personally received Dr. Zaghib, underlining Algeria’s determination to support his vision and translate it into industrial reality.

Toward Energy Sovereignty and Green Transition

Sonaram emphasized that these measures reflect Algeria’s strategic will to fast-track the project, strengthen its position in global renewable energy markets, safeguard energy sovereignty, and pivot toward a knowledge-based green economy.

Dr. Zaghib has repeatedly affirmed that Algeria possesses the resources and know-how to build a homegrown electric vehicle industry while developing a broader industrial base anchored in rare minerals and clean energy technologies.

Trump's statement this week seemed to confirm industry fears that the Interior Department will block federal permits for solar and wind projects.
Engie's North American subsidiary, headquartered in Houston, will operate about 11 gigawatts of solar, battery storage and wind power by year end.
The price that Avantus charges for solar power has roughly doubled to $60 per megawatt-hour as interest rates and tariffs have increased over the years, said CEO Graham.
Artificial intelligence power crunch Fewer renewable power plants could increase the risk of brownouts or blackouts, Smith said.","President Donald Trump's attack on solar and wind projects threatens to raise energy prices for consumers and undermine a stretched electric grid that's already straining to meet rapidly growing demand, renewable energy executives warn.

Trump has long said wind power turbines are unattractive and endanger birds, and that solar installations take up too much land. This week, he said his administration will not approve solar and wind projects, the latest salvo in a campaign the president has waged against the renewable energy industry since taking office.

""We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,"" Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. ""The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!""

Trump's statement this week seemed to confirm industry fears that the Interior Department will block federal permits for solar and wind projects. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum took control of all permit approvals last month in a move that the American Clean Power Association criticized as ""obstruction,"" calling it ""unprecedented political review.""

The Interior Department blocking permits would slow the growth of the entire solar and wind industry, top executives at renewable developers Arevon, Avantus and Engie North America told CNBC.

Even solar and wind projects on private land may need approvals from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if, for example, a waterway or animal species is affected, the executives told CNBC. The three power companies are among the top 10 renewable developers in the U.S., according to energy research firm Enverus.

The Interior Department ""will not give preferential treatment to massive, unreliable projects that make no sense for the American people or that risk harming communities or the environment,"" a spokesperson told CNBC when asked if new permits would be issued for solar and wind construction.

Choking off renewables will worsen a looming power supply shortage, harm the electric grid and lead to higher electricity prices for consumers, said Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, that's active in 17 states. Arevon operates five gigawatts of power equivalent to $10 billion of capital investment.

""I don't think everybody realizes how big the crunch is going to be,"" Smith said. ""We're making that crunch more and more difficult with these policy changes.""

Uncertainty hits investment

The red tape at the Interior Department and rising costs from Trump's copper and steel tariffs have created market instability that makes planning difficult, the renewable executives said.

""We don't want to sign contracts until we know what the playing field is,"" said Cliff Graham, CEO of Avantus, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in San Diego. Avantus has built three gigawatts of solar and storage across the desert Southwest.

""I can do whatever you want me to do and have a viable business, I just need the rules set and in place,"" Graham said.

Engie North America, the U.S. arm of a global energy company based in Paris, is slashing its planned investment in the U.S. by 50% due to tariffs and regulatory uncertainty, said David Carroll, the chief renewables officer who leads the American subsidiary. Engie could cut its plans even more, he said.

Engie's North American subsidiary, headquartered in Houston, will operate about 11 gigawatts of solar, battery storage and wind power by year end.

Multinationals like Engie have long viewed the U.S. as one of the most stable business environments in the world, Carroll said. But that assessment is changing in Engie's boardroom and across the industry, he said.

""The stability of the U.S. business market is no longer really the gold standard,"" Carroll said.

Rising costs

Arevon is seeing costs for solar and battery storage projects increase by as much as 30% due to the metal tariffs, said Smith, the CEO. Many renewable developers are renegotiating power prices with utilities to cover the sudden spike in costs because projects no longer pencil out financially, he said.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends two key tax credits for solar and wind projects in late 2027, making conditions even more challenging. The investment tax credit supported new renewable construction and the production credit boosted clean electricity generation.

Those tax credits were just passed on to consumers, Smith said. Their termination and the rising costs from tariffs will mean higher utility bills for families and businesses, he said.

The price that Avantus charges for solar power has roughly doubled to $60 per megawatt-hour as interest rates and tariffs have increased over the years, said CEO Graham. Prices will surge again to around $100 per megawatt-hour when the tax credits are gone, he said.

""The small manufacturers, small companies and mom and pops will see their electric bills go up, and it'll start pushing the small entrepreneurs out of the industry or out of the marketplace,"" Graham said.

Renewable projects that start construction by next July, a year after the One Big Beautiful Act became law, will still qualify for the tax credits. Arevon, Avantus and Engie are moving forward with projects currently under construction, but the outlook is less certain for projects later in the decade.

The U.S. will see a big downturn in new renewable power generation starting in the second half of 2026 through 2028 as new projects no longer qualify for tax credits, said Smith, the head of Arevon.

""The small- and medium-sized players that can't take the financial risk, some of them will disappear,"" Smith said. ""You're going to see less projects built in the sector.""

Artificial intelligence power crunch

Fewer renewable power plants could increase the risk of brownouts or blackouts, Smith said. Electricity demand is surging from the data centers that technology companies are building to train artificial intelligence systems. PJM Interconnection, the largest electrical grid in the U.S. that coordinates wholesale electricity in 13 states and the District of Columbia, has warned of tight power supplies because too little new generation is coming online.

Renewables are the power source that can most quickly meet demand, Smith at Arevon said. More than 90% of the power waiting to connect to the grid is solar, battery storage or wind, according to data from Enverus.

""The power requirement is largely going to be coming from the new energy sector or not at all,"" so without it, ""the grid becomes substantially hampered,"" Smith said.

Trump is prioritizing oil, gas and nuclear power as ""the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said.

""President Trump serves the American people who voted to implement his America First energy agenda – not solar and wind executives who are sad that Biden's Green New Scam subsidies are ending,"" Kelly said.

But new natural gas plants won't come online for another five years due to supply issues, new nuclear power is a decade away and no new coal plants are on the drawing board.

Utilities may have to turn away data centers at some point because there isn't enough surplus power to run them, and no one wants to risk blackouts at hospitals, schools and homes, Arevon's Smith said. This would pressure the U.S. in its race against China to master AI, a Trump administration priority.

""The panic in the data center, AI world is probably not going to set in for another 12 months or so, when they start realizing that they can't get the power they need in some of these areas where they're planning to build data centers,"" Smith said.

""Then we'll see what happens,"" said the University of Chicago MBA, who's worked in the energy industry for 35 years. ""There may be a reversal in policy to try and build whatever we can and get power onto the grid.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107172309-1672339709035-gettyimages-1439762841-3760.jpeg?v=1752782443&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-08-24 10:03:28.540202

The restructuring takes a two-pronged approach: It will reduce electricity rates for residential customers by an average of 10%, or 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. But the change also introduces what’s called a base services charge of $24.15 on every monthly bill.

The lower rates are designed to encourage customers across the state to adopt electrification measures in their homes. Those include buying electric vehicles and replacing natural gas appliances with electric appliances, such as heat pumps and induction stoves.

The $24.15 base services charge covers the fixed costs of utility infrastructure, such as transformers, wires and meters, as well as customer service to deliver electricity to and from homes.

To a lesser degree, it also helps fund “public purpose programs” such as the California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) and the Family Electric Rates Assistance (FERA) that assist low-income customers in paying their power bills. Some 26% of SDG&E customers are enrolled in the CARE or FERA programs.

What does the change mean for a typical SDG&E customer?

It varies, according to how much electricity you consume each month, where you live (be it coastal, inland, mountain or desert climate zones) and whether you are on the CARE or FERA discount plans.

For example, a chart from SDG&E estimates that a typical residential customer living in the inland climate zone who uses 400 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a month (which is about average for SDG&E’s service territory) will have a bill of $175 under the new base services charge structure. That’s $4 more than before. CARE and FERA customers would see a $4 reduction.

If a customer in the inland zone consumes 600 kilowatt-hours per month, their new bill will be $269, or about $8 less than under the old bill structure. CARE customers consuming the same amount of electricity would see a reduction of $10 while FERA customers would see their bills drop $15.

But a low-usage customer who consumes 200 kilowatt-hours would experience a $14 increase in their monthly bill, from $84 under the old system to $98. CARE customers using 200 kWh would see a $1 increase and a FERA customer would see a $4 increase.

According to the complete chart, net increases and decreases to bills are generally the same for SDG&E customers across other climate zones and usage amounts.

How we got here

The changes came as a result of Assembly Bill 205, which passed under questionable circumstances at the end of the 2022 legislative session.

Supporters say the makeover is designed to help lower-income Californians hit by the state’s ever-rising utility bills. Critics disagree, saying the new template is counterproductive and adds to the financial burden faced by beleaguered ratepayers.

The California Public Utilities Commission, on a 4-0 vote in May 2024, spelled out the specifics of how AB 205 would be implemented by the investor-owned utilities the commission regulates — SDG&E, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.

The commission, known as the CPUC, insists the new billing structure does not generate new profits for utilities, saying it “simply reallocates existing costs” among customers.

“This billing adjustment that’s required by the Legislature is really, at its foundation, a key lever to propel us toward our decarbonization goals,” CPUC President Alice Busching Reynolds said on the day of the vote. She called the decision “a very incremental, but important step towards this decarbonized future.”

California has set a target to derive 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045 if not sooner.

Who is also affected?

Since the new rate structure relates to the costs of transmitting and distributing electricity, it will apply to customers enrolled in community choice energy programs across the state. That includes the two in the San Diego area — the Clean Energy Alliance and San Diego Community Power.

It also applies to customers with rooftop solar.

The overhauled rules affect residential utility customers only, not commercial or industrial accounts. It does not pertain to the natural gas portion of customer bills — only electricity.

Supporters and critics

“If you look at where the state is looking to go — towards space and water heating, appliances, electric vehicles — we expect (electricity) usage for the typical customer to increase over time,” said Adam Pierce, SDG&E’s vice president of energy procurement and rates. “So what this structure is really doing is helping modernize this billing structure that hasn’t changed in several decades (to match) what the new energy landscape in California is going to ultimately look like.”

SDG&E and the other investor-owned utilities have long called for creating a monthly base service charge.

“This is not a novel billing structure,” Pierce said. “This is utilized across the U.S. with many electric utilities, as well as other utilities here in California that are not regulated by the CPUC.”

For example, the $24.15 figure the commission landed on was largely based on the fixed charge the Sacramento Municipal Utility District — a government-owned power company not subject to CPUC regulations — imposes on its customers.

The California Public Advocates Office, the independent consumer watchdog arm of the CPUC, is one of the groups in favor of changing billing structure.

“It’s important to have what goes into customer’s bills more accurately reflect what actually drives utility costs,” said deputy director Michael Campbell. “Very importantly, it will reduce the cost of electricity so as customers increase their electric usage and shift away from gas, it will help encourage that policy shift we’re aiming for.”

Campbell said the 10% reduction in electricity rates will particularly help customers living in hot weather areas who have little choice but to run their air conditioners for long blocks of time during the summer, sending their electricity bills soaring. Those customers often have lower incomes than those with homes along the coast.

“Their household budgets can really get stressed if you’ve got a heat wave and you’re running your AC and there’s no respite at night,” Campbell said. “Your bill can change substantially, to more than $100 from one month to the next and if you’re living paycheck to paycheck … that can be pretty hard to adjust your budget when you get that unpleasant surprise when you open the bill for the previous month’s usage.”

But other groups say changing the billing structure is a bad idea.

“The problem is that there’s not a way to really know if folks are using a lot of electricity because they have an electric car that they’re plugging in … or they’re just running their AC all day long when they don’t need to be,” said Jenn Engstrom, state director of the California Public Interest Research Group, known as CALPIRG. “I understand there could be some benefit for people who are high-electricity consumers because they’ve decided to electrify their home, but it’s going to have that same benefit for people who are just wasteful.”

Engstrom pointed to SDG&E’s examples that show low-usage customers consuming 200 kilowatt-hours of electricity will see an increase in their monthly bills and said the change is misdirected.

“What we really want to see are efforts to actually rein in some of the overspending that the utilities are doing so that they don’t have to then put that back on consumers,” she said. “Their profit rates are some of the highest in the whole country. If we just work to lower those, that would be a huge potential for savings for consumers.”

When the CPUC voted, Commissioner John Reynolds (no relation to CPUC President Alice Reynolds), said the notion that the new system will discourage customers from energy conservation was “laughable.”

“California will still have … time-of-use rates that create incentives for efficiency and conservation during peak hours and also encourage moving your usage to cheaper times of the day,” he said.

SDG&E will introduce the new billing framework in the coming weeks and it will be reflected in customer statements starting in the October billing cycle.

Southern California Edison unveils its changes in November. A spokesman for Pacific Gas & Electric, citing “challenges” due to technical issues in its rollout, said PG&E’s changes will come in March.

It’s important to note that the new billing structure is the first iteration of AB 205. The CPUC will review how the plan is working and make adjustments, if needed.

“As part of this proceeding, we’ll be doing a lot of analysis, studying and reporting back to the commission about how this is working and what potential tweaks need to be made to make this more effective in the future,” Pierce of SDG&E said.

But critics say that leaves the door open for possible increases to the price tag on the base service charge.

“There’s nothing in what the PUC approved that prevents them from raising it next year to $50 or $100,” State Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, R-Santee, said when the change was adopted. “The PUC has unchecked power on this thing.”

The murky origins of the legislation

AB 205 passed through the Legislature under circumstances that could be described most charitably as opaque.

It zoomed through both chambers in Sacramento late in the 2022 legislative session as part of a massive omnibus, or “trailer” bill that ran 21,633 words and covered a host of other items.

Most of the floor debate focused on a section of the bill that created a strategic reliability reserve to be overseen by the California Department of Water Resources and the portion establishing a fixed monthly charge on residential electricity bills was overlooked.

AB 205 was later signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Once it moved onto the CPUC to work out the details, the size and scope of the base service charge became a subject of fierce debate because AB 205 originally called for setting the monthly fee based on the household incomes of customers.

SDG&E, for example, initially called for monthly charges as high as $128 and then revised the figure to as much as $73 per month for upper-income earners.

But questions about how to obtain and verify income data from customers — and potential net increases in some customers’ bills — put pressure on the CPUC.

Another thing to keep in mind is that these provisions only impact federal income tax.","The White House has been promoting the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) as a win for working Americans. While ""no tax on tips and overtime"" and auto loan deductions certainly sound like good ways to get ahead financially, tax advisors caution that the fine print contains several surprises that could trip up uninformed taxpayers.

As one tax professional we talked to says, the OBBB's new tax rules may not work the way you think.

""People may misunderstand the new tax deductions,"" says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert for TurboTax. She warns about strict limits, income caps, and looming expiration dates. Being unaware of these details could lead to a much smaller refund than you were expecting — or even an unexpected tax bill.

Here are seven things you should know to avoid a shock at tax time.

No tax on tips? Not quite

While President Donald Trump campaigned on ""no tax on tips,"" the text of the OBBB tells a slightly different story. Tip income isn't actually tax-free now, but the bill does offer a healthy deduction.

According to Greene-Lewis, ""The [tip income] provisions are deductions which will be reported at tax time, and your savings depend on your tax rate."" For example, if you earn $5,000 in tips and fall into the 12% tax bracket, the deduction saves you $600 ($5,000 x 0.12), but it doesn't reduce your tax bill by $5,000.

The overtime deduction has a ceiling

Similar to the tip deduction, the new tax break for overtime pay is a welcome relief for hourly workers. However, there's a cap on how much you can deduct.

The new law only allows you to deduct up to $12,500 in overtime pay ($25,000 for joint filers). If you work significant overtime and earn, say, $20,000 in extra income, you'll still owe taxes on the $7,500 that's over the limit. Furthermore, as Greene-Lewis notes, the deduction ""is phased out with income over $150,000 ($300,000 for married couples filing jointly).""

The auto loan deduction is for new U.S. cars

The ability to deduct auto loan interest is back for the first time in decades, but it's not for every car buyer. This deduction is exclusively for the purchase of new vehicles assembled in the U.S.

If you buy a used car, a leased car, or a new car assembled outside the United States, you're out of luck. This detail could surprise buyers who assume any auto loan qualifies. The deduction is also capped at $10,000 in interest and, as Greene-Lewis points out, ""is phased out at income over $100,000 ($200,000 married filing jointly).""

Home energy credits are about to disappear

The Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the Biden administration, provided homeowners with a generous tax credit for making energy-efficient upgrades. The OBBB is ending this popular program.

""Homeowners should be aware that energy efficient credits for home improvements, like energy efficient windows and doors … will end for property placed in service after 2025,"" Greene-Lewis warns. If you're planning green upgrades, start now. You must have qualifying items installed and in use by December 31, 2025, to claim the credit on your 2025 tax return.

The EV tax credit ends this fall

If you've been thinking about buying an electric vehicle to claim the lucrative tax credit, you need to act fast. The OBBB eliminates this credit for cars purchased after this quarter.

""The Clean Vehicle Credit is also eliminated … for EVs purchased after September 30, 2025,"" Greene-Lewis said. Waiting for end-of-year sales could be a costly mistake, as you'll miss out on a credit worth up to $7,500 for a new EV or $4,000 for a used one.

The home office credit is back (and limited)

The OBBB reinstated the home office deduction for self-employed and small business owners, a victory for the many who live and work from their own homes. However, a fairly strict set of rules still applies. To qualify, you must use a part of your home exclusively and regularly for your business.

This means the dining room table you work from during the day and eat at with your family at night does not qualify. The IRS is very strict on the ""exclusive use"" test, a fact that could come as a shock to many who were expecting a new tax break.

The SALT cap increase has an expiration date

Homeowners in high-tax states rejoiced when the OBBB increased the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000. Now, they can deduct more property tax and other local levies. In the fine print, however, you'll find that this extra relief is temporary.

In fact, the provision is set to expire at the end of 2029. Starting in tax year 2030, the cap will revert to the old $10,000 limit unless Congress acts to extend it again. With no guarantees, long-term financial planning is a bit more difficult.

Bottom line

If the new OBBB tax provisions teach us anything, it's that there's often a wide gap between the headlines and real-world benefits. Understanding the rules can help you prepare yourself financially.

""Taxpayers should treat these new rules like a 'check the fine print' agreement. The headline might promise a great deal, but the real value, and the potential pitfalls, are always in the details,"" Greene-Lewis said.

Another thing to keep in mind is that these provisions only impact federal income tax. You'll still owe federal payroll taxes on tips and overtime, and you may still owe state income taxes depending on where you live.

Under the Trump administration's 2025 policy rollbacks, renewable energy incentives have been dismantled, fossil fuel subsidies expanded, and grid modernization efforts stifled. These shifts have triggered a perfect storm: electricity prices have surged by 10% since January 2025, renewable project development has stalled, and the grid's aging infrastructure is buckling under the strain of surging demand. For investors, the dilemma is clear: how to navigate a market increasingly defined by volatility, policy risk, and the urgent need for resilient infrastructure. The answer lies in strategic bets on grid modernization, distributed energy resources (DERs), and methane mitigation technologies like Ambient Carbon.

Trump's Anti-Renewable Agenda: A Policy-Driven Shockwave

The Trump administration's aggressive deregulation has reshaped energy markets. By canceling clean energy tax credits, pausing federal land permitting for wind and solar projects, and freezing programs like the Solar for All initiative, the administration has stifled innovation and investment. The consequences are stark: 64,000 renewable energy jobs lost or paused, $33.87 billion in project investments abandoned, and a 74% projected increase in wholesale electricity prices by 2026. Energy Secretary Chris Wright's attempts to blame Biden-era policies ring hollow in the face of independent analyses showing that Trump's rollbacks are the primary driver of rising costs.

For investors, this policy-driven instability signals a need to pivot away from traditional renewable energy projects and toward sectors less susceptible to regulatory whiplash.

Aging Grid Infrastructure: A $1.1 Trillion Modernization Imperative

The U.S. grid is a 100-year-old system struggling to meet 21st-century demands. From 2023 to 2025, utilities have poured $178.2 billion into grid upgrades, with $1.1 trillion projected for 2025–2029. Transmission and distribution spending now account for 67% of utility budgets, driven by the need to replace 70% of grid lines and transformers over 25 years old. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's $73 billion in grid funding and the Grid Deployment Office's $14.5 billion in grants have accelerated modernization, but bottlenecks persist. Transformer lead times have doubled, and 2,600 gigawatts of generating capacity are stuck in interconnection queues.

Investors should prioritize companies involved in grid resilience, such as those deploying high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines, smart grid software, and microgrid solutions. These technologies are critical for managing renewable intermittency and ensuring reliability amid extreme weather events.

Surging Data Center Demand: A Hidden Grid Strain

Data centers now consume 4.4% of U.S. electricity, a figure projected to rise to 12% by 2028. The rise of AI, cloud computing, and digital manufacturing has driven this surge, with hyperscale facilities in Virginia and Texas consuming 176 terawatt-hours annually. As data centers become a top driver of electricity demand, their energy needs strain an already stressed grid.

This trend underscores the importance of distributed energy resources (DERs) like rooftop solar, battery storage, and demand-response systems. These technologies reduce reliance on centralized grids and provide backup power during outages. For example, energy storage spending jumped from $97 million in 2022 to $723 million in 2023, signaling a shift toward decentralized solutions.

Methane Mitigation: A $15 Billion Opportunity

Methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO₂ over 20 years, is a critical but overlooked investment frontier. Technologies like Ambient Carbon's satellite monitoring systems and feed additives for livestock are revolutionizing methane abatement. The Global Methane Pledge, signed by 155 countries, has spurred $80–90 million in R&D funding, while the Inflation Reduction Act's Methane Emissions Reduction Program offers financial incentives for operators.

Investors should target methane mitigation startups and established players in satellite monitoring, leak detection, and agricultural innovations. These technologies not only align with global climate goals but also offer near-term profitability, as captured methane can be monetized.

Hedging Against Volatility: A Strategic Investment Playbook

To thrive in this volatile environment, investors must adopt a dual strategy:

1. Grid Modernization: Invest in companies deploying smart grid infrastructure, energy storage, and microgrids. These sectors are shielded from policy shifts and are essential for grid resilience.

2. Methane Mitigation: Allocate capital to technologies like Ambient Carbon, which offer both environmental and financial returns. The Global Methane Pledge and IRA incentives create a favorable regulatory tailwind.

3. Distributed Energy Resources: Support DERs that reduce grid dependency and provide backup power. This includes solar-plus-storage systems and AI-driven outage prediction tools.

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Energy Future

The Trump administration's anti-renewable policies have created a market ripe for disruption. While rising electricity prices and regulatory uncertainty pose risks, they also highlight opportunities in grid modernization, DERs, and methane mitigation. By pivoting toward these resilient sectors, investors can hedge against policy volatility and position themselves at the forefront of the energy transition.

“We are pursuing recovery of the costs of running the Campbell plant in a proceeding currently before [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].
When burned in the huge 1.5 gigawatt plant, this coal emits about 7.7 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

Donald Trump has made several unusual moves to elongate the era of coal, such as giving the industry exemptions from pollution rules. But the gambit to keep one Michigan coal-fired power station running has been extraordinary — by forcing it to remain open even against the wishes of its operator.

The hulking JH Campbell power plant, which since 1962 has sat a few hundred yards from the sand dunes at the edge of Lake Michigan, was just eight days away from a long-planned closure in May when Trump’s Department of Energy issued an emergency order that it remain open for a further 90 days.

On Wednesday, the administration intervened again to extend this order even further, prolonging the lifetime of the coal plant another 90 days, meaning it will keep running until November — six months after it was due to close.

The move, taken under emergency powers more normally used during wartime or in the wake of disaster, has stunned local residents and the plant’s operator, Consumers Energy. “My family had a countdown for it closing, we couldn’t wait,” said Mark Oppenhuizen, who has lived in the shadow of the plant for 30 years and suspects its pollution worsened his wife’s lung disease.

“I was flabbergasted when the administration said they had stopped it shutting down,” he said. “Why are they inserting themselves into a decision a company has made? Just because politically you don’t like it? It’s all so dumb.”

The May 23 order and the latest edict, by the U.S. energy secretary, Chris Wright, both warn that the regional grid would be strained by the closure of JH Campbell with local homes and businesses at risk of “curtailments or outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety” without it.

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining,” Wright said in a statement on Thursday.

But Miso, the grid operator for Michigan and 14 other states, has stressed it has had “adequate resources to meet peak demand this summer” without JH Campbell and Consumers Energy had already set about making plans for life after its last remaining coal plant.

“What’s remarkable is that this is the first time the energy secretary has used these powers without being asked to do so by the market operator or power plant operator,” said Timothy Fox, an energy analyst at ClearView. “It shows the Trump administration is prepared to take muscular actions to keep its preferred power sources online.”

Wright — whose department has bizarrely taken to tweeting pictures of lumps of coal with the words “She’s an icon. She’s a legend” — has said the U.S. “has got to stop closing coal plants” to help boost electricity generation to meet demand that is escalating due to the growth of artificial intelligence.

The administration has also issued a separate emergency declaration to keep open a gas plant in Pennsylvania, although it has sought to kill off wind and solar projects, which Trump has called “ugly” and “disgusting.”

The president, who solicited and received major donations from coal, oil, and gas interests during his election campaign, has signed an executive order aimed at reviving what he calls “beautiful, clean coal” and took the remarkable step of asking fossil fuel companies to email requests to be exempt from pollution laws, again under emergency powers.

So far, 71 coal plants, along with dozens of other chemical, copper smelting, and other polluting facilities, have received “pollution passes” from the Trump administration according to a tally by the Environmental Defense Fund, allowing greater emissions of airborne toxins linked to an array of health problems. Coal is, despite Trump’s claims, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and the leading source of planet-heating pollution.

Trump has launched a “political takeover of the electricity grid” to favor fossil fuels, according to Caroline Reiser, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The result of this will be higher electricity bills, more pollution in our communities, and a worsening climate crisis,” she added.

In Michigan, the cost of keeping JH Campbell open is set to be steep. Consumers Energy initially estimated its closure would save ratepayers $600 million by 2040 as it shifts to cheaper, cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind.

Reversing this decision costs $1 million a day in operating costs, an imposition that Midwest residents will have to meet through their bills. It is understood the company privately told outside groups it fears the administration could keep adding 90-day emergency orders for the entire remainder of Trump’s term.

“Consumers Energy continues to comply with the [Department of Energy] order and will do so as long as it is in effect,” a company spokesperson said. “We are pursuing recovery of the costs of running the Campbell plant in a proceeding currently before [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. Timely cost recovery is essential.”

Should the Trump administration go further and force all of the U.S .fossil fuel plants set to retire by 2028 to continue operating, it will cost American ratepayers as much as $6 billion a year in extra bills, a new report by a coalition of green groups has found.

This would almost certainly be met by legal action — Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, has already filed a lawsuit arguing the “arbitrary and illegal order” to extend JH Campbell’s lifespan will unfairly heap costs upon households in the state.

Trump’s efforts may bear some fruit, with U.S. coal production expected to tick up slightly this year, although the longer-term trend for coal is one of decline amid cheaper gas and renewables. “The administration may slow the retirement trend although they are unlikely to stop it,” said ClearView’s Fox. “The economics don’t change, but the administration could be a savior for these plants at least while Donald Trump is in office.”

For those living next to and downwind of coal plants, there is a cost to be paid that isn’t just monetary. Tiny soot particles from burned coal can bury themselves deep into the lungs, causing potentially deadly respiratory and heart problems.

The closure of such plants can lift this burden dramatically — a recent study found that in the month after a coal facility was closed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2016, the number of childhood asthma visits to local hospitals declined by 41 percent and then continued to fall by about 4 percent each month.

The study shows “the closure of a major industrial pollution source can lead to immediate and lasting improvements in the lung health of the those who live nearby,” said Wuyue Yu, research co-author and postdoctoral fellow at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

For those living in the township of Port Sheldon, a mostly bucolic setting on the shore of the vast Lake Michigan, a pollution-free future beckoned once JH Campbell had been scheduled to close, with lofty plans for new parkland, housing and a battery plant touted for the site.

Now there is uncertainty. Last week, a few dozen residents and activists held a protest event next to the sprawling plant, which hummed and whirred in the summer heat, one 650-foot chimney puncturing the horizon, another, smaller flue striped red and white, like a candy cane.

Dozens of train cars full of coal, hastily procured after the plant’s supply was used up ahead of a closure that has been scheduled for four years, backed up in the sunshine. When burned in the huge 1.5 gigawatt plant, this coal emits about 7.7 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

“Trump is just trying to keep the money coming into coal companies as long as he can, I suppose,” said David Hoekema, who has lived a couple of miles from the plant since 2006 and has had to clean coal dust from his windows. Trump easily won this county, called Ottawa, in last year’s election, but Hoekema said even his staunchest conservative neighbors don’t want the coal plant.

“I’ve not met anyone along the lake shore who says, ‘Oh yeah, let’s keep this open’ — even the conservative Republicans are concerned about their health,” he said. “Republican ideology says local control is best, but the Trump administration is saying, ‘We don’t care what the hell states do, we will impose our order on them.’ I know there’s a lot of competition, but this would have to be one of their craziest decisions.”

The Department of Energy did not respond to questions about its plan for JH Campbell once its latest extension expires. The battle over the coal plant’s future has taken place to a backdrop of a scorching summer in Michigan, one of its hottest on record, with algal blooms sprouting in its lakes, both symptoms of an unfolding climate crisis.

“The talk in neighborhoods has been how hot it’s been this summer — my kid was prepared to be outside every day and it’s been so hot so often it’s been irresponsible to do that,” said Stephen Wooden, a Democratic state lawmaker who added that Michigan residents are also “pissed off” about increasing power bills.

“We’re seeing the impacts of climate change daily, it is impacting our state,” Wooden said. “And this is being caused by the continuation of outdated, expensive fossil fuels that Donald Trump wants to prop up.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/JHCampbell.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-08-24 13:03:10.710685

At the same time, Vietnam should promote green finance, through green credit, green bonds, and sustainable investment funds, to mobilize resources.
Ultimately, green industrial development is a transformative journey, demanding political will, societal alignment, and business leadership.","As climate change becomes an undeniable reality and global commitments to sustainable development grow more urgent, transitioning to a green industrial model is no longer a choice but a necessary step to secure a prosperous and resilient future for Vietnam. Strategic shifts in policy and investment are powerful engines for boosting national competitiveness, improving quality of life, and turning sustainability goals into tangible results.

Laying the groundwork

Fully aware of the importance of sustainable development, the Party and the State has issued a comprehensive set of strategic guidelines and policies. In Resolution No. 29-NQ/TW dated November 17, 2022, the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam identified digital transformation and green transition as core pillars of the country’s industrialization and modernization process for the 2021-2030 period with a vision to 2045.

Decision No. 1658/QD-TTg, issued by the Prime Minister on October 1, 2021, approved the National Green Growth Strategy for 2021-2030 and Vision towards 2050. The strategy sets out goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity per unit of GDP, to “green” key economic sectors, and to promote the circular economy.

Additionally, Decision No. 687/QD-TTg, dated June 7, 2022, approved the “Scheme for Circular Economy Development in Vietnam”, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by at least 15 per cent by 2030 compared to 2014 and to work towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Notably, the Prime Minister’s strong commitment at COP26 in 2021 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 marked a turning point, creating significant momentum for the entire political system and society to take action.

The Law on Environmental Protection 2020 provides a critical legal foundation, introducing for the first time regulations on the circular economy and sustainable production and consumption. The revised National Power Development Plan for 2021-2030 with a Vision to 2050 (revised PDP8), sets clear targets to accelerate the development of renewable energy sources (excluding hydropower) for electricity production, aiming for a share of 28-36 per cent by 2030. By 2050, the share of renewables is projected to reach 74-75 per cent.

In parallel, the government has introduced a range of incentive policies to support businesses in accessing preferential loans, upgrading technologies, and actively participating in the green transition.

Early progress and challenges

Following the implementation of supportive policies, Vietnam’s industrial development has witnessed positive progress. According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, industry has consistently accounted for over 30 per cent of national GDP during the 2020-2025 period. Within this, the manufacturing and processing industry remained the primary growth engine, making up approximately 80 per cent of the industrial structure. Vietnam has gradually asserted its position as one of Asia’s manufacturing hubs and has been recognized by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) as part of the group of middle-income industrial economies.

From 2021 to 2025, the country’s industrial sector has continued to expand, with the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rising at an average annual rate of some 6.3 per cent. In particular, the manufacturing and processing industry is expected to grow by roughly 7.1 per cent per year, maintaining its role as the main driver of industrial growth. Its contribution to total industrial output is projected to increase from 77.2 per cent in 2021 to around 80 per cent by 2025, and it accounts for nearly 85 per cent of total exports. The industrial sector’s average growth rate remains higher than the GDP growth rate. Its internal structure has also improved, with a gradual decline in mining and a robust rise in energy, manufacturing, and processing industries.

At the same time, the energy sector has undergone a positive structural shift, notably with the rapid development of renewable energy. By 2024, renewable energy accounted for 26.8 per cent of the country’s total installed capacity and 13.4 per cent of the primary energy supply. This has not only helped stabilize electricity supply for industrial production but also driven the sector’s evolution towards green industry.

Despite these encouraging results, the Ministry of Industry and Trade acknowledges several persistent challenges in Vietnam’s industrialization process. Specifically, though the manufacturing and processing industry has been identified as the engine of economic growth, its current technological level remains significantly behind that of a modern industrialized country. Many enterprises still rely on outdated technologies, resulting in inefficiency and environmental harm, and the industry’s competitiveness remains weak compared to regional peers. With a highly open economy, Vietnam’s manufacturing sector remains heavily reliant on imports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market.

Furthermore, domestic support industries remain underdeveloped, leading to a heavy dependence on imported components and raw materials. As a result, Vietnamese manufacturing enterprises often participate only in the lower value-added segments of the supply chain, such as assembly. Localization rates remain low across many products.

Leveraging momentum

While facing many challenges, several economic experts believe that Vietnam still has opportunities and momentum to accelerate the green transformation of its industrial sector. Major export markets such as the EU are increasingly imposing stricter environmental standards, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the Emissions Trading System (ETS), and renewable energy regulations, pressuring Vietnamese enterprises to adapt in order to remain competitive.

Importantly, a green transition also presents an opportunity to attract high-quality FDI, particularly in green technologies and renewable energy. At the recent “Asia-Europe Industry Cooperation Forum”, organized by the Vietnam Association of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (VAFIE), a representative from the Foreign Investment Agency at the Ministry of Finance affirmed that Vietnam is increasingly positioning itself as a vital link in regional and global supply chains. FDI inflows from Europe have been rising rapidly, with impressive growth from the UK (up 172 per cent), Poland (up 1,000 per cent), and Luxembourg (up 1,100 per cent). This reflects the positive impact of next-generation free trade agreements (FTAs) such as the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EUVFTA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

In its FDI attraction strategy for the coming period, Vietnam has made clear its intent to pursue selective investment, with a focus on quality, efficiency, innovation, and sustainable development. The government is encouraging projects that incorporate high technology, deliver substantial added value, generate positive spillover effects, engage with domestic enterprises, and are environmentally friendly. Key priority sectors include high-tech industries, semiconductors, renewable energy (LNG, hydrogen, and battery technology), logistics, industrial infrastructure, innovation, and digital transformation.

Turning green challenges into opportunities

To navigate growing challenges and seize the momentum of green transformation, experts emphasize the need for coordinated, forward-looking strategies.

The first step is to review and strengthen legal and policy frameworks for green growth, ensuring consistency and practical enforcement. Green goals should be integrated into sectoral and local development plans. At the same time, Vietnam should promote green finance, through green credit, green bonds, and sustainable investment funds, to mobilize resources. The government must offer incentives, financial support, and risk-sharing mechanisms, particularly in the early phases of green investment.

Building enterprise capacity and a skilled workforce is equally crucial. Businesses should be encouraged to invest in clean technology and innovation. Workforce development should focus on green skills, environmental management, and renewable energy. Stronger collaboration between public and private sectors can help form green supply chains and support circular economy models.

Vietnam should also deepen its engagement in global sustainability initiatives and attract international capital, technology, and expertise to accelerate its transition.

Ultimately, green industrial development is a transformative journey, demanding political will, societal alignment, and business leadership. Though challenging, this path offers Vietnam the opportunity to address climate and environmental issues, boost competitiveness, and shape a prosperous, sustainable future. A successful green transformation will be a defining milestone in the country’s development journey.",,N,,2025-08-24 14:00:50.871277

That’s why it matters that Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has opened an investigation into two powerful climate organizations: the Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) and the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). If you haven’t heard of them, you’re not alone. And yet, they are exerting influence and soft power over every Floridian.

Uthmeier is alleging these groups may be pressuring Florida companies into handing over proprietary business data under the guise of “environmental transparency,” and then using that data to shape investment decisions, scores and access to capital.

It’s an important move concerning an issue that has, for too long, lacked scrutiny.

CDP, a UK-based nonprofit, operates the world’s largest environmental disclosure system and sells services that help companies “improve” their ratings — while also offering positive media statements from its own executives, for a fee. Its scores are used by major financial firms like S&P Global, Bloomberg, and ISS to guide investment decisions.

SBTi, co-founded by CDP and the United Nations Global Compact, approves corporate climate targets and then refers companies back to CDP to report their progress. That cycle — validation, disclosure, scoring — creates a system where climate policy is increasingly dictated by non-governmental actors with no accountability.

Uthmeier has raised concerns that these organizations may have violated deceptive trade practices laws (and perhaps even antitrust statutes) by working in tandem with financial institutions to penalize companies that decline to participate.

This is what we see when efforts at the ballot box and legislative chamber fail — shift tactics to deploy beneath-the-surface influence and infect the business climate hoping nobody pays attention. It is nefarious and Floridians have good reason to pay attention.

For example, small businesses in Florida, like family-owned farms in the Panhandle or local manufacturers in Central Florida, are feeling the squeeze. These companies, already navigating tight margins, face pressure to comply with costly disclosure requirements or risk being blacklisted by investors and financial institutions influenced by CDP and SBTi scores. This can mean higher operating costs, reduced access to loans or lost contracts, directly impacting jobs and livelihoods.

In coastal communities, where tourism drives the economy, these opaque climate mandates could deter investment in local hotels and restaurants, raising prices for consumers and threatening the vibrant small-business ecosystem that Floridians rely on.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with companies voluntarily adopting any practice they believe to be in their best interest. It crosses a line when private or foreign groups coerce companies into disclosing sensitive data by scoring them publicly and affecting their access to capital.

That’s why Florida’s investigation matters. It will help ensure that no Florida entrepreneur is forced to engage in practices that jeopardize the health of their business, customers and shareholders.

At the same time, the new administration in Washington is shifting its focus away from politically motivated climate handouts and toward common sense environmental stewardship: protecting clean air and water without threatening jobs, innovation or national security.

In Florida, we have a lot at stake. From tourism and agriculture to real estate and transportation, nearly every sector of our economy feels the ripple effects of top-down environmental mandates. As the national conversation about climate and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) policies continues, it’s critical that states like ours ask the tough questions and protect consumers, companies and constitutional principles alike.

The climate cartel may operate in the shadows, but accountability begins in the sunlight. Thank you, Attorney General Uthmeier, for taking this fight on. Florida continues to lead the way.

This will be the last day to purchase a vehicle to claim the credit, which can be worth as much as $7,500 for new vehicles that qualify or $4,000 for used electric vehicles.

For example, if you buy an electric vehicle with an MSRP of $55,000, the tax break lowers the effective price to $47,500 and can make the purchase far more affordable. Importantly for electric vehicle manufacturers, the credits help EVs compete more effectively with mid-priced gasoline vehicles.

Obviously, with most vehicle manufacturers ramping up their EV strategies in recent years, this could have a significant effect. But will it be a demand-killer, or a temporary bump on the road to widespread EV adoption?

How will this affect EV manufacturers?

The short answer is: ""It depends."" For one thing, it's important to point out that the credit for new EV purchases doesn't apply to all vehicles. In order to be eligible for the credit, a vehicle must meet a few criteria:

It must be an EV or a PHEV (plug-in hybrid).

The vehicle must be manufactured in North America.

At least 50% of the vehicle's battery components must be produced or assembled in North America (to qualify for half of the credit).

At least 40% of the critical minerals in the vehicle's battery must be produced in the U.S. or one of the U.S.'s free trade partners.

The vehicle must have an MSRP below $80,000 if it's an SUV, or below $55,000 for a sedan, wagon, or hatchback.

The buyer of the vehicle must have adjusted gross income (AGI) less than $150,000 (single) or $300,000 (joint filers).

The point is that there are a lot of vehicles that don't qualify. For example, no vehicles from Lucid (LCID -3.11%) qualify, as the company's Air sedans are far in excess of the MSRP limit. No electric vehicles from BMW or Mercedes qualify, because they aren't made in North America.

In fact, there are only 20 new vehicle models that qualify, and even among those, many configurations won't qualify. For example, a Tesla Model X technically qualifies, but only with an MSRP of $80,000 or below.

Manufacturers who have EVs currently on the eligibility list for the new EV credit include:

Acura/Honda: 2 models

General Motors (GM 3.29%): 6 models

Stellantis: 2 models

Ford (F 3.44%): 1 model

Hyundai/Genesis: 3 models

Kia: 2 models

Tesla (TSLA 6.18%): 4 models

It's also worth noting that there's a ""leasing loophole"" that excludes leased EVs and PHEVs from many regulations. For example, if you lease a luxury EV that is too expensive to qualify as a purchase, you might still be able to use the credit -- until Sept. 30, that is.

Should EV investors worry?

The bottom line is that the potential effect of the tax credit's expiration varies by manufacturer. It could produce a sales dip, especially for the manufacturers listed above. However, the gap between the average cost of an EV and the average cost of a gas-powered vehicle has narrowed in recent years, so the manufacturers focused on producing affordable models could be OK.

Other automakers -- like Lucid -- won't be negatively affected at all. If anything, it could be a net positive for them, as the lack of available tax credits on lower-priced models could make some buyers consider luxury brands more than they otherwise would.

We're already seeing EV sales spike in anticipation of the credit's expiration. More than 130,000 new electric vehicles were sold in July, the second highest total for a single month ever, and 36,700 used electric vehicles changed hands, which was the highest number on record.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/829594/ev-charging-2024.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 09:03:34.419421

For now, the Revolution Wind saga exemplifies the tension between short-term policy whims and long-term energy needs, leaving developers in limbo as court battles loom.","The Trump administration’s abrupt halt to construction on the Revolution Wind offshore farm marks a dramatic escalation in its campaign against renewable energy initiatives. On August 23, 2025, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a stop-work order for the project, which is 80% complete and poised to power hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. This move, affecting a $1.5 billion venture led by Danish firm Ørsted and Eversource Energy, underscores President Trump’s longstanding antagonism toward wind power, which he has derided as unreliable and environmentally harmful.

The order cites a need for further review under executive directives issued earlier in the year, including a January 20 memorandum that temporarily withdrew all Outer Continental Shelf areas from offshore wind leasing. According to NPR, the project was on track to begin delivering electricity next year, generating enough power for 350,000 households while creating thousands of jobs in manufacturing and installation.

Policy Roots and Early Actions

Trump’s hostility to offshore wind traces back to his campaign promises, where he vowed to end such projects on “day one” to prioritize fossil fuels and reduce what he calls burdensome regulations. Upon taking office, he signed an executive order pausing new leases and permits, as detailed in a White House memorandum that initiated a comprehensive review of federal practices. This has led to widespread delays, with the Interior Department imposing new layers of political oversight on approvals, per reporting from The New York Times.

Industry insiders note that these actions extend beyond offshore wind, targeting solar and onshore projects as well. For instance, the administration has withdrawn millions of acres of federal waters from leasing and opened investigations into bird fatalities at wind farms, amplifying concerns among developers about investment viability.

Economic and Environmental Fallout

The Revolution Wind halt threatens significant economic repercussions, including the loss of over 2,000 construction jobs and disruptions to supply chains reliant on domestic steel and turbine components. Advocates argue it undermines state climate goals; Rhode Island officials estimate the farm would cut carbon emissions equivalent to removing 100,000 cars from roads annually. As The Guardian reports, governors from Rhode Island and Connecticut have vowed legal challenges, labeling the order a direct assault on clean energy progress.

Globally, this policy shift ripples through renewable markets. European investors, who dominate U.S. offshore wind, face heightened risks, with costs already 30% higher than in Europe due to regulatory hurdles. Posts on X from energy analysts highlight growing sentiment that Trump’s moves favor oil and gas subsidies, potentially inflating consumer energy bills despite pledges to lower them.

Industry Reactions and Legal Battles

Renewable energy firms like Ørsted have expressed frustration, warning that repeated halts erode investor confidence and could strand billions in sunk costs. The American Clean Power Association has criticized the administration for prioritizing ideology over energy security, pointing to data showing wind’s cost-competitiveness—unsubsidized onshore wind at $38–78 per megawatt-hour versus new gas plants at $48–107, as per a 2025 Lazard report summarized by Reuters.

Legal experts anticipate swift court challenges, with states arguing the stop-work order violates prior approvals and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Meanwhile, supporters like Congressman Jeff Van Drew praise the pause for protecting marine life and local economies from what they deem unproven technology.

Broader Implications for U.S. Energy Strategy

This episode fits into Trump’s broader energy agenda, which includes gutting tax credits for renewables via August 2025 Treasury rules, as noted in posts on X and coverage from HuffPost. Critics warn it could slow the U.S. transition to net-zero emissions, ceding ground to China in clean tech dominance.

Looking ahead, the administration’s review may lead to permanent bans or scaled-back leasing, but bipartisan support for renewables in red states—where wind powers 63% of Iowa’s grid—suggests political pushback. For now, the Revolution Wind saga exemplifies the tension between short-term policy whims and long-term energy needs, leaving developers in limbo as court battles loom.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-1c3778bb-281b-40d0-86ae-96ee461fc656.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 12:06:31.806802

For industry insiders, the key takeaway is clear: AI isn’t just augmenting battery tech; it’s redefining its possibilities.","In the rapidly evolving world of energy storage, artificial intelligence is emerging as a transformative force, accelerating breakthroughs in battery technology and charging systems that could redefine everything from electric vehicles to grid-scale power. Researchers and companies are leveraging AI to sift through massive datasets, predict material behaviors, and optimize designs at speeds unimaginable a decade ago. This isn’t just incremental progress; it’s a paradigm shift that’s compressing years of R&D into months, according to industry experts.

Take, for instance, the work at Microsoft, where AI models have identified over 500,000 potential new battery materials by analyzing chemical properties and stability factors. This computational prowess is slashing the time needed for discovery, traditionally a painstaking lab process. As detailed in a recent Fast Company report, such innovations are “supercharging” the race for longer-lasting batteries, with AI enabling simulations that predict how materials will perform under real-world stresses like extreme temperatures or rapid charging cycles.

AI’s Role in Material Discovery

Beyond materials, AI is revolutionizing battery manufacturing. Machine learning algorithms are now optimizing production lines, reducing defects and energy waste by analyzing sensor data in real time. A report from IDTechEx, published earlier this year, highlights how AI-driven automation is disrupting supply chains, forecasting a market growth to $19.4 billion by 2034 as per InsightAce Analytic’s analysis. This integration allows for predictive maintenance, where AI anticipates equipment failures before they halt assembly, ensuring higher yields of advanced lithium-ion and solid-state batteries.

In the realm of electric vehicles (EVs), AI is tackling one of the biggest pain points: charging efficiency. Companies like Tesla are experimenting with AI-optimized battery management systems (BMS) that dynamically adjust charging rates to extend lifespan and prevent overheating. Recent posts on X from industry watchers, such as those discussing Huawei’s patented solid-state battery with claims of 3,000km range and five-minute charging, underscore the buzz around these advancements, though experts caution that real-world scalability remains a challenge.

Enhancing Charging Infrastructure

Quantum computing’s intersection with AI is another frontier, as explored in a white paper from TCS on AI and quantum technologies shaping EV batteries. By simulating molecular interactions at unprecedented scales, these tools are uncovering alternatives to lithium, like sodium-based chemistries that promise cheaper, more abundant options. SciTechDaily recently reported on AI discovering materials that could obsolete lithium-ion tech, potentially revolutionizing energy storage with higher densities and faster recharge times.

Meanwhile, AI is making charging smarter and more adaptive. Virta’s blog details how AI predicts charger faults and balances grid demand, integrating with systems like smart grids to optimize energy flow during peak hours. This is crucial as data centers and EVs strain power infrastructures; X posts from analysts like Shay Boloor highlight companies such as Tesla’s Megapack for utility-scale storage, addressing AI-driven energy bottlenecks.

Sustainability and Recycling Gains

Sustainability is a core benefit, with AI enhancing battery recycling processes. Global Batteries notes that machine learning models analyze degradation patterns to recover materials more efficiently, reducing environmental impact. Batteries News covered a breakthrough where AI accelerated the discovery of new materials, cutting development cycles dramatically.

Looking ahead to 2035, IDTechEx forecasts significant disruptions in battery usage, from AI-optimized lifespans in consumer devices to grid-level innovations. Yet challenges persist: ethical AI use, data privacy in smart charging networks, and the need for robust regulations. As one X post from Dr. Singularity put it, AI could “solve all our problems” in battery science by enabling alternatives using abundant elements, but integration with existing infrastructure will determine success.

Market Implications and Future Outlook

The economic stakes are high. InsightAce Analytic projects an 18.9% CAGR for AI-driven battery tech through 2034, driven by collaborations between tech giants and automakers. GlobeNewswire’s report on integrated battery innovations mentions 34 new technologies released this year, with 17 vehicle models adopting them, signaling rapid commercialization.

For industry insiders, the key takeaway is clear: AI isn’t just augmenting battery tech; it’s redefining its possibilities. From faster material discoveries to intelligent charging, these advancements promise a more efficient, sustainable energy future. As Fast Company aptly notes, smarter AI is indeed supercharging innovation, positioning early adopters to lead in a post-lithium world.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-f7e56cac-93e3-4850-991a-fc24e3a26453.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 12:05:41.482004

Developed by a team of researchers from West Virginia University, the fuel cell can store and make electricity — the primary perk of fuel cells.
""This is how we achieve balance in a power grid that's evolving to incorporate intermittent, sustainable sources of energy,"" explained Liu.
The U.S. grid is incorporating cleaner energy, which could account for 93% of power plant construction in 2025.
This makes it promising for scaling, potentially supporting a cleaner power grid in the future.","Scientists are getting even closer to unlocking the full potential of hydrogen power with a new fuel cell design that can stand up to extreme heat and humidity, according to Tech Xplore. The breakthrough could help stabilize the modern power grid as it supports cleaner energy sources, like solar and wind.

Developed by a team of researchers from West Virginia University, the fuel cell can store and make electricity — the primary perk of fuel cells. But this new design can withstand the long-term heat and steam required for power generation that most can't do. It could help power systems move away from polluting fossil fuels, which are major contributors to heart and lung health issues.

The development and testing of the new fuel cell were detailed in Nature Energy. Ultimately, the team was able to run the fuel cell for 5,000 hours at 600 degrees Celsius, or more than 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. That far surpasses previous fuel cells, which researcher Xingbo Liu said previously ran stably for a maximum of 1,833 hours.

""This is how we achieve balance in a power grid that's evolving to incorporate intermittent, sustainable sources of energy,"" explained Liu.

The U.S. grid is incorporating cleaner energy, which could account for 93% of power plant construction in 2025. But with more renewable energy on the grid comes a mismatch between energy supply and demand. Solar and wind, for example, don't produce energy on a fixed schedule because sunshine and wind aren't constant.

That's why hydrogen energy from fuel cells is important. Hydrogen can store excess energy produced by these methods for long periods, keeping it available during lower generation times. Fuel cells can switch between producing and storing energy to smooth out those fluctuations. That's why they work so well with solar panels, which need support to power homes after dark.

This technology will be essential for a clean, reliable, and affordable grid as more variable renewable power comes online.

""We showed that it's possible to make, on a large scale, CCS [carbon capture and storage] fuel cells that will stay strong and stable under intense conditions,"" said Hanchen Tian, the WVU team's lead researcher.

Similarly, Rhode Island and Connecticut have pledged legal support for Revolution Wind, framing offshore wind as a non-negotiable pillar of energy security.
The Road Ahead: Caution and Opportunity The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads.","The U.S. offshore wind sector, once heralded as a cornerstone of the nation's clean energy transition, now finds itself in a precarious position. Political headwinds, regulatory turbulence, and economic pressures have collided to stall projects that were once seen as near-certainties. Yet, amid the chaos, a clearer picture is emerging of how investors can navigate this volatile landscape—and why the sector's long-term potential remains compelling for those willing to adapt.

The Perfect Storm of Delays

The Trump administration's aggressive stance on offshore wind has been a seismic shock to the industry. The January 2025 executive order halting new permitting and leasing, coupled with retroactive scrutiny of ongoing projects like Ørsted's $4 billion Revolution Wind, has created a climate of uncertainty. Revolution Wind, 80% complete and poised to power 350,000 homes, now faces a $9.4 billion funding gap after being forced to halt construction. This case underscores a broader pattern: federal policies weaponized under vague “national security” justifications, such as claims of “exclusive economic zone interference,” have left developers scrambling for clarity.

Economic factors compound these challenges. Inflation, high interest rates, and pandemic-driven supply chain bottlenecks have inflated project costs, forcing companies like Ørsted, Equinor, and Shell to take massive impairments. Meanwhile, the collapse of tax credit programs under Trump's July 2024 megabill has left developers without critical financial tools to attract private capital.

State-Level Resilience: A Ray of Hope

While federal policies have sown chaos, state governments are stepping in to fill the void. New Jersey's “transmission-first” strategy, for instance, prioritizes grid infrastructure to support its 11,000 MW offshore wind target by 2040. The state's approval of the Leading Light Wind and Attentive Energy Two projects, alongside the development of the New Jersey Wind Port, signals a commitment to building regional supply chains. Similarly, Rhode Island and Connecticut have pledged legal support for Revolution Wind, framing offshore wind as a non-negotiable pillar of energy security.

Maine's struggles, however, highlight the risks of overreliance on federal policy. The state's indefinite postponement of its offshore wind power purchase agreement—due to shifting federal priorities—has derailed its 100% clean energy by 2040 goal. These divergent state responses illustrate a critical lesson: resilience in the sector will depend on localized strategies that hedge against federal volatility.

Strategic Diversification: The Investor's Playbook

For investors, the key to long-term resilience lies in diversification—both geographic and technological. While U.S. offshore wind remains fraught with risk, European projects and complementary technologies like grid infrastructure and battery storage offer safer havens. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, though not a panacea, provides a lifeline through tax credits and incentives. Companies like NextEra Energy and Ørsted, which are leveraging IRA benefits to offset federal uncertainty, may emerge stronger.

Infrastructure-focused investments also present lower-risk opportunities. Transmission lines, port logistics, and marine research initiatives (like New Jersey's Offshore Wind Research and Monitoring Initiative) are less susceptible to political whims and offer steady returns. For example, the NJ Wind Port's development is already attracting ancillary industries, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.

The Road Ahead: Caution and Opportunity

The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads. While the Biden administration's 30 GW by 2030 target now seems unattainable (with current projections at 16.4 GW), the underlying demand for clean energy remains robust. Investors must balance caution with optimism:

Diversify Exposure: Reduce reliance on U.S. offshore wind by allocating capital to European projects or complementary technologies.

Leverage IRA Incentives: Prioritize projects that align with IRA tax credits to mitigate financial risks.

Monitor Policy Cycles: Stay attuned to potential shifts in federal policy, particularly if the 2026 election brings a return to pro-renewables leadership.

Support State-Level Innovation: Invest in states like New Jersey and Rhode Island, which are building resilient, localized energy ecosystems.

Conclusion

The U.S. offshore wind sector is no longer a sure bet, but it remains a vital piece of the global energy puzzle. Delays and cancellations have exposed vulnerabilities, yet they've also revealed pathways to resilience. For investors willing to navigate the turbulence with strategic foresight, the sector offers a unique blend of risk and reward—one that could redefine the future of renewable energy infrastructure. The question isn't whether offshore wind will succeed, but who will adapt fastest to the new reality.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-24 20:00:10.235994

With U.S. President Donald Trump's ""Made in America"" agenda and high tariffs on imports, more firms are choosing Texas as a U.S. base, insiders said.

Chen Shih-hsiu (陳世修), head of the Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in North America, said that most Taiwanese firms are clustered in Houston and Dallas. Major investments include GlobalWafers, Delta Electronics, and System Electronics.

Dallas is particularly attractive, Chen said, because of its diverse industries, strong supply chains, and location at the center of North America.

Tax-free trade under the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA) also adds to its appeal, he said.

Texas data shows Taiwanese firms have announced 15 projects in the state over the past decade, totaling nearly US$11.2 billion and creating 3,550 jobs.

Electronics giants such as Foxconn, Compal, Quanta, Wistron, and Pegatron have already set up operations in Texas, Chen said, adding that suppliers of screws and plastics are also considering entry, drawn by cheap land, strong transport links, and no state income tax.

Beyond manufacturing, Texas is gaining ground in AI and space technology. For example, Taiwan-based Phison Electronics is working with local partners to develop the world's first data center in space.

Houston is a hub for space industries, and storing sensitive data in orbit avoids geopolitical risks, Phison's U.S. chief executive Wu Tsung-cheng said, calling it a rare chance for Taiwanese firms to join America's cutting-edge technology industry development.

With Tesla, AMD, HP, and Dell already in Texas, Wu said the state is becoming a tech magnet despite uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy.

Still, costs are rising quickly. Texas accounts for 36 percent of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, but rapid growth has pushed up wages, housing, and property taxes.

""Salaries here are now close to California levels,"" warned Wang Rong-bang (王榮邦), head of Taiwan-based TECO Electric & Machinery Co.'s automation division.

Taiwanese companies aiming to establish a U.S. presence must adapt, said IntelliEPI Chairman Kao Yung-chung (高永中), as investing in the U.S. will always be more costly and take longer than in Taiwan.

President Lai Ching-te said the referendum on Saturday failed after fewer than 25% of eligible voters voted in favor of restarting the Maanshan nuclear plant. At a briefing on Saturday evening, Lai acknowledged the expectations of Taiwanese residents for power stability.

“Nuclear power’s safety is a scientific issue, and safety cannot be resolved by a single referendum,” Lai said. “If future technology is safer, less nuclear waste, and more accepted by society, we will not rule out advanced nuclear energy.”

The Maanshan facility was Taiwan’s last one in operation before it was closed in May. While Saturday’s failed referendum helps cement the ruling party’s goal of phasing out nuclear power due to safety concerns, there is an ongoing atomic renaissance for the rest of the world as countries try to meet surging demand for stable, low-carbon power.

Without nuclear power, Taiwan will likely need to increase its reliance on imported fuel such as liquefied natural gas to meet the needs of energy-intensive sectors including chip manufacturing.

Proponents of atomic power have argued that turning Maanshan back on could reduce that dependence and ensure energy supplies, especially with consumption set to grow about 13% by 2030. It would also shore up energy security in the event of a military blockage by China, they said.

Ahead of the referendum, the chief executive officer of chip giant Nvidia Corp., Jensen Huang, highlighted Taiwan’s need for abundant cheap energy and touted nuclear power as an “excellent option” during a whistle stop trip to Taipei.

They’re developing bilateral climate partnerships with countries that understand the threat of the climate crisis and the opportunity that clean energy provides.
The first quarter of 2025 was the second-strongest ever for U.S. clean energy, representing $10bn in domestic investments.
To stay competitive, meet rising energy demand, stop utility bills from soaring, and tackle aging infrastructure, we need more clean energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency, not less.
Clean energy is and must be our future.","Over the past decade, the United States has turned technologies into tools that strengthened our economy, delivered good-paying union jobs, cleaned up our air and water, conserved our precious natural resources, and saved families money all across our country. Yet now the country is choosing to cede that leadership, letting China dominate and control the clean-energy market across the world. It’s no surprise that people are scratching their heads, wondering what happened.

Our president is obsessed with fossil fuels. He wants to resuscitate what everyone knows is a dying coal sector while turning a blind eye to the health, environmental, and economic downsides of the climate crisis. Coupled with inconsistent threats of increased tariffs against virtually all our allies, he has isolated the US and amplified threats to global security.

The president’s giant budget bill, signed right before the horrific floods in Texas, North Carolina, and New Mexico, ignores threats to communities from escalating climate risks while it cuts healthcare, raises energy costs, and puts the safety of our loved ones in harm’s way. And the administration’s executive orders, Environmental Protection Agency announcements, and efforts to gut our federal workforce make it abundantly clear our federal leaders are not working for the American people.

But I have never been one to back down from a challenge, certainly not when it comes to protecting my kids and grandkids. And I am not alone. Millions of Americans across the country have no intention of letting this administration dictate our fate at home or abroad. We simply refuse to let this be the United States of America.

States and institutions are still fighting in court when this administration disregards science and weakens federal efforts to protect people and our environment. Folks are still listening and speaking up at neighborhood gatherings, town hall meetings, and public hearings on issues like the weakening of air, water, and power plant pollution rules that increase risks to families. They are still fighting for our lives, our communities, and our democracy.

States, cities, and local communities have authority to act boldly and work with industries to advance market innovation and install clean energy that creates jobs and lowers the cost of living for families. They still have clean vehicle fleets for cities to purchase and EV charging projects to pursue. They still have tax credits for solar, wind, and batteries. There’s more than a decade of geothermal and battery storage tax credits available for cities, schools, and health clinics, as well as many more clean energy opportunities we can and must grab.

California, the fourth largest economy in the world, ran on clean energy for 219 days last year. Florida built more large-scale solar infrastructure than California last year. Even in oil country, Texas is setting records for solar, wind, and battery capacity.

More than 40 states have green banks and clean energy financing institutions. Twenty-four states are committed to the goals of the Paris climate agreement. They’re developing bilateral climate partnerships with countries that understand the threat of the climate crisis and the opportunity that clean energy provides.

US leaders I have worked with for decades during international climate negotiations continue to work with colleagues in the United Nations, the European Union, India, China, development banks, and the private sector to identify policies and strategies that allow the world to mobilize capital for climate projects. Why? Because the cost of not investing in resilience and decarbonization is far too high.

Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies have given our country a seat at the global table. America Is All In, partnering with the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors, Ceres, and others, will be at the forthcoming UN climate negotiations in Brazil to showcase leadership on infrastructure, transportation, buildings, land use, and more that protects our communities and cuts pollution.

Mayors and governors will use this platform to inform negotiations, build new partnerships, and pursue creative financing for more projects at home, while US investors continue to explore opportunities to address the heartbreaking food and water challenges across the global south.

Eighty-four per cent of corporations are standing by their commitments to cut carbon pollution, and 37% are increasing their ambitions, according to PwC, because they know that climate solutions are good for business. The first quarter of 2025 was the second-strongest ever for U.S. clean energy, representing $10bn in domestic investments. Across the globe, investments in clean tech are slated to reach $2.2tn this year, twice the amount for coal, gas, and oil.

To stay competitive, meet rising energy demand, stop utility bills from soaring, and tackle aging infrastructure, we need more clean energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency, not less. These technologies are cheaper to build and operate than fossil fuels. Ninety-three percent of new electric-generating capacity this year is projected to come from solar, wind, and batteries, according to Trump’s own energy department.

Facts are facts. No matter how much the administration tries to prop up the fossil fuel industry, US states, cities, communities, businesses, and institutions know that the world is not as Trump defines it. Clean energy is and must be our future.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3836e7bd7c62757413a6dd34041f97c519b529d5/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3e5c87eebaec126fcdb450f9a6f02937",N,,2025-08-24 08:01:30.181361

And all because the president seems to have some kind of personal problem with wind turbines. The gravity of the situation has to be explained in terms even his voters cannot ignore.

When Trump says he’s not going to approve any new wind or solar projects and abruptly halts the development of renewables in the United States, he is slowing down the only realistic way to stabilize rising electricity prices in the face of growing demand for power from AI data centers. By cutting tax incentives with the grotesquely misnamed One Big Beautiful Bill, he is delaying decisions that were already underway.

Even if one doesn’t believe in climate science, there’s the obvious question of emergency preparedness. This year, hurricane season threatens to be more intense than ever: the combination of warming oceans and severe cuts to the NOAA and FEMA will create any number of perfect storms. People will die and others will be made homeless. As Hurricane Erin, the first major challenge of the summer, approaches, the ability to foresee and respond is reduced: fewer resources and personnel, less surveillance, more risks for everyone. How can anybody deny this? It’s like defaulting on insurance just as a tornado is coming.

At the same time, Trump will drive pollution levels up by exempting some coal plants from meeting even the most basic standards, as well as by stopping renewable projects on agricultural land, despite the fact that they occupy only 0.05% of the total, according to USDA studies; all under the cynical argument of “protecting farmers.” In reality, his policies are stripping citizens of clean air, cheaper energy and a stable economic future.

Real Clear Wire

Articles addressing energy and climate topics in The New York Times (NYT) increasingly include inaccurate data and false information. The problem is compounded by the paper’s failure to follow its own corrections policy when errors are called to its attention.

Readers look to the NYT to deliver well-reasoned and fact-checked information and analysis in areas where they are not themselves experts. However, based on my professional focus on data and analysis of energy and related environmental issues over the past 45 years, which includes White House and Department of Energy senior positions in the Carter, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, Obama, and Trump 45 administrations as well as work at leading universities and think tanks, NYT coverage of these subjects too often fails to live up to its own standards for accuracy and journalistic integrity.

As a lifetime reader of the NYT, the frequency of errors and a refusal to fix them raises doubts regarding the accuracy of information presented on other topics. Whether or not the problem extends beyond energy and climate, the NYT readership clearly deserves better.

Three recent NYT articles illustrate the problem: a July 22 article by Max Bearak, ostensibly reporting on remarks by UN Secretary-General Guterres’ on renewable energy; a May 26 article by Ivan Penn on competition between electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicles powered by internal combustion engine (ICEVs); and an April 23 column by David Wallace-Wells on the loss of cultural and political momentum for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These are considered in turn below, followed by some summary conclusions.

Max Bearak’s July 22 2025 article “U.S. Is Missing the Century’s ‘Greatest Economic Opportunity,’ U.N. Chief Says” (July 23 print edition).

The article opens with a review of UN Secretary-General Guterres’ remarks promoting renewable energy investment as both an economic opportunity and an environmental imperative. With deft mixing of quoted and unquoted words, Bearak reports that Guterres explicitly criticized the U.S. and other countries that follow its policies on fossil fuels. Though that may well be the Secretary-General opinion, that view is not borne out in the as-delivered transcript of his remarks.

The bulk of the article turns to a discussion of energy data and climate policy that attempts to explain why the current situation has arisen, noting that this material was “left unsaid” by Mr. Guterres. From this point forward the reporter’s own analysis seeks to establish that China, in contrast to the U.S., is constructively pursuing a green energy transition. Unfortunately, the article presents faulty and misleading data.

In seeking to highlight China’s constructive role the article states “Over the past decade, China has gone from a largely coal-powered economy to one that is deploying more renewable energy than anywhere else.” Growth in China’s production and deployment of a wide range of renewable energy technologies is indeed very impressive. However, data in the 2025 Statistical Review of Word Energy (a widely-respected source of energy data available online here), show that China is still largely powered by coal. In 2024 coal provided 58.1% of China’s total energy use (92.2 out of 158.9 exajoules), while in 2014 it accounted for 69.8% of China’s energy use (82.1 out of 117.6 exajoules). (FYI, 1 exajoule = 947.8 trillion British Thermal Units).Thus, coal still dominates in China’s energy mix, although coal use grew more slowly than total energy use over the past decade.

Following its discussion of China’s renewable energy progress, the article turns to energy use and production the U.S. and other rich countries. It incorrectly states that “Relatively wealthy countries like the U.S., Canada, Australia and Saudi Arabia are also the world’s biggest producers of fossil fuels.” Data in the 2025 Statistical Review show that China’s total production of coal, oil, and natural gas totaled 112.3 exajoules in 2024, 32% higher than that of the second leading producer, the U.S., which totaled 85.0 exajoules. Indeed, China’s production of coal (94.5 exajoules) alone exceeds the total fossil fuel production of any other country. Moreover, the 2024 data is no anomaly; China has been by far the world’s largest fossil fuel producer in every year since 2005.

Despite having contacted the NYT corrections team and the author to point out these errors, as well as the article’s mischaracterization of the temperature-related aim of the 2015 Paris Agreement, no corrections have been made to date.

Ivan Penn’s May 26 2025 article “Electric Vehicles Died a Century Ago: Could that Happen Again?” (May 27 print edition).

The article draws a parallel between the current competition between electric vehicles (EVs) and those with internal combustion engines (ICEVs) and the competition between them at the dawn of the automobile age. According to the article “scholars who have studied the earlier age of electric vehicles see parallels in their demise in the early decades of the 1900s and the attacks they are facing now. In both eras, electric cars struggled to gain acceptance in the marketplace and were undermined by politics.”

Actions taken since the start of the Trump Administration to eliminate EV subsidies and to modify mandates and regulations that would have forced very rapid rates of EV adoption do matter.These actions are widely expected to slow, but not stop, EV market share growth, compared to the outlook assuming a continuation of Biden-era policies. However, available data and research clearly refute the claim that the market extinction of EVs a hundred year ago can be attributed to lawmakers of that era having “put their thumbs on the scale — and coming out on the side of oil” by enacting a very generous oil depletion allowance in 1926.

The oil policy changes discussed in the article cannot have played a major role in the demise of EVs a century ago because EVs were already on their deathbed before they occurred. Data on vehicle manufacturing and registrations show that at least 98%, and possibly more than 99%, of the 17.5 million vehicles registered to operate in 1925 were already ICEVs. The article avoids recognizing that reality, which directly undercuts its line of argument.

The Department of Energy’s History of Electric Cars paper, prepared during the Obama Administration, specifically notes that the market share of EV sales peaked in 1899 and 1900 and declined thereafter, while the absolute level of EV production peaked in 1912 and declined thereafter. The early peaking of both EV market share and production occurred against the backdrop of explosive growth in both annual vehicle sales (from 4,200 in 1900 to 181,000 in 1910 and 3.74 million in 1925) and total vehicle registrations (from 8000 in 1900 to 459,000 in 1910 to 17.5 million in 1925). The History of Electric Cars paper also identifies the four major drivers of the EV decline in the early 20th century: improved roads, which favored ICEVs that could offer long range capability; oil discoveries in Texas that led to lower gasoline prices; the invention of the electric starter, which eliminated the need for a hand crank to start ICEVs; and mass production of ICEVs, which dramatically lowered their cost. The 1926 oil tax policy change does not make the list. Indeed, it is not even mentioned in the paper.

Federal policy can sometimes be a key driver of energy market outcomes, as has arguably been the case with the Price Anderson Act that enabled commercial nuclear power, the Natural Gas Act, and renewable fuel content mandates. That said, the fate of EVs a century ago shows that federal policies are not always a significant factor in market outcomes. Today’s EV advocates can draw solace from that point, since modern EVs have many positive attributes that should favor continued EV market share growth, and perhaps a future market-leading role, even with the recent removal of some policy stimulants.

David Wallace-Wells’ April 23, 2025 article, “The World Seems to Be Surrendering to Climate Change” (subsequently revised twice).

Wallace-Wells discusses the declining cultural and political momentum for ambitious action to limit greenhouse gas emissions in recent years, noting that this trend applies both domestically and globally.

In closing, the article observes that when climate advocates reckon with the loss of cultural and political momentum they often point to green records set each year. After reviewing some of these recent records and pointing out that a staggering share of global progress is taking place in China, Wallace-Wells notes that progress in the U.S. can be similarly breathtaking. It is here that problems in both the data cited and in the NYT corrections process are clearly evident.

In describing U.S. green energy progress, the original version of the article stated that electricity generation from renewables exceeded that from fossil fuels in 2024, which is woefully incorrect. Data readily available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration website and many other sources show that renewables provided 20% of 2024 US generation compared to 60% from fossil fuels.

The NYT did issue a correction, but the initial one it posted on April 25 claimed that monthly electricity generated by renewables in the U.S. exceeded the amount generated using fossil fuels for the first time in March. That updated claim was also wrong, as fossil generation substantially exceeded renewable generation in both March 2024 and March 2025. When this new error was called to its attention, the paper issued a further correction, still dated April 25, that now appears on its website. The final correction took an approach that is simultaneously misleading for readers and instructive regarding how hard the NYT strives to avoid issuing clear substantive corrections that may embarrass its authors or cast doubt on its preferred narratives. Rather than simply strike the original errant point or its errant replacement, which are not at all central to the main focus of the article, the second correction reframes it as a comparison between generation from clean sources and fossil fuels. The trick here is that “clean sources” evidently includes include nuclear generation, which provides roughly 20% of U.S. generation, to finally make the comparison valid. However, nuclear is not once mentioned in the article or in the final correction note, which even suggests that the original article was also comparing generation from clean sources and fossil fuels. The losers here are the general readers, who would likely assume that “clean sources” is simply a synonym for “renewables” and never know that they had been badly misled.

Conclusion

Unfortunately, I could go on – the three articles reviewed above are only examples of a larger problem that has been evident for some time.

The NYT, which has a very deep bench of staff who specialize in energy and climate matters, including the authors of these articles, must do better. Bearak should be able to correctly identify the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and coal’s continuing role as the dominant energy source in China. Penn should be able to recognize that history does not support the notion that EV developments today are repeating, or even closely rhyming with, the history of EVs a century ago. The temptation to craft tidy morality fable or reprise the origins dubious oil depletion policy first introduced in the mid-1920s that provided a huge windfall to the oil industry does not grant a license to posit a clearly invalid parallelism. The editors overseeing these articles also bear responsibility.

Finally, even when factual errors do slip into articles, a sound and well-implemented corrections policy can greatly mitigate the damage. The stated NYT correction policy that “when we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction” is sound, but its current implementation is atrocious. The so-called Grey Lady of journalism should be blushing in shame. The paper quickly corrects errors that are of minor importance to most readers, such as misspelled names, incorrect job titles, or inaccurate event dates. However, when substantive factual errors are identified and reported to the paper, as in the examples discussed above, its response is to either stonewall, as in the case of the Bearak article, or to obfuscate and evade, as in its correction of the comparison of renewable and fossil fuel generation levels in the Wallace-Wells article. In the latter case, the common observation that the cover-up is often worse than the crime clearly applies.

The NYT must always remember that the purpose of corrections is to inform the reader of what is actually true, rather than to protect its writers from embarrassment or protect preferred narratives that cannot withstand scrutiny.

The financial costs of climate-related disasters are escalating, with billion-dollar events becoming more common.

Extreme weather poses significant health risks, including heat illness, mosquito-borne diseases, and respiratory problems.

The EPA's proposed repeal of the endangerment finding threatens the legal framework for regulating climate-warming gases.

Congressional action is needed to defend the endangerment finding and protect public health and safety.

It’s no secret to anyone that extreme weather is on the rise here in Florida, around the nation and across the globe.

Pew Research Center recently found that 74% of Americans say they’ve experienced at least one form of extreme weather in the past 12 months.

Clearly, risks are increasing. Scientists and government data tell us that our warming climate is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense.

These are not natural disasters as we’ve traditionally labeled them. Rather, they are unnatural disasters because pollution from burning fossil fuels is warming the atmosphere at alarming rates and ratcheting up extreme weather.

The CLEO Institute just hosted a discussion on this increasing challenge with two experts on the topic. You can access a recording of the conversation by visiting bit.ly/extremeweatherontherise.

A fixture in South Florida news for decades, John Morales, now hurricane specialist at WTVJ NBC6 in Miami (having previously served as chief meteorologist), kicked off the discussion about his real-world observations from his perch as a meteorologist.

John — an honorary member of the American Meteorological Society — voiced concerns that budget cuts at agencies like the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put us all at risk by reducing our access to information. Plus, this is all very costly, since weather and climate disasters costing over $1 billion in damages have become regular occurrences in the United States.

The conversation shifted to the health risks from extreme weather with WebMD’s chief physician editor, Dr. Neha Pathak, sharing her insights. Dr. Pathak hosts WebMD’s Health Discovered podcast. She explained how the warming climate is increasing a host of health issues including heat illness, mosquito-borne diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular problems, asthma and allergies, just to name a few.

Given the financial and health burdens of the climate crisis, it is deeply disturbing that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on July 29 published a proposal to repeal the bedrock scientific determination — known as the endangerment finding — that carbon pollution threatens our health and environment. Without it, the federal government loses its legal authority to limit climate-warming gases like CO₂ and methane.

By ignoring science and dismantling the very tools that have kept our air cleaner and our communities safer, we are choosing vulnerability over security. This could mean more lives lost to extreme heat, more homes destroyed by hurricanes and floods, more forests or neighborhoods consumed by wildfires.

This is a direct attack on us and our future. It would make regulating climate pollution nearly impossible at a time when our communities are facing extreme heat, floods and rising utility bills.

Here’s the reality: We already have the knowledge, technology and capacity to protect people, strengthen our economy and lead the world in clean energy. Abandoning these tools is not just short-sighted, it’s dangerous.

Congress must act now to defend the endangerment finding, uphold the EPA’s mission and keep America safe, competitive and on the path to true energy independence. Our lives, our livelihoods and our place in the world depend on it.

The Public Service Commission approved the proposal with a 4-1 vote, allowing Entergy to move forward with construction of three natural gas-fired power plants to supply the massive facility. The decision was fast-tracked from its originally scheduled October date, reflecting the political and economic weight the project carries for the state.

The data center, located on a 2,250-acre state-owned site, will require approximately 2,500 megawatts of electricity—nearly three times the annual usage of New Orleans. This energy demand will increase Entergy’s electricity needs in the state by around 30%. Entergy plans to build two power plants near the data center in Richland Parish and a third in St. Charles Parish. The company argues that this approach ensures grid stability and avoids overloading the existing infrastructure, a common issue in other states where data centers simply add load to the grid without additional generation.

The project has drawn sharp debate over cost distribution and environmental impact. Critics, including the Louisiana Energy Users Group and the Alliance for Affordable Energy, have raised concerns that ratepayers may eventually shoulder some of the project’s costs. The new power plants are expected to cost around $5 billion, with Entergy also investing in a $550 million transmission line to support the facility. Opponents argue that the long lifespan of gas-fired plants—up to 40 years—poses a financial risk if Meta were to leave after its 15-year energy contract ends, potentially leaving ratepayers to cover operational costs.

Supporters, however, emphasize the economic benefits for a region that has long struggled with high poverty and unemployment rates. The project is projected to create 6,500 construction jobs and up to 500 permanent jobs once operational. Local officials, including Gov. Jeff Landry and regional economic development leaders, have welcomed the investment as a transformative opportunity for the area. Rob Cleveland of the economic development authority in northeast Louisiana described the impact as ""exponential growth"" for small businesses, already evident from early construction activity.

Meta has committed to developing 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in partnership with Entergy, though this provision is not legally binding. The company’s representative, Ashley Settle, stated that the location was chosen for its infrastructure, workforce, and grid reliability. Entergy’s CEO, Phillip May, added that the project will reinforce the state’s energy grid, create economic opportunities, and support a more sustainable energy future.

The approval process has been marked by secrecy and allegations of backdoor deals. Some key details, including energy load estimates and cost projections, were filed under seal by the administrative law judge handling the case. While Entergy insists these are commercially sensitive, opponents argue that the lack of transparency undermines public accountability. The Alliance for Affordable Energy has called for a delay in the vote, warning of potential grid reliability issues and environmental risks tied to the gas-powered plants.

Ultimately, the decision reflects a broader national trend of energy-intensive data center projects being supported by state governments in exchange for economic development promises. Louisiana’s approval sets a precedent for how large-scale AI infrastructure is being funded and regulated, with implications for future projects in the U.S.

China and Russia in May agreed to work together to complete a lunar nuclear reactor by 2036. In response, NASA’s interim chief Sean Duffy announced in August that the United States would fast track its lunar nuclear power program to have one ready by 2030.

But this sudden frenzy raises a few questions—such as why do we want nuclear reactors on the moon in the first place? And how would they work? To find out, IEEE Spectrum spoke with Katy Huff, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Advanced Reactor Fuel Cycles Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Huff previously served as the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

Why do the world’s biggest space organizations want nuclear reactors on the moon, and what would they power?

Katy Huff: There’s a growing interest in having a more sustained presence of humans on the moon for scientific discovery. Resources like helium-3, which can serve as a fusion fuel, may be part of the appeal. NASA is planning to build this kind of lunar exploration base through its Artemis program, and China and Russia are working together to build one called the International Lunar Research Station. Any such lunar base would absolutely need nuclear power. Renewables alone are too intermittent to meet the energy needs of life on the moon. Plus, the cost of getting things into space scales by mass, so the unmatched energy density of uranium fission is our greatest opportunity.

Why is it suddenly a race? What’s the urgency?

Huff: The momentum began with the fission surface power project at NASA, which a few years ago solicited designs for 40-kilowatt lunar microreactors. Three designs were selected and awarded US $5 million each. Since then, China and Russia have announced on at least three occasions a joint effort to design their own lunar microreactor with a launch target in the mid-2030s. In response, NASA is accelerating its timeline for the U.S. reactor to 2030 and increasing the target power capacity to 100 kW. Sean Duffy has said publicly that if China and Russia are the first to stake a claim for a lunar power plant, they could declare a de facto keep-out zone, limiting the United States’ options to site its base. So the U.S. aims to get there before China and Russia to claim a region with access to water ice, which aids life support for astronauts.

Designing Lunar Nuclear Reactors

What are the considerations for designing a nuclear reactor for the moon?

Huff: In very low gravity, fluids won’t behave exactly as they do on Earth. So the circulation patterns for the reactor’s fluid coolants will need to be recalculated. And the moon’s large temperature swings, which vary hundreds of degrees from lunar day to night, will require the reactor to use systems that are more isolated from those swings. On Earth we eject waste heat easily because there are thermally stable heat sinks like water bodies available.

What kind of reactor do you expect NASA to choose?

Katy Huff previously served as the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).Katy Huff

Huff: It would make sense if NASA chose one of the three designs previously selected for the fission surface power program, rather than starting from scratch. But with the over-doubling of target capacity, from 40 kW to 100 kW, there will be a bit of a redesign involved, because you don’t just turn up the knob. The three awards went to Lockheed Martin/BWXT, Westinghouse/Aerojet Rocketdyne, and X-energy/Boeing. Some of them are developing microreactors that are based around tristructural isotropic [TRISO] fuel, which is a type of highly robust uranium fuel, so I would expect the lunar reactor to be designed using that. For the coolant, I don’t expect them to choose water, because water’s thermal properties limit the range of temperatures it can cool effectively, which constrains reactor efficiency. And I don’t expect it to be liquid salt either, because it can be corrosive, and this lunar reactor needs to operate for 10 years with no intervention. So I suspect they’ll choose a gas such as helium. And then for power conversion, NASA’s directive explicitly said that a closed Brayton cycle would be a requirement.

What would transport and startup look like?

Huff: The reactor would be fully constructed on Earth and ready to go, with the fuel in place. My expectation is that it would be transported with the control elements fully inserted into the reactor to prevent a chain reaction from starting during transit. Once on the moon, a startup sequence would be initiated remotely or by the astronauts there. The control rods would then withdraw from the reactor, and a small neutron source like californium-252 would kick off the reaction.

A deadline of 2030 feels pretty rushed considering the United States doesn’t have a final design for the reactor, nor firm plans for a lunar base.

Huff: Right. That timeline does appear ambitious. We’ll have a hard enough time getting a reactor of this scale deployed as a prototype terrestrially in the next four and a half years. Getting one launch-ready and onto the moon by then is a recipe for eventually having to explain why we didn’t meet that timeline. And that could be a problem, reputationally, for nuclear energy more so than space exploration because people love NASA. Little kids and grown-ups alike wear NASA T-shirts. No one’s wearing DOE T-shirts.

Risks of Lunar Reactor Launch

What are the risks if something goes wrong with the launch?

Huff: Beautifully enough, fresh uranium fuel doesn’t present a radiological hazard the way spent uranium would. Only after it becomes the fission products is it significantly radioactive. So as long as the reactor doesn’t operate before launch, the hazard is quite low. Even if the fuel were dispersed over the Earth, it wouldn’t pose a significant danger to the people around it. I literally have a sample of uranium sitting by my desk. On top of that, there’s a robust launch safety protocol already established for any radiological object. NASA has a lot of experience with this from sending plutonium thermoelectric generators, which are more like a nuclear battery, for previous missions.

Things have gone wrong with some of the fission reactors previously launched into space; what happened to those?

Huff: The biggest fission reactors anyone has launched into space were the 5 kW electric TOPAZ-I reactors that were part of the Soviet program. One of them had a serious incident and broke apart. It’s now in high orbit in pieces, including some of its sodium coolant, which is just sort of floating around up there as liquid metal spheres. But that doesn’t impact the Earth because it’s a tiny amount of radiological source material at an incredible distance from Earth. The more unfortunate incident happened with the Soviet Kosmos 954 reactor, which, after operating in orbit, experienced uncontrolled reentry and disintegrated over a 600-kilometer swath of Canadian territory.

“What I meant by that is that we've made these (vehicles) political.” Strategic Vision’s research reflects that political divide.","GREER — When BMW Manufacturing decided to invest $1.7 billion to build electric vehicles in the Upstate, with plans to produce at least six fully electric BMW X models by 2030, it was a decision the company did not make lightly since BMW knows customers, especially Americans, like to have choices.

It’s a risk they’re betting will pay off. So are other automakers like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and Ford, which just unveiled plans for a midsize EV truck.

But the latest politics around electric vehicles have called into question the future of an industry that was just starting to take off.

This year, the Trump administration eliminated the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles, which ends Sept. 30.

A 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles and auto parts has strained most companies’ margins — although BMW has maintained an optimistic outlook, thanks to its production strategy in Spartanburg and aggressive product rollout.

Then there’s the political turmoil around EVs and the man who made them famous. Tesla CEO Elon Musk managed to ostracize both progressive and conservative consumers this year by aligning with — then maligning — President Donald Trump.

His public commentary and work with the DOGE commission, which slashed government spending, inspired an arsonist to toss a Molotov cocktail on a Cybertruck in Manhattan and some Tesla owners to don bumper stickers that said, ""I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy.""

Fewer people now are likely to purchase a Tesla, according to a new survey by market intelligence firm Caliber, which attributed that drop partly to Musk's polarizing persona.

Even with those setbacks, experts say EV demand isn’t going anywhere and that the market will slowly and steadily grow.

It just depends on where you look.

“While consumer demand for EVs and plug-in hybrids has been limited compared to what we've seen elsewhere globally, it's still ticking up,” said Joey Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina. ""Ultimately, it will come down to those price and convenience considerations,” he added.

BMW says tariff concerns are overblown

Thanks in large part to the flexibility of its global production network, BMW can meet demand for electric vehicles at any level, spokesperson Steve Wilson said in an email.

Most vehicles the German automaker ships across the world are made in Spartanburg County.

“In the meantime, we continue to follow our strategy of ‘technology openness’ where we offer our customers the freedom to choose a vehicle with the drivetrain that best suits their needs — fully electric, plug-in hybrid, or highly efficient combustion engine,” he added. “BMW has invested proactively in electrification, digitalization, our production network, and our products.”

Despite the squeeze from U.S. and EU tariffs, BMW is holding firm on its full-year financial outlook. CEO Oliver Zipse said tariff concerns were ""exaggerated"" in a recent company report.

Outside of China, BMW deliveries rose across all sales regions in the first half of the year, with the brand recording nearly 5 percent growth, according to the latest earnings reports. The company also reported “significant” growth in EV sales in the first half of 2025, nearly 19 percent.

One thing is clear: Electric vehicles are going to be a noticeable component of the automotive industry in the long run, which is good for companies like BMW, Von Nessen said.

There’s been steady growth in EV sales over the previous decade and overall growth in demand globally. That's been especially true in recent years as the cost of materials — including batteries — has declined, vehicle production has increased and infrastructure to support EVs has improved.

In China, for example, about half of all new vehicles that are sold are either EVs or plug-in hybrids compared to only about 10 percent in the U.S.

“It's not just about looking at what's happening in the U.S. in terms of changes in demand, but also what we're seeing on a global scale because South Carolina manufacturers are serving a global market,” Von Nessen said.

South Carolinians still slow to adopt EVs

The U.S. has been slower than some to embrace electric vehicles.

From 2019 to 2025, polling shows 51 percent of all new vehicle buyers in the U.S. reported no interest in an EV, while 28 were open to learning about it. Some 18 percent planned to research it in the future and 3 percent were actively looking for an electric vehicle as their next purchase.

The gap widens when you factor in political affiliation: only 30 percent of Democrats rejected an EV, while most Republicans did at 70 percent, according to research from Strategic Vision, a consulting firm that studies the psychology behind the car choices of about a quarter-million Americans a year.

“In 2019, I started sharing that whenever a political leader or policymaker talked about an EV or EV sale, a future EV intender died,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision. “What I meant by that is that we've made these (vehicles) political.”

Strategic Vision’s research reflects that political divide. U.S. car shoppers who are Democrats are more likely to prioritize environmental friendliness, gas or electric efficiency and vehicle safety features. Republicans want a vehicle with the best image, power and pickup.

In South Carolina, the numbers are similar, but with a little more initial rejection. Fifty-eight percent of car shoppers rejected EVs altogether from 2019 to 2025, while 26 percent were open to learning about them, according to Strategic Vision’s research. Fourteen percent planned to research it for their next purchase, while just 2 percent were actively shopping for a vehicle that has EV technology.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/45/145eb882-a6bf-4886-80eb-3854243d6fb1/63506ac44cd15.image.jpg?crop=1519%2C798%2C0%2C136&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-24 06:01:02.804665

However, the war in Ukraine has begun to challenge this status quo, and the tide may now turn, allowing US companies to assume a more dominant role in the region’s nuclear power sector in the long term.

As the European Union has turned decisively to the United States to diversify its gas supplies, it could do the same in the field of nuclear energy. This is also supported by the recent trade agreement, according to which the EU intends to procure US liquefied natural gas, oil, and also nuclear energy products, with an expected offtake valued at 750 billion dollars (about 700 billion euros) over the next three years.

In most countries of the CEE region, nuclear facilities are equipped with Russian-designed VVER reactors: Hungary’s Paks plant, Slovakia’s Jaslovské Bohunice and Mochovce, Czechia’s Dukovany and Temelín, Bulgaria’s Kozloduy, and Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and South Ukraine. Romania’s Cernavodă plant is based on Canadian CANDU technology, while the joint Krško plant of Slovenia and Croatia is the work of the US-based Westinghouse.

VVER reactors were supplied with fuel by Rosatom’s fuel manufacturing company, TVEL. However, after 2022, Slovakia, Czechia, Bulgaria and Ukraine began diversifying their fuel suppliers, with Westinghouse taking a leading position in this process.

Westinghouse fuels the region

In 2023, the company signed a long-term agreement with Slovenské elektrárne to license and supply VVER-440 fuel assemblies to its Nuclear Power Plants in Slovakia. It recently delivered the first batches of fuel to ČEZ for the Temelín and Dukovany plants, and is also supplying Energoatom for all of its nuclear reactors in Ukraine. It has a 10-year contract in Bulgaria, where they also delivered the first batch of VVER-1000 fuel for the Kozloduy nuclear power plant.

Westinghouse is also leading the Accelerated Program for Implementation of Secure VVER fuel Supply (APIS), a project funded by the European Union’s Euratom Work Programme 2023–2025. The APIS project aims to ensure a reliable supply of nuclear fuel for Russian pressurised water reactors (VVER) operating in the EU and Ukraine. The APIS 1 consortium consists of partners from twelve organisations in eight European countries, including MVM, the owner of the Paks plant.

The company could also build several nuclear plants in the region, potentially expanding Jaslovské Bohunice, Kozloduy, and Khmelnytskyi, and constructing Poland’s first nuclear power plant.

In Romania, American companies are participating in the expansion of Cernavodă, and the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) is also planned in the country, using NuScale Power technology.

Hungary opens the door to the US

Hungary has so far not joined this trend, and the EU has not prohibited imports of Russian nuclear fuel either, under the regulations restricting Russian energy imports, which currently apply to gas and oil.

At the same time, the country is not closing the door on American offers concerning small modular reactors (SMRs). These facilities may become increasingly important, as the expansion of the Paks plant is progressing slowly and facing delays, while the country aims to increase its energy production.

Paks II is now expected to be completed in 2032, two years later than previously planned. Additionally, Hungary plans to extend the operation period of the existing plant by 20 years, from 2023 and 2037.

This spring, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó and US State Secretary Marco Rubio discussed the possibilities for developing Hungarian-US energy cooperation, with special focus on nuclear energy. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó highlighted Westinghouse’s role in advancing small modular reactors (SMRs).

At the same time, Hungary signed an agreement with British Rolls-Royce SMR, which will provide small modular reactor technology capable of delivering up to 3 gigawatts (GW) of energy to ČEZ.

The latest development is that Hunatom, a member of the Paks II group of companies involved in nuclear technology development, has signed a letter of intent with Synthos Green Energy to use GE Vernova-Hitachi’s high-performance BWRX-300. As the minister Szijjártó noted, “The task is to ensure that, even under these circumstances, we can meet as much of the country’s energy needs as possible ourselves.” Meanwhile, GE Vernova is also expanding in Slovakia.

There are also other nuclear projects underway with the involvement of US companies. ČEZ has selected Amentum to support its new nuclear program by advancing plans for two small modular reactors (SMRs). Slovakia, together with the Czech Republic and Poland, will receive two million US dollars from the US-backed Phoenix project to finance a feasibility study of small modular reactors.

With this momentum, the US is making significant progress toward securing a larger long-term role in the region’s energy sector.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nuclear-power-plant-4535761_1920.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 08:00:22.621548

Another echoed, ""Come on Honda, bring us the electric Super Cub to the good 'ol USA and Canada!""","Honda's sleek new electric scooter, the CUV e:, is hitting markets with style.

Its six-kilowatt motor means it can hit speeds of up to 52 miles per hour, a zippy pace for the local urban and suburban roads it's meant for, according to Electrek. The scooter sports three ride modes, keyless ignition, storage space, and other nifty features.

""It's not flashy, but it's functional, well-designed, and undeniably useful,"" wrote Electrek.

One of its most innovative and attractive qualities is the swappable battery pack, allowing riders to keep one on the scooter while the other is charging, meaning you're never stuck waiting for a charge.

Honda's website states that the Mobile Power Pack (MPP) could even be shared universally via ""swapping stations on street-corner locations"" and that ""Honda developed the MPP while envisioning a future where people will enjoy their daily lives with clean and safe energy in abundant supply.""

While some might find fault with the EV industry for the pollution it admittedly causes during the production of its parts and especially its batteries — which require mining of rare-earth metals — EVs ultimately create much less damage to the environment than a traditional gas vehicle.

Data from the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and oil giant British Petroleum showed that over 16.5 billion tons of oil, coal, and gas are mined every year for traditional gas-guzzling machines.

Another study from MIT showed that over a car's lifetime, a gas-powered one releases 350 grams of carbon pollution as opposed to an EV's 200, and if that EV were charged with solar panels, it would be at or near zero.

Using solar panels to charge an EV battery would also bring the price of charging a car down to at or near $0. A company like EnergySage makes installation easy by vetting local companies and saving people up to $10,000.

The CUV e: will start selling in Europe and possibly then the U.S., which would be welcome news to some Americans looking to switch to EVs.

“Is this something that can change the profitability for electric vehicles, where they have obviously come up well short of what their earlier plans were?
“Is this going to invert the company, moving away from these very profitable vehicles and being mostly a provider of $30,000 vehicles?","President Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for electric vehicles and is slamming the brakes on government incentives to get them into more driveways.

He’s been working to undo policies that promote clean technologies while increasing support for coal, oil, and natural gas. In particular, Trump has been working to reverse or halt programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, the single largest US government investment to deal with climate change, signed into law by his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying a new electric car, along with a $4,000 credit for used EVs and $40,000 for commercial EVs, is set to expire on September 30.

Those moves may have contributed to Trump’s messy split with Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla and former head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted on Truth Social in June.

More than 90 percent of new cars sold in the US are still gasoline-powered, and EV sales have recently seen a slowdown in the US following a years-long growth spurt. The looming rollback of federal incentives, along with inflation concerns, rising manufacturing costs from tariffs, and increasing competition over raw materials, have led carmakers to cut back on many of the enticements that have made electric cars a better buy.

Many car dealers have also been struggling to move EVs off their lots as customers remain worried about charging infrastructure and cost.

But despite all of these challenges, the popularity of EVs in the US is still growing, and some US automakers remain committed to running on electrons. And in other countries, EVs are racing ahead. More than half of new cars sold in China are electric or hybrids, backed by generous government subsidies. People clearly are willing to drive EVs — at the right price.

Last week, Ford announced that it was pouring $5 billion into building a new EV platform — a chassis and drivetrain for a suite of electric vehicles — in Louisville, Kentucky. The first vehicle rolling off the line will be a four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000. That would put it in line with some of the cheapest pickup trucks on the market today, electric or gasoline. And Ford aims to start deliveries in 2027, less than two years from now.

It’s an ambitious, risky bet in a volatile economy, but it’s a sign that, while electric vehicles may be slowing down in the US, automakers think they aren’t stopping and could accelerate again. It’s also good news for anyone concerned about rising greenhouse gas emissions, since transportation is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world.

This isn’t Ford’s first run at an electric pickup truck. In 2021, Ford debuted the F-150 Lightning, the fully electric version of its iconic Ford F-150, the best-selling pickup truck in the US for almost five decades. At times, Ford was selling 100 conventional F-150s per hour.

So, it made a lot of sense that Ford would want to build on that successful platform to go electric. And at first, it seemed like their bet was paying off. Interest was high, and its initial production run for the 2022 model year sold out. The F-150 Lightning was named the 2023 MotorTrend Truck of the Year. Rivals at General Motors and Stellantis (the parent company of Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler) responded by developing their own electric pickups. But Ford ran into issues with its battery suppliers while the auto industry as a whole hit supply chain snags during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lightning sales quickly hit a pothole, and Ford even paused production for a few months last year.

At the time, I argued that the Ford F-150 Lightning was not the EV America was waiting for. It was too expensive to be the mass market truck that would tip American drivers away from gasoline and toward batteries. The base model Lightning launched at close to $40,000, and the current base model is almost $50,000.

The Lightning was another entry in the US auto industry’s general trend of moving upmarket with bigger, pricier, and more profitable vehicles. Carveouts in fuel economy rules for trucks and SUVs have also contributed to vehicle bloat in recent decades.

The average new car price in the US has reached a record high of almost $50,000 in a country where the median household income is around $80,000. Even pickup trucks, which evoke a burly, working-class aesthetic, are often kitted out and priced like luxury cars. That means a lot of Americans are borrowing to buy them. The average new car payment is $745, and auto loans are the second-largest category of household debt.

Electrification adds another cost. Though electricity is cheaper than gasoline, the average EV has a higher sticker price than its gasoline counterpart. For some automakers, like Tesla and Rivian, this is part of their strategy. First, start by building a high-end vehicle, creating the supply chains and charging network to support it. Then, after achieving economies of scale, start building cheaper vehicles. But so far, carmakers have continued to make more expensive models and have been slow to release cheaper EVs.

Public EV chargers are also nowhere near as ubiquitous as gas stations, and the ones available haven’t always been reliable. The Trump administration halted $5 billion in funding for more EV chargers, but after a court injunction, it began to release the cash.

“The top barrier for [EV] adoption is price, and then infrastructure,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

So, now, Ford is following a different route.

The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

Its bet on a $30,000 truck is an inversion of the start-expensive-then-go-cheap strategy, and the company argues it’s a return to form. “Nearly 120 years ago, the Ford Model T became the ‘Universal Car.’ Why? It was affordable, adaptable, and serviceable,” wrote Ford CEO Jim Farley recently. “Now, we’re ushering in the next chapter with the Ford Universal EV Platform.”

Alan Baum, principal of Baum and Associates, a market research firm focused on the auto industry, noted that this isn’t necessarily a shift for the company, but rather, a foray into the global market and an often overlooked swath of potential buyers at home that US automakers have largely ceded to foreign brands.

The customers looking to buy a cheap truck aren’t cross-shopping for a fully tricked-out F-150. And the growing cult of the Kei truck, a variety of tiny, cheap, lightweight gray-market Japanese imports, is an indication that there’s an unfed appetite for small utility vehicles in the US.

“Is this something that can change the profitability for electric vehicles, where they have obviously come up well short of what their earlier plans were? Yes,” Baum said. “Is this going to invert the company, moving away from these very profitable vehicles and being mostly a provider of $30,000 vehicles? Absolutely not.”

The other factor to consider is that, while the US is the land of big trucks, it isn’t the only place where people are buying them.

In the rest of the world, small, cheap cars are still in high demand. Some of the biggest growth markets are in places like southeast Asia, places with high gas prices, narrow roads, and a burgeoning middle class eager to get around. Inside the US, the government has used tariffs to keep Chinese electric carmakers like BYD off the interstate, but they’ve since become dominant in other countries. BYD is now the largest EV manufacturer in the world, while global EV sales are set to break new records this year and US carmakers are still trying to get out of the pit lane.

Meanwhile, massive markets like the European Union are still maintaining their environmental regulations, including a ban on the sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035.

So even with rollbacks of EV incentives and reversing regulations that promote cleaner vehicles in the US, carmakers are still facing a lot of pressure to make cleaner vehicles if they want to be competitive in the global market. And companies like Ford want to be competitive in the global market. The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

They’re also facing the added constraint of tariffs on materials like steel, aluminum, and rare earth metals. Ford said its new EV platform is aimed at exports as well as the domestic market and that critical components like batteries will be manufactured within the US without using critical minerals like nickel and cobalt.

The energy sector offers a useful parallel. Wind and solar power are now the main ways the world is adding more electricity to the power grid — not because of environmental regulations, but because it’s cheap and quick to get them up and running.

A lower price point is a stronger argument than any climate change bona fides. The words “environment,” “climate,” “carbon,” and “emissions” were conspicuously absent in Ford’s universal EV platform announcement. While the transition to cleaner vehicles is slowing, once EVs are cheaper and better than internal combustion cars, they will race ahead and take a commanding lead.

“The rest of the world’s going electric,” Valdez Streaty said. “I think we’ll continue to see that technology advancement, but definitely we have a lot of hurdles and bumps in the road right now.”",https://static.bundle.app/news/pc-c3a8af0faafcdf8a62d4f045eb406d1e.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 18:01:17.146585

At the time, the stated goal was that Chinese companies would control 80 per cent of the domestic markets of those industries by 2025.
Through patented breakthroughs, the Chinese companies made their batteries lighter, longer-lasting, faster to charge and cheaper to produce.
Ms Biqing Yang, an analyst at Ember, a global energy research organisation, created her own analysis of the European Patent Office’s data.","In 2000, Chinese applicants filed 18 clean energy patents that analysts said were internationally competitive.

In 2022, Chinese applicants filed more than 5,000.

Over two decades, China has leapt ahead of other countries, churning out innovative designs for the energy mix of the future: solar and wind power, batteries and electric cars.

Accused for years of copying the technologies of other countries, China now dominates the renewable energy landscape not just in terms of patent filings and research papers, but also in what analysts say are major contributions that will help to move the world away from fossil fuels.

“It may sound simplistic, but the ultimate indicator of patent quality is how much money a company or institution has spent on protecting its application, including by filing it in many countries,” said Mr Yann Meniere, chief economist at the European Patent Office, which shared the most robust data available on trends in competitive patent filings with The New York Times. “Purely based on that, we can see how China has gone from being an imitator to an innovator.”

The European Patent Office data considers any application that has been filed in two or more countries to be of high quality, based on the assumption that companies went through the trouble and expense of applying for a patent in more than one market with the intention of protecting their invention across borders. Patents prevent others from making, using or selling the innovation without permission for a specified period.

By that measure,

China applied for more than twice as many high-quality clean energy patents

as the United States in 2022, the most recent year of complete data. And while Chinese applicants continue to file a large number of lower-quality patents that may be duplicative or insignificantly different from existing inventions, a growing proportion is of higher quality.

That trend has been driven by strategic policies from Beijing as well as a maturing of China’s academic research environment.

“It is the opposite of an accident,” said Dr Jenny Wong Leung, an analyst and data scientist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which created a database of global research on technologies that are critical to nations’ economic and military security, including clean energy.

Last summer, leaders of the Chinese Communist Party who gathered to plan the country’s future paid more attention to scientific training and education than any other policy, except for measures to strengthen the party itself.

In mid-2015, the Chinese government announced a programme called “Made in China 2025”. It would provide companies in 10 strategic industries with large, low-interest loans from state-owned investment funds and development banks, assistance in acquiring foreign competitors and generous subsidies for scientific research. At the time, the stated goal was that Chinese companies would control 80 per cent of the domestic markets of those industries by 2025.

That effort has largely succeeded, Dr Wong Leung and other analysts said.

Chinese clean-tech companies have come to dominate both domestic and international markets. While Western countries like the US and Australia pioneered now-widespread technologies like solar panels, batteries and supercapacitors (which are like batteries, only smaller, and provide quick bursts of energy), China is now building on those designs and creating new, groundbreaking versions.

“The sheer volume of Chinese investment has been so much larger than in the West,” Dr Wong Leung said. “It meant they could build industries from the ground up, all the way through the supply chain.”

But it has not just been about money, analysts said. The Chinese government has encouraged cut-throat domestic competition that some economists have likened to “economic Darwinism”.

Mr Sam Adham, head of battery materials at CRU Group, a market analysis company, described a typical scenario: First comes a flood of subsidies into a particular industry that the government has deemed strategic. Companies pile in, filing dozens or even hundreds of patents along the way. In the final stage, Mr Adham said, the government pulls the subsidies and the less competitive companies essentially are “culled”, while “the remaining companies emerge stronger and they go overseas and take market share there”.

Take, for instance, batteries for electric vehicles. While the original breakthroughs in producing lithium-ion batteries were made in the US three decades ago, further research received little government backing there. Meanwhile, Chinese companies grabbed the baton.

BYD, based in Shenzhen, recently surpassed Tesla as the world’s largest manufacturer of electric cars, and CATL, a Chinese rival based in Ningde, produces the most batteries. BYD and CATL have both relied on lithium-ion batteries that use relatively inexpensive iron and phosphate, combined with lithium, rather than nickel and cobalt, which Western producers have favoured. Through patented breakthroughs, the Chinese companies made their batteries lighter, longer-lasting, faster to charge and cheaper to produce.

Those improvements are making electric cars safer and more convenient to drive, too.

A research team at CATL, which supplies batteries to electric automakers like Tesla and BMW, developed a way to minimise fire risk in car batteries that won a European Inventor Award in 2023. The series of patents, with unremarkable-sounding descriptions about battery covers and short circuits, amount to a major step forward in preventing catastrophic heat build-up and explosions when electric vehicles are overcharged.

China has nearly 50 graduate programmes focused on battery chemistry and metallurgy. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 65.5 per cent of widely cited technical papers on battery technology come from researchers in China, compared with 12 per cent from the US.

With its competitive advantage widening, China has sought to limit “technology leakage”, as some analysts put it. As of July, Beijing has restricted any effort to transfer out of China eight key technologies for manufacturing electric vehicle batteries, be that through trade, investment or technological cooperation.

“China has often done this unofficially in the past,” Mr Adham said, “but now it’s becoming written law.”

That would very likely cement China’s dominant role in producing batteries unless other countries invest similarly in research. Analysts said those moves make the global energy transition, which is central to efforts to limit human-driven climate change, ever more reliant on Chinese technologies.

Ms Biqing Yang, an analyst at Ember, a global energy research organisation, created her own analysis of the European Patent Office’s data. “If you take China out of the data,” she said, “there are even recent years where you will find that global innovation has stagnated or even slowed down.”

And she said that recent announcements from the Chinese government indicated it was nudging companies to look beyond solar panels and batteries to more nascent technologies.

“Carbon capture, smart grids, the electrification of heavy industry, those are the frontiers,” Ms Yang said. NYTIMES",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e5de39b771db73895c0045f534993e8e38d4af7a1b1319f1456f753314d145d7,N,,2025-08-24 04:58:01.107908

Chinese makers are already claiming a 10 per cent share of new car sales in the UK - and they are poised to dominate Britain's roads in the coming years, the study said.

Dominance of Chinese brands will be driven by their higher concentration of small, affordable EVs, which European and British car makers are currently overlooking, according to the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) and the FIA Foundation, the charity linked to motorsports' biggest governing body.

In itreport, it states: 'China, which now accounts for 27 per cent of global passenger car sales, has secured a competitive edge in manufacturing smaller EVs, with strengths across key aspects of EV production, including battery supply chains, manufacturing efficiency, and software.'

The study went on: 'It means China has evolved from a net importer of passenger cars before 2020 to the world's largest net exporter.'

It said European manufacturers - including car makers in Britain - are set to lose ground on their domestic market by overlooking the affordable EV market.

Instead, UK makers are steering towards premium models, with Jaguar set to release a £100,000-plus EV in the coming months, shortly after its sister brand Land Rover brings to market its first all-electric Range Rover, due to cost around £150,000.

Cheap Chinese cars are set to take over the car market as British and European makers continue to focus resources and output on premium SUVs, a new report has warned

Chinese makers are already claiming a 10 per cent share of new car sales in the UK - and they are poised to dominate Britain's roads in the coming years, the study said

The report says the 'shift in regional power balance' in the automotive market - very much in China's favour - is the result of changing market trends.

'Electric vehicles sold in most markets outside China have predominantly targeted larger vehicle size segments,' the study summarised.

'This shift towards SUVs and adoption of EVs has resulted in increasing average vehicle purchase prices, which has contributed to stagnation in new vehicle sales in high-income markets and an aging of their vehicle fleets.'

The report says European and British manufacturer have reacted to this demand by prioritising larger models, which 'offer automakers higher profit margins' but have a 'detrimental impact on vehicle affordability, negative impacts on road safety, and increase energy and material consumption, threatening environmental targets'.

It instead urged makers to pivot to smaller EVs like those produced by Chinese companies that will 'serve as a strategic response to these challenges'.

Chinese newcomers have already started to flood the market with affordable small models. One of the most impressive is the BYD Dolphin Surf, which starts from less than £17,000. That's around £8,000 less than a Vauxhall Corsa Electric

The Leapmotor T-03 is currently the cheapest EV sold in Britain, starting from £14,495

In contrast to these affordable small EV, JLR is on the cusp of launching its first all-electric Range Rover, which will cost in the region of £150,000

Steve Gooding, chief executive of the RAC Foundation, told The Telegraph that British drivers are already seeing the huge appeal of affordable, small electric models by snapping up those being sold by Chinese newcomer brands.

He highlighted the demise of the Ford Fiesta in 2023 - Britain's all-time best-selling car - as creating a gap in the market for more 'small, keenly priced EVs'.

Yet domestic car makers have pivoted to premium products, 'given the higher profit margins they tend to earn on bigger vehicles,' Gooding said.

It comes as Labour last month launched its new Electric Car Grant (ECG) aimed at increasing demand for more budget-friendly EVs.

The scheme offers taxpayer-funded discounts on some new electric models of up to £3,750 as part of an effort to kickstart sales.

It is tailored towards the less expensive end of the market, available only to sub-£37,000 models, which rules out many of the premium electric cars built in the UK and Europe.

However, it also looks to penalise Chinese brands by including sustainability targets that will rule of many of the new brands arriving in Britain in recent months.

In order to be eligible for the scheme, manufacturers must meet a designated threshold for emissions produced during the battery's manufacturing, the vehicle's assembly, and the 'carbon intensity' of the electric grids in the countries where the car is made.

A two-tier approach will see the greenest-made EVs qualify for the full Band 1 grant of £3,750, while those unable to meet the Government's highest standard will still get a discount of £1,500 at a Band 2 level.

However, many brands will be ruled out entirely.

MPs have stated that China's ongoing reliance on coal-powered energy would ultimately rule them out of the Government-supplied discounts.

Knowing this, many Chinese makers have instead launched their own discount schemes to match the value of that provided by the ECG to remain competitive on price.

UK roads could soon be dominated by Chinese brands will be driven by their higher concentration of small, affordable EVs, which European and British car makers are currently overlooking, according to the Global Fuel Economy Initiative and the FIA Foundation

As it currently stands, only Nissan is set to deliver smaller UK-made electric cars in the short-term future that will be eligible for the grant, which is running until 2028-29 thanks to a £650million backing.

It's new Leaf EV - set to start from around £30,000 and using batteries supplied by its neighbouring battery gigafactory - has just entered production and will be on sale later this year.

While other Nissan models not produced in Britain have already been confirmed as qualifying for the lower £1,500 Band 2 ECG, the Leaf is expected to be among those eligible for the full amount.

Nissan is also due to unveil a next-generation Juke EV, which will be an even cheaper compact SUV powered by British-supplied batteries. This is also likely to qualify for the full £3,750 saving.

Some 22 EV models (at the time of publishing) have been confirmed as qualifying for a Band 2 £1,500 discount, including the Renault 5 and Volkswagen ID.3.

EV experts have labelled the scheme an 'expensive mess', while retailers have said it has put the handbrake on electric car sales while customers wait to find out which models are eligible for discounts.

Even Mini could be set to miss out on the discounts.

Even the £27,000 electric Mini is set to miss out on Government's supplied discounts via the Electric Car Grant launched last month. This is because the EV version of the British icon is currently being produced in China as part of a deal with Great Wall Motor

Despite producing cars at its Cowley factory in Oxford for two decades, its parent group BMW has outsourced manufacturing of its all-electric Mini hatchback and Aceman crossover to China in a deal with Great Wall Motor (GWM).

Having previously committed to bringing production of electric Minis back to the Oxford plant in 2026, earlier this year BMW bosses announced they had put on hold plans to invest £600million into retooling the UK factory due to a slower than expected take-up of EVs.

They said they had paused its investment given 'multiple uncertainties facing the automotive industry'.

Yet the Mini's £26,905 starting price tag is £10,000 higher than that of rival-sized Chinese EVs, such as BYD's £17k Dolphin Surf.

Leapmotor's T-03, the smallest electric car on sale in Britain today, costs even less, currently starting from £14,495 after the Chinese brand reduced its pricing by £1,500 following the announcement of Labour's ECG.

Jack Cousens, head of roads policy at the AA, said 'budget-friendly' Chinese EVs have already secured East Asian brands a strong grip on the UK market - which they are destined to extend in the run-up to the end of the decade.

Some 19,000 of the 191,000 cars sold in the UK in the month of June were made by Chinese brands, including the likes of BYD, MG, GWM Ora, Jaecoo and Omoda.

And this success has seen Chinese brands extend their attention to larger family models to increase their stronghold on UK and European markets.

Cousens told the Daily Mail: 'MG, now Chinese owned, offers both small and larger EVs.

'Jaecoo, Xpeng and Genesis are doing well in the larger market.

'Look out for the Jaecoo J5 which is on the cusp of being released and looks like a Range Rover Evoque, but at a fraction of the price.'

AA president Edmund King added: 'There is no doubt that over the last twenty years the size of vehicles, whether petrol, diesel or electric, has grown in line with the popularity of SUV models where consumers seem to like the higher seating position and extra space.

'However, well designed smaller EVs, such as the Renault 5 and Mini electric range, have proved popular.

'There are now more than 130 EV models available in the UK, which are a mix of budget cars, family cars and SUVs. There are more than 33 new EVs with a price under £30,000, with more set to launch in the UK in the coming months and with Government grants applicable to this sector, we should see an increase in smaller less expensive EVs.'

The Department for Transport says the ECG aims to encourage uptake of small EVs.

A spokesman said: 'We're investing over £4billion to support both industry and consumers in making the switch to electric, giving drivers the confidence to choose the models that work best for them.

'This includes providing discounts worth up to £3,750 off the cost of a new electric car and rolling out more public chargepoints with 83,000 now available and over 100,000 more on the way.'",https://static.bundle.app/news/pc-be9e215a03e67c9dae414ee2e1956f22.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:05:56.024471

He referenced fresh evidence that the local administration had misrepresented its compliance with the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

According to Ramesh, officials have made false claims that ""(i) the rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 have been identified and settled; (ii) the consent of the affected tribal communities themselves has been lawfully obtained.""

Ramesh further wrote, ""It has been abundantly clear for some time that the project is simply being bulldozed through.""

According to a press release from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in November 20224, the decision regarding the development of the Great Nicobar Island project has been taken after careful consideration of potential environmental impacts on the island's ecology, as well as the significant strategic, defence, and national importance of the developmental projects.

According to the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, as amended periodically, prior environmental clearance is mandatory for all new projects and activities, or the modernisation of existing ones, listed in the notification's schedule. The process involves an assessment of project impacts and the preparation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) through stages such as screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal.

The release noted that multiple studies were conducted to assess the environmental impact and propose mitigation measures. These studies were carried out by prominent statutory and non-statutory bodies, including the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), as part of the EIA/EMP preparation.

An independent Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), comprising experts in science and engineering, conducted a detailed scrutiny of the EIA/EMP report during the project appraisal. The environmental clearance granted includes 42 specific conditions addressing each component of the project to safeguard marine and terrestrial biodiversity.

Three independent monitoring committees have been established to oversee the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan.

The Associated Press

When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.

“We thought absolutely, let’s do this right away,” said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.

These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven’t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.

The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer’s backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.

“We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” Dwyer said.

Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.

Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility’s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home’s circuit breaker.

Removing hurdles for plug-in solar

Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.

“The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. “It is clear that we are hitting a nerve — many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.”

Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they’re allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.

Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn’t understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.

Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility’s policy.

During the early days of plug-in solar’s growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“Utilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,” Cudd said.

This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that’s passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.

“Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here in the United States,” Ward said.

Bright Saver says they are lobbying other states for similar legislation.

Alexis Abramson, dean of the University of Columbia Climate School, also applauded Utah’s move.

“We actually need more localities, more states putting in allowances for this type of equipment,” she said.

Plug-in solar availability and savings potential

Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.

Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.

“I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,” he said.

He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.

Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.

“I think anyone can install this,” he said. “It’s not complicated. It doesn’t require a technical degree.”

Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company’s basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.

Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom’s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.

The company advises customers to notify their power company before installation, but it has “never had any pushback from any utility,” said Michael Scherer, one of the founders of Craftstrom.

China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.

“This is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,” Oliver said, adding: “As this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.”

The program will help bring EV charging stations to Eastern Oregon, which contains much of the state's roadways but has fallen behind in terms of charger access.","Oregon's plans to install several dozen electric-vehicle charging stations along its highways were once again full-speed ahead after overcoming legal and administrative obstacles to re-secure federal funding, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.

Originally granted by Congress in 2021, more than $40 million in funding for the charging stations was brought into doubt earlier this year amid changing policies at the federal level.

However, following a court victory in June and overcoming several other administrative hurdles, the funding was restored, according to OPB.

""There was a lot of speculation about what the status was going to be and whether Oregon was going to be able to secure the funds,"" said Brett Howell, transportation electrification coordinator for the Oregon Department of Transportation, per OPB.

""At the end of the day now for us, we do have that funding available to us,"" he continued. ""It is secure. We're going to be moving forward with this.""

Oregon has planned to build roughly 60 public charging stations, with each station including a minimum of four vehicle chargers. The DC chargers would be capable of charging a typical EV to 80% capacity in 20 minutes, according to OPB.

The charging stations were slated to be built along busy traffic corridors, including U.S. Highway 20, U.S. Highway 26, U.S. Highway 101, and Interstate 84, OPB reported.

The program will help bring EV charging stations to Eastern Oregon, which contains much of the state's roadways but has fallen behind in terms of charger access.

Building out vehicle-charging infrastructure is an essential component of transitioning society away from gas-powered cars and toward less-polluting EVs. Greater access to public chargers can give EV drivers more confidence to travel long distances in their vehicles.

Unlike gas-powered cars, electric vehicles do not release heat-trapping pollution or harmful particulate matter, benefitting both public health and the environment.

Plus, driving an EV can save up to $2,200 every year on fuel costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

However, the prevalence and easy access of gas stations in Oregon and across the U.S. remain some of the key advantages that gas-powered vehicles have over EVs.

As of this spring, roughly 88,000 electric vehicles were registered in Oregon, per OPB, but the state had only about 4,000 public and 300 private charging stations to serve all those EVs, per the DOE.

One key advantage that EVs have over gas-powered cars, though, is the ability to charge an EV at home.

To take the cost savings and environmental benefits of EVs even further, you can install solar panels on your home. Solar power can bring your electricity bill down to practically nothing, while also giving you the knowledge that your EV is being powered with cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes.
The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.
Green Oceans, a non-profit that opposes the offshore wind industry, and sued in federal court last year to stop the 83,798-acre (33,912-hectare) Revolution Wind project on environmental grounds, applauded the decision.
This is the second major offshore wind project the Trump White House has halted.","The Democratic governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut promised on Saturday to fight a Trump administration order halting work on a nearly complete wind farm off their coasts that was expected to be operational next year.

The Revolution Wind project was about 80% complete, with 45 of its 65 turbines already installed, according to the Danish wind farm developer Ørsted, when the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management sent the firm a letter on Friday ordering it to “halt all ongoing activities”.

“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests in the United States,” wrote Matt Giacona, the agency’s acting director, adding that Ørsted “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the project.

Giacona said that the project, which had already cleared years of federal and state reviews, now needs to be re-examined in light of Donald Trump’s order, on the first day of his second term, to consider “terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases”.

Giacona, whose prior work as a lobbyist for the offshore oil industry alarmed consumer advocates, also said that the review was necessary to “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States”. He did not specify what those national security concerns are.

Rhode Island’s governor, Dan McKee, criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut’s governor, Ned Lamont, “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind”, which was “just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes”.

Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, connected the decision to Trump’s reported pitch last year to oil industry executives to trade $1bn in campaign donations for regulatory favors. “When the oil industry showed up at Mar-a-Lago with a set of demands in exchange for a $1 billion of campaign support for Trump, this is what they were asking for: the destruction of clean energy in America,” Murpy said in a statement.

“This is a story of corruption, plain and simple. President Trump has sold our country out to big corporations with the oil and gas industry at the top of the list,” the senator added. “I will work with my colleagues and Governor Lamont to pursue all legal paths to get this project back on track.”

Since returning to office, Trump has taken sweeping actions to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Throughout his time in public office, Trump has repeatedly brought up his visceral hatred for wind power, apparently prompted by his belief that offshore turbines spoil the views at his golf courses, and his embrace of the bizarre theory that “the noise causes cancer”.

Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects.

Rhode Island’s attorney general, Peter Neronha, said in a statement on Saturday that, without the Revolution Wind project, the state’s Act on Climate law, which aims to use renewable energy to battle global warming, “is dead in the water”.

Scientists agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Ørsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24km) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51km) south-east of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19km) south-west of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the US and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

Green Oceans, a non-profit that opposes the offshore wind industry, and sued in federal court last year to stop the 83,798-acre (33,912-hectare) Revolution Wind project on environmental grounds, applauded the decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the non-profit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the Trump White House has halted. Work was previously stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, and senator Chuck Schumer intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,” Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

Email address Thank you!

As electric cars continue to gain ground all over the world, one of the big questions facing the industry is how to best repurpose the batteries powering those vehicles after they’re retired. It’s a question that doesn’t have a single correct answer, and so a number of startups have emerged in recent years with their own proposals. Some automakers are considering how to tackle this problem, too, and a solution that Toyota has been working on collects all kinds of high-voltage batteries, regardless of chemistry and degradation, and incorporates them all in a factory storage system. In fact, the company has just begun field testing one application at partner Mazda’s Hiroshima plant.

The Sweep Energy Storage System, as it’s named, takes reclaimed batteries from electrified vehicles—whether the cars they powered were pure electric or hybrids—and connects them to the power grid. The energy management logic Toyota has developed monitors and redirects energy flow in fractions of a second to prioritize healthy batteries and bypass underperforming ones.

Horizon, a publication focused on breakthrough science and technology in Asia, adds that the Sweep system also reuses the inverters from electrified cars, which negates the need for additional power conditioners and thus lowers costs.

Mazda’s Hiroshima campus is relatively self-sufficient, as it contains its own thermal and solar power stations. That makes it an ideal location for Toyota to install the Sweep hardware and realize the benefits it poses for Japan’s automakers. Mazda’s on-site power plant “generates a significant portion of the energy required” for the site’s day-to-day operations, according to the manufacturer.

Toyota and Mazda’s systems have been “connected through their respective energy management systems,” per a Toyota press release, and the nature of that relationship is explained in the handy visual aid you see below. “In the future,” the release reads, “the storage system will be used to regulate power supply and demand from renewable energy, which fluctuates depending on weather and time of day, contributing to carbon neutrality.”

Toyota and Japanese energy company JERA launched the first Sweep system in 2022, connecting it to the Chubu Electric Power Grid. According to Interesting Engineering, “the unit achieved a peak output of 485 kW and stored 1,260 kWh, enough to power over 1,200 homes for an hour.” The fact that the system, as designed, can tolerate used batteries of varying quality and chemistries makes it flexible. And flexibility in this case means practicality, which is critical for the uptake of recycling in any form.

The trend has become evident in recent weeks, in which two U.S. battery companies have taken over production sites in South Korea and Europe, betting on being close to customers in markets favoring green technology and renewable energy expansion.

First, it was California-based Lyten, which said in early August it would buy all remaining assets in Sweden and Germany of failed European battery firm Northvolt, which was Europe’s great hope to have a domestic giga-scale battery manufacturer.

But Northvolt in March filed for bankruptcy in Sweden, unable to overcome mounting challenges including “rising capital costs, geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, and shifts in market demand.”

A few months later, U.S. battery maker Lyten signed deals to buy Northvolt’s assets in Europe and is considering acquiring a Northvolt Six battery manufacturing facility under construction in Quebec, Canada.

In total, Lyten’s acquisition includes assets valued at approximately $5 billion, including 16 GWh of existing battery manufacturing capacity, more than 15 GWh of capacity under construction, the infrastructure and plans to scale to more than 100 GWh, and the largest and most advanced battery R&D center in Europe, in Sweden’s Västerås.

“The demand for European and North American made batteries is only growing,” Lars Herlitz, Lyten chairman and co-founder, said in a statement.

Lyten, whose investors and partners include FedEx, Stellantis, and Honeywell, currently manufactures lithium-sulfur batteries in Silicon Valley and is selling commercially into the rapidly growing drone and defense markets.

Upon close of Northvolt’s asset acquisition, Lyten plans to immediately restart operations in Skellefteå (Ett) and Västerås (Labs) in Sweden.

At Northvolt Drei in Germany, Lyten is working with Northvolt and the German government to continue the program to establish a battery manufacturing facility near Heide in Schleswig-Holstein, with 15 GWh of initial capacity.

Lyten plans to rehire a large part of the previously laid-off workers, while its collaboration with Northvolt’s prior anchor customers is progressing constructively.

“The acquisition of Northvolt’s assets brings the facilities and Swedish talent to accelerate this mission by years, just at the moment when demand for Lyten lithium-sulfur batteries is growing exponentially to meet energy independence, national security, and AI data center needs,” said Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and co-founder.

Resuming Northvolt’s operations would be a risky undertaking for Lyten, “but considering the current policy and demand climate, it makes sense for a predominantly US-based company to shift toward the European market,” said Connor Watts, battery raw material demand analyst at Fastmarkets.

While Lyten is pursuing large-scale battery manufacturing operations in Europe, another U.S. battery supply chain firm, battery materials manufacturer Group14 Technologies, is looking for growth in Asia, the world’s top battery manufacturing market.

Washington State-based Group14 Technologies this week closed a $463-million funding round led by SK, Inc. In addition, Group14 obtained full ownership of its joint venture with SK Inc located in Sangju, South Korea. Formed in 2021, the joint venture’s battery active materials (BAM) factory produces Group14’s flagship technology, SCC55, at EV scale to support the global battery manufacturing industry.

Group14 Technologies’ existing investors include Porsche Investments, ATL, OMERS, Decarbonization Partners, Lightrock Climate Impact Fund, and Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund.

Group14’s first and second BAM factories are located in Washington State. But the company is also expanding silicon battery infrastructure in Europe with a silane gas factory in Germany, which will supply a critical precursor for next-generation energy storage technologies.

“Strengthening regional supply networks and shifting to next-gen battery chemistries like silicon that reduce material dependency, is more than just risk management,” Group14 chief executive and co-founder, Rick Luebbe, told Techstrong IT earlier this month.

Commenting on the deal in South Korea, Luebbe said in a statement this week,

“We're strengthening regional battery supply chains and safeguarding our customers from global trade uncertainty.”

SCORE: 3.5/5 2025 Cadillac Optiq specifications","With Cadillac offering big price cuts and financing offers on its first Australian offering, the Lyriq EV – which some of us might have pointed out was too damn expensive when it was launched – it looks like the pricing of its entry-level offering, the smaller and undeniably more attractive Cadillac Optiq, is going to be hugely important.

Unfortunately, when EV Central flew to Detroit to drive the new mid-size Optiq on roads filled with slack-jawed yokels and Guns, Trump and God grandmas, the price was still a secret. And it remains so now.

2025 Cadillac Optiq price and equipment

When the Optiq does finally go on sale locally, you can bet Cadillac will be doing its level best to offer it at somewhere under $91,387, because that’s the LCT (Luxury Car Tax) exemption cut off point for EVs, and also about as much as you’d want to pay for one.

This, quite clearly, is the most important car in Cadillac’s three-vehicle range, and the one that has at least some hope of creating volume sales, below the Lyriq, the madly sporty Lyriq V and the large SUV, three-row Vistiq that’s available with only a six-seat layout in Australia, as opposed to seven in the US.

There’s no word on price for Australia yet, but in America you can get into an Optiq from as little as US$54,390, or $84K in our money.

While the Optiq will be the smallest Cadillac, it’s certainly not tiny, measuring 4820mm long, 2126mm wide and sitting on a 2954mm wheelbase. It’s 28mm longer than a Tesla Model Y, for example.

But the real competition it yearns to be compared with are the new BMW iX3 and GLC EV also landing in Australia in 2026. With both German giants throwing massive resource at these vehicles it’s going to be a tough fight for the Optiq.

But at least its size delivers it a solid starting point. It means there’s ample leg room in the rear, with a comfortable bench seat and a flat floor, plus two USB-C outlets and one power outlet. The boot offers a sizable 744 litres of storage, or 1603 litres with the rear seats folded down.

What impressed us most was the level of fit, finish and style up-front, with lots of pleasant materials (despite much of it being recycled materials) and a lovely blue colour scheme in the version tested, which, I should mention, also looks a lot more attractive on the outside then either Lyriq or Vistiq. It might just be the Goldilocks of the range.

As seems compulsory on all modern EVs, there’s a giant touch screen, measuring 33 inches, and it offers cool graphics and the ability to configure things just how you like them.

In terms of tech, US buyers have the option of choosing Super Cruise, which is a seriously capable autonomous driving system that Australians might get to experience a few decades from now.

The Optiq uses an 85kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt battery that offers range of 486km on the US EPA cycle.

The MY25 versions we drove were dual-motor all-wheel drive cars offering a not overly exciting 224kW and 480Nm. But the word is the MY26 variants, which would logically be the ones we’d get here next year (Cadillac Australia won’t tell us) have had power bumped up to a tastier 328kW and 675Nm.

Down the line, Cadillac should bring the Optiq-V, with a wild 387kW and 880Nm. Because every family SUV needs to be able to rip your arms off.

2025 Cadillac Optiq: What we think

So, what’s the Optiq like to drive and will it be worth the wait when it finally lobs down under in early 2026?

Well we can only base our opinion on the version we drove in the US, which was on the tame side in terms of performance, and that might not be a bad thing.

Compared to the startlingly over-powered Vistiq, the Optiq actually felt like the sort of car you might be interested in if you felt like you should buy an EV, and you wanted a luxury one, but you’re put off, or indeed frightened, by the crazed performance of most electric vehicles.

It’s hard to believe any dual motored EV could feel sane and normal, but in the cases of the Optiq we’re talking about a machine that takes around six seconds to get to 100km/h.

Throw in the fact that it makes familiar sounding, ICE-like noises from its fake-sound generator, and you could actually kid yourself that you’re driving a combustion car.

The Optiq is also comfortable, smooth and pleasant, with a nice ride-handling balance and an air of mid-table luxury – think Lexus rather than Audi, Benz or BMW.

It’s neither exciting, nor threatening, it’s just nice. Capable. Like the kind of Americans you meet in the nicer bits of the south, and less like the ones you meet in Texas.

2025 Cadillac Optiq: Verdict

If Cadillac is ever going to make an impression on Australian buyers, in a market packed with other options and a populace to whom the word “Cadillac” thus far means very little, the Optiq just might be the right-sized, right-priced option that does it.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, buyers of new, qualifying EVs could be eligible for up to $7,500 in federal income tax credits, and preowned EVs that qualify could receive up to $4,000.

The bank or the automaker’s finance company can take a $7,500 tax credit for EV leases but may discount your lease accordingly, according to Edmunds, a car shopping website.

The impending elimination of the tax credit hasn’t exactly sent droves of customers into area dealerships looking to buy an EV.

“We haven’t really seen anybody running in yet, which is surprising because we thought we would,” said Amanda Ryan, a sales consultant for Sylvester Chevrolet in Blakely. “When they first came out with the tax credit, we had a rush of people. I don’t know if it’s just that people aren’t in the market or if people who were going to rush for it already have them. I would say, if anything, maybe next month we’ll get a lot of people coming in for them, but it’s hard to speculate because of how inventory levels, interest rates and all other kinds of stuff play into it as well.”

Charles McFadden, general manager of Audi Wyoming Valley in Plains Twp., recently noticed a small bump in electric vehicle interest at the Luzerne County dealership.

“EV sales have never been all that strong in our area, but there is a slight uptick in anticipation and a lot of incentives from the manufacturer to help beat that deadline,” he said.

McFadden fears sales will plummet once the tax credit expires at the end of next month.

“I believe it will go to just about zero,” he said. “Our manufacturer is taking a very conservative view of the short-term future of EVs.”

McFadden believes several things need to happen for electric vehicle sales to pick up in Northeast Pennsylvania, starting with better incentives.

“Other states give very good rebates for EVs; our state doesn’t give any,” he said. “I just got back from a meeting in Seattle and the Audi dealer that has about 40% EV sales — that’s hugely different than around here.”

He also feels the region needs to add more charging stations to make people more willing to switch from a gas-powered to an electric vehicle.

“We don’t really have much infrastructure,” McFadden said. “If you’re on the West Coast, you can charge your car anywhere.”

McFadden also thinks once the range of travel for electric vehicles increases more customers will consider making a purchase.

“I drive an EV and they’re a really great car,” he said. “They’re quick and they don’t require anywhere near the maintenance of an internal combustion engine. But if the car is only going to go 300 miles on a charge, and you don’t have an easily accessible charge point, you’re not comfortable with it. When you can increase the range of the car and add infrastructure to have very available charge points, that car is going to do very well.”

Sales of electric vehicles have been up and down at Sylvester Chevrolet and more customers have been leasing than buying them, Ryan said.

“Our best seller has been the Equinox because of the affordability of it,” she said. “We definitely sell more internal combustion engines than we do EVs. Usually we average one or two EVs a month, but our area is not as popular with the EVs.”

The elimination of the tax credits likely won’t help matters, Ryan added.

“It’s just a matter of if the manufacturers are going to step up and offer more incentives to kind of make up for the tax incentive going away, but I do believe it’s going to affect sales a little bit,” she said.

Joseph Yoon, a consumer insights analyst for Edmunds, anticipates a drop in EV sales after the tax credit expires following some positive momentum in July.

“I think through the end of the year there will probably be a pretty noticeable decline,” he said. “The $7,500 off a new car is no joke, especially when it comes to leasing, where a lot of these sales are happening. We were talking about this internally (Monday) about what that kind of looks like when it comes to leasing; if you take $7,500 and divide it by 36 months, it’s $208.33 before taxes and before the interest rate is applied to the monthly payment. I think it’s definitely going to change the arithmetic for a lot of buyers who may have been searching for deals.

“The $7,500 off plus whatever dealer incentives and manufacturer incentives there were got me into an EV and I’m sure it was the case for hundreds of thousands of buyers.”

The ending of the tax credits earlier than expected will likely shift the decision-making for automakers, Yoon added.

“I think it’s going to change the way they prioritize how they bring EVs to the market now,” he said. “It’s unfortunate for buyers because, I think, it will mean projects will ultimately be delayed or the selections in the United States may be more limited than they could have been. I think the more agile automakers are going to do their best to adjust pricing and trim levels to keep their sales numbers going to the best of their ability. But I think in the short term there will definitely be declines in sales and market share as both consumers, dealers and the automakers try to navigate this time crunch. Hopefully automakers can make the pricing work. … They have a whole mountain of challenges ahead of them with the tariffs.”

In July, new EV sales rose to 130,082 units, up 26.4% month over month and 19.7% year over year, as the average transaction price dropped to $55,689 — down 2.2% from June and 4.2% from July 2024 — and the price gap with internal combustion engine vehicles narrowed to $7,611, the smallest since December, according to a Cox Automotive report.

It represented the second-highest monthly total on record, with 11 brands posting their best EV sales of the year and the top five automakers by volume — Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford and Honda — all seeing strong gains, per the Cox Automotive report.

“People have been really latching onto these vehicles,” Yoon said. “It’s just hard for us to say what exactly will happen after Sept. 30.”",https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/STT-L-EVS-0823-01.jpg?w=1024&h=684,N,,2025-08-24 01:59:49.255980

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry.
President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects.
""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said.
In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island.","The Trump administration has ordered companies to stop construction of a wind farm that's being built off the coast of Rhode Island.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

""This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,"" Burdock said. ""In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.""

Benjamin Franklin’s noted idiom about two things that are inevitable, may need tweaking.

Along with death and taxes, today increasing electric bills should be considered inevitable as well.

Electric consumers in New Hampshire are about to be hit with significant increases for the cost of the power and for distribution and transmission as the long neglected infrastructure is being upgraded with the costs spread to all ratepayers in New England.

New Hampshire and New England have a history of some of the highest electric rates in the country for a number of reasons including the lack of native fuels like oil or natural gas. As one former state consumer advocate used to explain it, New England is the tailpipe of the electric system and everyone has added a charge along the line.

After Public Service of NH — now Eversource — went bankrupt and emerged as part of the Northeast Utilities group, the seven 4.5 percent yearly rate increases to pay off the cost of taking over the utility put New Hampshire at the top of the nation for electric rates and brought on the deregulation of the electric portion of the industry.

The state has long been dependent on fossil fuels to generate electricity and with the last coal-fired plant in New England in Bow, to oil and more recently natural gas to go along with the Seabrook Nuclear Plant.

The current presidential administration wants to ensure its oligarchical friends and funders, many of whom became multi-billionaires through the fossil fuel industry, continue to feed at the trickle-up trough draining money from the other 99 percent.

This administration is ending tax credits for solar panels and other alternative fuel sources as well as electric vehicles, and last week ordered a nearly complete wind generating project off the coast of Rhode Island to stop construction.

Wind farms have proliferated in other areas of the country and have provided considerable power at what are now stable and competitive prices.

Coupled with battery storage systems they are a more reliable power supply than in the past.

In New Hampshire, we are all too aware of the hunger for hydro generated power from Quebec in Massachusetts and the unsuccessful Northern Pass Transmission project, but with the growing demand for electricity in that province, Hydro Quebec is not the source of readily available cheap and non-fossil fuel generated power it once was.

At the same time, the once plentiful supplies of natural gas that were relatively cheap are drying up as more and more of the gas is turned into liquified natural gas and sold on the world market, making the price much more volatile here at home.

New Hampshire and New England are most dependent on natural gas to generate power and that is one of the reasons the price is going up and up and up.

Another cost generator is the lack of an adequate supply of natural gas particularly in the cold winter months when many homes and buildings are heated by natural gas and they are the priority during extended cold spells. Power generators have to turn to liquified natural gas to power their plants at much higher prices as they compete with the rest of the world, mostly Europe, for the commodity.

The inadequate supply had Gov. Kelly Ayotte calling for revisiting a mothballed proposed natural gas pipeline running from the natural gas rich Marcellus Shale under Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia to the Boston area.

The proposal was backed by several states including New Hampshire when Maggie Hassan was governor, but met strong resistance wherever the route was proposed and ultimately fell apart when electric utilities failed to agree to purchase the gas under guaranteed long-term contracts.

Never mind that it would take many years to engineer, site and work through the regulatory agencies in several states for a new pipeline project, but the guaranteed purchase issue is not likely to change as long as the transmission line through Maine to bring Hydro Quebec power to Maine and Massachusetts is viable as is another transmission line along western New England that is already permitted to carry more Hydro Quebec power.

With the current administration’s hostility to all but fossil fuel generated electricity and its carbon emissions further fueling global warming, the price of electricity has only one way to go and that is up.

Several bills passed by the Republican controlled legislature during the 2025 session cemented that scenario in place with a revised state energy plan putting the thumb on the fossil fuel scale and eliminating the state’s wind development agency.

At the same time, the Free State/Libertarian cohort in the legislature successfully pushed bills to encourage the development of data centers in the state.

One bill signed into law, would allow small, self-contained nuclear generating units to be used off grid and free of regulation by the Public Utilities Commission to power the potential data centers.

Data centers host the ICloud and other mega clouds, and are essential crypto currency transactions and the exploding AI industry.

The centers are proliferating around the country and in many cases are grouped together in states like Georgia, Colorado, Texas, Arizona and Louisiana.

These data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and also water to cool the computers with some proposed centers requiring a million gallons of water a day.

The centers are often located in areas with cheap electricity but often with scarce water supplies causing surrounding homes and businesses to lose their water supply or to render it unusable.

Because the centers require a tremendous amount of electricity, the electric distribution systems have to be upgraded and in most cases the cost is spread to the utilities’ other customers.

The massive use of electricity has in some cases disrupted the area grid and are also security threats.

There are no data centers in New Hampshire today, but the Free State/Libertarians in the legislature would like New Hampshire to be the region’s go to place for data centers.

By allowing the centers to operate without regulation opens Pandora’s Box as yet one more group escapes the socialization of costs for the rest of the people and businesses in New Hampshire. The same group is pushing that scenario in other areas as well like education and health care.

At a time when electricity costs are skyrocketing and the current administration is cutting off alternative sources for generation, the state does not need a new questionable industry setting up shop and disrupting the system further and putting pressure on the water supply.

And the already exploding electric prices will shoot up like a Space X rocket.

Boosting Clean, Local Energy Production In addition to boosting the local economy, Community Solar also helps accelerate the production of local, renewable, and affordable clean energy.
National solar developer US Solar has partnered with New Mexico-based Sol Luna Solar to develop and build seven Community Solar Gardens throughout the state.","As the cost of living continues to rise, utility bills remain a major expense for many households and business owners. As a result, interest in solar energy is growing. But for many, the high upfront cost of installing solar panels at home or on their business is a barrier. Fortunately, there’s an alternative: Community Solar, a solution that’s gaining popularity across the country. New Mexico’s program is relatively new, with some projects just entering construction and energizing in the next year.

But what exactly is a Community Solar Garden (CSG)? In simple terms, a CSG is a large solar system located on a plot of land, allowing multiple subscribers — such as residents, renters, small businesses, or community organizations — to benefit from solar energy without having to install panels on their own property. By subscribing to a CSG, participants contribute to generating local, clean energy for their utility company. The electricity that is generated is then fed into the local power grid, and subscribers receive monthly credits on their utility bills based on their share of the energy that has been produced.

This model eliminates common barriers to going solar, allowing participants to lower their electricity bills while supporting local clean energy — a true win-win. And in a place like sunny New Mexico, the potential is huge. CSGs offer a wide range of benefits, so let's dig in.

Accessing the Benefits of Clean Energy: One of the primary advantages of Community Solar is accessibility. Factors like roof orientation, homeownership status and structural limitations can keep homeowners, renters, and small businesses alike from installing solar panels. Community Solar programs completely remove those barriers, making it possible for all to enjoy the benefits of solar energy, including renters, those who live in apartments, and households that simply can’t afford the upfront costs of a rooftop solar system. In fact, many state programs are designed to prioritize access for low-to-moderate income households.

Financial Savings and Lower Electric Costs: For many, financial savings are one of the most attractive benefits of participating in Community Solar. There are no upfront costs to join a CSG. Participants receive credits for the electricity their share of the garden generates and pay a smaller fee to the CSG operator, effectively lowering their electric bill. The result? Immediate and ongoing savings, without the cost, commitment, or maintenance that comes with owning solar panels. On average, US Solar expects households subscribed to our New Mexico projects to save approximately $16 per month on their utility bills.

Economic Advancement and Local Job Creation: Building Community Solar Gardens stimulates local economies. The construction and maintenance of these projects create both permanent and temporary local jobs in fields like engineering, installation, and landscaping. And because these projects are located within the same utility territory as their subscribers, the benefits stay local. In more rural areas, hosting a solar garden can provide a stable income for farmers and landowners who lease out their underused land for solar development. Supporting an initiative that boosts the local economy and benefits its residents is truly invaluable.

Boosting Clean, Local Energy Production In addition to boosting the local economy, Community Solar also helps accelerate the production of local, renewable, and affordable clean energy. Getting more clean energy on the grid close to where it’s being consumed is becoming increasingly important as energy demand and electricity costs continue to rise across our country. Community Solar is one way to help meet the increasing need for power.

National solar developer US Solar has partnered with New Mexico-based Sol Luna Solar to develop and build seven Community Solar Gardens throughout the state. That adds up to nearly 34 MWdc of clean, renewable energy — enough to power 8,000 homes. In addition to small businesses and municipalities, we expect to serve almost 4,000 income-qualified households, connecting them with meaningful savings on their utility bills.

Ultimately, Community Solar Gardens are more than just a way to generate clean electricity — they deliver financial, economic, and environmental benefits that all residents of New Mexico can enjoy. They represent a powerful shift toward a more equitable and sustainable energy future. In a state like sunny New Mexico, the benefits of CSGs could be life changing. They’re an opportunity everyone should consider.","https://www.lcsun-news.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/24/PTX1/85361776007-carne-solar-project-march-20251.JPG?crop=3891,2190,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-23 23:59:12.234149

With global competition for rare earth elements intensifying, Southeast Asia's untapped deposits are becoming more strategically valuable.","From nickel processing plants in Indonesia to rare earth mines in Myanmar, Chinese companies are expanding operations in sectors that environmentalists warn could have severe long-term consequences for rivers, air quality and local communities.

The shift is driven partly by stricter rules and excess industrial capacity in China, as well as by the lure of cheaper labor, weaker environmental enforcement and resource-rich landscapes in neighboring countries.

While Beijing has become Southeast Asia's biggest financier of clean energy, analysts say its green investments are often overshadowed by its involvement in some of the region's most polluting industries.

The result is a complicated picture: Chinese capital is helping to build solar farms and hydropower dams, but also fueling environmental disputes, health risks and rising political tensions.

It's also putting the spotlight on whether Southeast Asian governments are as committed to protecting the environment as they say.

""The reality is that most governments care more about economic development than they do environmental sustainability; exactly as the Chinese government did,"" Zachary Abuza, professor at the National War College in Washington, D.C., told DW.

Rising pushback in Indonesia

Since late last year, there have been protests and strikes at several Chinese-run nickel processing plants in Indonesia.

In July, Jakarta announced it would sanction companies for environmental violations at the sprawling Morowali Industrial Park nickel hub, run by the Chinese metals giant Tsingshan Holding Group, on the island of Sulawesi.

In February, the US government-funded security nonprofit C4ADS found that more than three-quarters of Indonesia's nickel refining capacity is controlled by Chinese companies, many with ties to the government in Beijing.

Two firms alone, including Tsingshan, account for more than 70% of Indonesia's refining capacity.

""A lack of domestic control leaves Indonesia reliant upon Chinese investment… which may limit the government's ability to hold the industry accountable,"" the report said.

Are Chinese firms polluting the Mekong River?

Pushback has also grown over allegations that Chinese firms are polluting vast stretches of the Mekong River through expanded rare earth extraction in war-torn Myanmar.

Communities in Laos and Thailand have complained in recent months about spikes in arsenic and other toxic metals.

In June, Thailand's pollution agency tested water in northern Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai — across the border from Myanmar's Shan State, a mining hot spot — and found arsenic levels nearly five times higher than international drinking water standards.

A report by the Institute for Strategy and Policy in Myanmar found that the number of rare earth mines in one state has nearly tripled to about 370 since the military coup in 2021.

Thai officials and parliamentarians have pressed Beijing to curb the environmental impact of these operations, prompting China's embassy in Bangkok to insist that all Chinese firms ""comply with the laws of the host country and… conduct their business in a legal and orderly fashion at all times.""

Pianporn Deetes, campaigns director at NGO International Rivers, warned that the risk is ""expected to become even more concentrated and persistent"" with the planned, Chinese-funded Pak Beng hydropower dam in Laos, which ""could trap and accumulate polluted sediments in its reservoir.""

China's green push

There's mounting criticism, but: China is also Southeast Asia's largest investor in renewable energy.

The international research organization Zero Carbon Analytics reported in June that China poured more than $2.7 billion (€2.3 billion) into clean energy projects in the region over the last decade, largely through the state-led Belt and Road Initiative.

However, Chinese companies are simultaneously expanding into pollution-heavy sectors.

An article in Nikkei Asia by Soon Cheong Poon and Guanie Lim of Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies noted that ""pollution-heavy industries are leaving China… and settling in smaller Southeast Asian countries.""

These include the waste-paper and iron and steel industries.

""Facing stricter environmental regulations and excess capacity at home, Chinese steelmakers have turned to Southeast Asia since 2017,"" the article said.

Lim told DW that avoiding US tariffs is another motivation for relocation.

""These plants, because of their scale, tend to create employment and linkages to the broader industrial ecosystem. However, many of these jobs are low-paying and pose health hazards,"" she said.

Fengshi Wu, associate professor in political science and international relations at the University of New South Wales in Australia, noted that several Southeast Asian states, especially Indonesia, have adopted ""resource nationalism,"" introducing export bans to ensure minerals are processed domestically.

This allows them to gain value-added profits from resource extraction, rather than simply exporting the raw materials for foreign companies to make the bulk of the revenue.

""Indonesia would like to see more minerals processed inside the country. So comes the pollution, unless more effective environmental pollution measures are taken,"" Wu said.

The bigger picture

Ultimately, analysts say the issue comes down to supply and demand.

""China has some of the world's most experienced, capable companies in some of the most polluting, high-environmental-impact sectors,"" Juliet Lu, assistant professor in the School for Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, Canada, told DW.

These sectors are increasingly shunned by development finance institutions but remain attractive to Southeast Asian governments eager for rapid economic growth.

With global competition for rare earth elements intensifying, Southeast Asia's untapped deposits are becoming more strategically valuable.

""The question that is not asked frequently enough is whether and how non-Chinese companies operating in the same sectors and country contexts do things differently,"" Lu said.

""If Chinese company violations are more egregious than others, where are the positive levers to push both in China and in the host country?""

At the end of the day, she added, China's funds, technical expertise and services are in high demand, and ""countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, who want roads built, energy infrastructure established or mines opened have multiple reasons they turn to China.""

Used EVs are ‘outperforming’ other fuel types at auction

While almost all cars depreciate the second they leave the lot, studies have found that EVs are particularly hard hit.

One recent study found that gas cars declined at around 3.1 percent in price, whereas the figure for EVs was an astonishing 31.8 percent.

And a Tesla owner found this out for himself when he took his Model Y to WeBuyAnyCar only to be offered around half of the $70,000 he paid for it.

In the US July was almost the best-selling month ever for EVs, while over in the UK, used EVs are currently experiencing a strong performance at auction.

UK-based BCA recently released figures confirming that EV cars currently had the highest first-time conversion of any fuel type, meaning they were the most likely type of vehicle to sell on their first listing.

They also had the strongest CAP performance of any fuel type.

“BCA’s inventory levels remain healthy for the summer months – we continue to sell more than 1,000 used EVs every week, so supply issues are not driving the daily strong price performance we are seeing in this sector,” COO at BCA, Stuart Pearson, said.

“Many motor trade buyers have realized both the incredible value and the profit opportunity that many EVs represent, given the growing acceptance from consumers for electric vehicles.”

How to get more cash for your used EV

Pearson went on to share some handy tips on getting more money when selling your used EV.

“There are new levels of sophistication that every seller should be using to ensure that EVs reach their optimum price in the market,” he said in a statement.

“This includes investing in the right level of pre-sale preparation, describing them properly with in-depth information covering not just the cosmetic and mechanical condition, but also the health of the battery, and aligning all of this with real-time pricing intelligence to support accurate decision making.”",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/ev_sales.webp,N,,2025-08-24 02:00:03.484981

The marks follow through on Trump’s commitment to target wind and solar projects if he won reelection as he campaigned for a second term last year.

“They destroy everything, they’re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,” Trump said of wind farms during a rally in May 2024. “They ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.”

Revolution Wind was authorized by the Biden administration two years ago. The $1.5 billion project promised to provide electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

However, the wind industry has weathered a number of storms in the Trump era due to concerns from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and others that the projects are highly “inefficient” and “unreliable” uses of federal lands compared to energy sources with smaller footprints, such as nuclear, gas, and oil.

Federal subsidization of such projects has been targeted, including through Trump’s recently signed into law “big, beautiful” bill, while government reviews authorizing them have become more stringent, lengthening the already bureaucratic permitting process. Burgum said in late July that such actions were warranted due to the belief that Biden-era officials had given green energy developments “special treatment.”

Burgum has canceled several high-profile wind energy projects previously authorized under the Biden administration, aside from the Rhode Island development, including a massive Idaho wind farm earlier this month.

“We are protecting tens of thousands of acres from harmful wind policy while shielding the interests of rural Idaho communities,” he said at the time.

Approval for a wind energy project off the coast of Long Island was also rescinded in April, although Burgum later reversed course, allowing construction on the renewable energy farm to continue.

Instead of pursuing energy development branded as climate-friendly under the Biden administration, Burgum has pursued oil and gas projects, which were restricted during the Biden era in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While wind projects are still an option for regions where the elements are conducive to the policy, “not every state is lucky to have the resources” that lend themselves to wind farms, Burgum has argued, saying the U.S. has “to have the right balance.”

The renewables obligation has grown from nothing to cost every UK home more than £100 a year – and it’s set to keep growing even though it was abolished eight years ago.

The green energy subsidy was closed to new entrants in 2017, but is still poised to add £38bn to UK power bills over the next five years, documents from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have revealed.

A decision by the Labour politicians who created it 25 years ago means costs are still rising – and it will add an average £108 to every household power bill this year.

The renewables obligation was a scheme set up by Tony Blair’s government to encourage developers to build more green energy generation capacity, such as wind and solar farms, and to push suppliers to buy more clean power.

But a decision to link the cost of the scheme to an outdated measure of inflation has led to spiralling costs, meaning the renewables obligation is now by far the biggest of the six main green levies added to Britain’s power bills.

It has added over £75bn to the nation’s energy bills between its introduction in 2002 and now – and it will continue rising.

The “zombie” levy cost £6.7bn in 2023-24, according to the OBR, but this is forecast to jump to £8.5bn by 2026, a 25pc increase.

It implies annual household energy bills could increase by at least another £20 over the next two to three years simply because of the subsidy.

John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity focused on energy data transparency, said successive governments had lost control of the system, with consumers paying the price.

“Even though it was killed off for new entrants in 2017, the renewables obligation system is still costing consumers more each year.

“A combination of bad initial design and foolish revisions favouring the wind and solar industries has turned the system into a zombie levy, devouring householder cash and sucking the blood from our businesses. Any future government that wishes to restore the UK to economic health will have to use primary legislation to finally kill it off.”

‘Stealth tax on households’

The origins of the “zombie” levy go back to 2000 and Blair’s first government. Stephen Byers, the then-business and energy secretary, piloted the Utility Act 2000 through Parliament, which enabled the renewables obligation system.

Under the scheme, electricity generators could claim a renewable obligation certificate, or ROC, for each megawatt hour produced from renewables such as wind, solar or hydropower.

Separately, suppliers – the companies that bring power into our homes and businesses – had to hand over a specified number of ROCs to Ofgem, the regulator, each year.

The system immediately created a market for these green energy certificates, with suppliers effectively forced to buy them from renewable generators.

Since the cost of a ROC was close to the cost of a megawatt hour, the scheme typically doubled green energy generators’ income.

Since trading was between businesses, the system wasn’t clearly flagged on energy bills. But consumers were ultimately paying for them through higher power prices as suppliers passed on the cost.

The scheme was implemented in 2002 under Byers’ successor, Patrica Hewitt, also Labour, creating what some have called the ultimate Whitehall stitch-up of consumers.

The real damage lay in a single decision: to link the cost of these green certificates to the retail price index (RPI).

Ministers wanted to link ROCs to inflation to ensure they kept their real-terms value. However, economists view RPI as a discredited measure that massively overstates the inflation rate.

The Office for National Statistics agrees and relies on a different measure, the consumer price index (CPI).

The difference between the two is stark. Since January 2002, prices have risen by 88.5pc according to the CPI, but on the RPI, they are up 133.4pc.

The linkage of ROCs to RPI has created a massive and continuing windfall for the 26,000 or so renewables generators that registered for the system.

For consumers, it has meant ever bigger bills to fund that windfall.

A second separate decision has amplified the impact. The ROC scheme was meant to encourage development of new renewable generation capacity. But that risked leaving schemes built before 2002 out in the cold. Those built after that date could juice their profits by selling ROCs, leaving legacy generators struggling to keep up.

So they were allowed to join too. About 600 such generators did just that, with the oldest being a hydropower plant built at Kinlochleven, in Scotland, in 1909.

Drax, Britain’s largest coal-fired power station, was also allowed to claim ROCs after converting its boilers to run on wood shipped from the US.

It argues such power is renewable, enabling it to claim green certificates worth £617m in 2022 and £587m in 2023. Overall it has been paid £6.2bn under the renewables obligation system, making it among the scheme’s biggest beneficiaries.

Ed Miliband reviewed the system during his first stint as energy secretary in 2009, awarding offshore wind developers and others extra certificates for each megawatt hour generated to incentivise developers.

That change just increased the costs. By 2015, ROCs were adding £40 to the annual domestic bill and becoming a costly political embarrassment.

Greg Clark, the then-energy secretary, closed the scheme to new entries in 2017 and replaced it with the contracts for difference system, a different subsidy scheme also inflation-linked – but to the CPI.

For projects already in the ROC system, however, the bonanza will continue until 2037 – as will the costs to consumers. The impact on household bills rose to £79 in 2020 and £108 this year, about 11pc of the average power bill.

By 2028 it could be more than £130.

Sam Dumitriu, of Britain Remade, a campaign group, says that ROCs did some good in getting renewables off the ground in the early days.

But he adds: “It isn’t right that struggling households pay the cost of legacy subsidies like ROCs. At a time when we are trying to persuade people to buy EVs and install heat pumps, it is counterproductive to make electricity more expensive.

“They are, in essence, a regressive stealth tax on households. It would be fairer to shift costs like this on to general taxation.”

‘Expensive disaster’

Green energy certificates are driving up prices for business and industry too.

Patrick Matthewson, of Make UK, a trade body for manufacturers, says: “The renewable obligation is the biggest policy cost that UK manufacturers face. These costs act as a drag on industrial competitiveness.

“Removing the renewable obligation from manufacturers’ electricity bills would provide immediate and significant cost relief without compromising any ongoing policy objective.”

In Ofgem’s latest annual report on the ROC scheme, Neil Lawrence, the regulator’s “director of schemes”, mounts a staunch defence of the system.

He said it “made an impressive contribution to the Government’s ambitions for green energy” by “providing millions of UK households and businesses with a secure supply of clean electricity”.

“Renewable electricity accounted for a record 46.4pc of the electricity generated in the UK in 2023, and the RO’s role in this has been pivotal,” he wrote.

Yet the sheer size of the scheme, and its costs to consumers and businesses, means it is becoming increasingly political.

Richard Tice, Reform Party energy spokesman, said: “These ROCs have been an expensive disaster for British households who have been lumbered with ever higher electricity bills.

“Reform will scrap stupid net zero that has caused all these extra costs and destroyed many tens of thousands of jobs.”

Claire Coutinho, energy secretary in the last Conservative government and now shadow energy spokeswoman, said consumers were paying a huge price for Miliband’s flawed revision of the ROC system.

“The renewable obligation was Ed Miliband’s baby … Every family in Britain is still facing higher energy bills thanks to the extortionate contracts he signed back in 2009,” she said.

“The Energy Secretary needs to get a grip, avoid the mistakes he made in 2009, and start putting cheap energy first.”

A spokesman for Miliband’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “The renewables obligation scheme laid the foundation for today’s thriving clean energy sector – driving down the costs of wind and solar power.

“Through these levies, we are delivering value for money for taxpayers, while driving investment in renewables and other generation technologies.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/08/22/TELEMMGLPICT000432995190_17558781656830_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwarI9ukQAzz8J0u7PEbMdV0.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-24 00:59:33.556868

They are guaranteed returns for their investors in the range of 10% by the decisions of the corporation commission.","In the last 485 million years, there has only been one period when Earth’s temperature rose nearly as fast as it is rising now.

That happened about 250 million years ago. It produced the End-Permian Extinction, also known as the “Great Dying,” when about 90 percent of the species on Earth died off.

The temperature rose so fast, due apparently to volcanic eruptions and the release of carbon dioxide, that the evolution of most of Earth’s life couldn’t keep up with the speed of Earth’s heating.

“The rate of warming right now is faster than anything we know about, even faster than 250 million years ago,” said Prof. Jessica Tierney, a University of Arizona paleoclimatologist who helped lead the study that charted Earth’s temperature over all those millennia.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the “master dial” of Earth’s temperature, Tierney said: When carbon dioxide is up, Earth’s temperature goes up, and when carbon dioxide is down, Earth’s temperature goes down.

Arizona’s utility regulators have one finger among many on that master dial. The five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission can decide if we in Arizona are going to contribute more or less to the surge of carbon dioxide going into Earth’s atmosphere, now putting us on a pace for another possible mass extinction.

But nobody seemed too conscious of the Great Dying when they discussed a renewable-energy mandate at the Aug. 14 Arizona Corporation Commission meeting. This 20-year-old rule required Arizona’s regulated utilities to generate at least 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources by this year, 2025, a small percentage in retrospect.

They could have considered a new, higher mandate, but in 2023, the commission rejected the idea of requiring regulated utilities to get all their energy from renewables by 2050, or even by 2070. They turned against the idea of such mandates altogether.

The politics of the moment

On Aug. 14, three concepts dominated the commission members’ conversation: Affordability, reliability and free markets. Not the threat of climate disaster. In ignoring the climate implications of their decision to start eliminating clean-energy mandates, they reflected the nihilistic politics of the moment.

All five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission belong to Pres. Donald Trump’s party, the GOP. And Trump has set the tone when it comes to renewable energy — it is “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY,“ in his distorted view, expressed online Wednesday.

What he wants is a return to carbon-dioxide emitting fossil fuels, an industry that — coincidentally, I’m sure — donated generously to his campaign. They quickly reaped the reward. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that attempted to destroy federal efforts at climate-change mitigation, while opening federal lands to greater energy exploitation.

On April 8, Trump issued an executive order on “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” that encouraged further exploitation of coal on federal lands and use of it to power data centers, despite the fact that there is no such thing as clean coal.

On July 4, came the real triumph for the carbon-dioxide spewers: The Big Beautiful Bill contains billions in giveaways to the fossil-fuel industry, including reducing the royalties the industry must pay for mining and exploitation on federal lands.

The bill also is ending tax incentives for renewable energy development, included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that were spurring blue-collar jobs and clean-energy growth around the United States.

The pathological hatred of renewable energy goes so deep that the Trump administration, on Friday, ordered a halt to construction of a wind-energy project that was largely complete off of Rhode Island’s shore. When complete, it would produce enough energy to power about 350,000 homes.

The federal energy policy is, in short, a nihilistic climate disaster, spurring the carbon-dioxide companies to pollute more, faster. And Arizona’s Corporation Commission is stepping in line.

Arizona utilities are regulated

Commissioners such as Tucson’s Lea Marquez Peterson put their decision in the language of the free market.

“I hear from lobbyists frequently that today solar is one of the cheapest sources of energy,” Marquez-Peterson said at the Aug. 14 meeting. “That’s exactly why I support the elimination of a subsidy today. Based upon market demands and the low cost of solar, I believe that renewable energy will continue to thrive in Arizona.”

But the fact is, Arizona’s utilities do not operate in a free market. Here, the regulated utilities, like Tucson Electric Power and Arizona Public Service, are monopolies in their service areas. They are guaranteed returns for their investors in the range of 10% by the decisions of the corporation commission.

They make back the cost of every plant they build, plus profit. It is a system that incentivizes building expensive infrastructure such as power plants.

It’s very different here than in Texas, which has its own grid and a real competitive system for buying power. As a result, wind and solar power have boomed there.

In 2022 alone, a year of high natural-gas prices due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, renewables reduced Texas wholesale energy costs by $11 billion, concluded Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas who is writing a new report on more recent impacts. The savings then were about $200 per household over five years.

In a monopoly market like ours, he said Friday, mandates may be necessary to expand renewables because utilities have existing infrastructure they want to pay off.

“Say they buy an asset that turns out not to be competitive or the most efficient,” Rhodes said. “They’re probably going to utilize that asset for its expected lifetime even though there are more efficient ways of doing things, because there are sunk costs.”

Mandates make progress

Without a competitive market in Arizona, we can’t be guaranteed that the cheapest energy source will be used. So, mandates and pledges to use more renewables have been important to the progress we’ve made.

Even Marquez Peterson indirectly acknowledged the importance of such pledges in bringing renewables to market when she noted that many Big Tech companies are looking to place facilities in Arizona.

“Most of them, like Microsoft, Google and Amazon, have their own ambitious clean energy goals and are requesting clean energy generation sources, which influence the energy portfolio of the future for our regulated utilities,” she said.

Our utilities, too, have had such goals. Tucson Electric Power has committed to retiring its coal-burning plants by 2032 and to get more than 70% of its power from solar and wind by 2035.

Arizona Public Service, the state’s largest utility, also had a commitment of its own: To get 100% of its power from zero-carbon sources by 2050, and 65% from renewable sources by 2030. On Aug. 6, the company’s CEO said the company is abandoning that pledge in favor of a vaguer commitment to be “carbon-neutral” by 2050.

While TEP’s staying on course is commendable, none of these pledges is, of course, enforceable. Mandates are. And as a body regulating monopoly utilities, the corporation commission should not pretend it is overseeing a free market. It should regulate them, considering long-term threats along with short-term costs and benefits.

After all, they have a finger on the master dial and can turn down Arizona’s carbon-dioxide emissions, helping a bit to slow the dangerous heating of the planet.

Containerized Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Market Scope:

The advanced lead-acid battery type is estimated to account for a significant market share in the containerized BESS market during the forecast period

Advanced lead-acid batteries are expected to secure a significant share of the containerized BESS market, particularly in cost-sensitive and short-duration applications. While lithium-ion batteries dominate due to their high energy density and longer cycle life, advanced lead-acid technologies, such as absorbed glass mat (AGM) and gel batteries, offer compelling advantages in terms of lower upfront cost, proven safety, and ease of recycling. These attributes make them especially attractive for applications where budget constraints, thermal stability, and robust cycling under moderate loads are prioritized. In containerized BESS deployments, advanced lead-acid batteries are often utilized in microgrids, telecom infrastructure, rural electrification, and backup power systems across both developing and developed markets. Their mature supply chain, compatibility with standard power electronics, and reduced cooling requirements further enhance their value proposition in regions with limited technical support or extreme climate conditions. Their durability, safety, and recyclability position them as a key complement to lithium-ion systems, ensuring they continue to hold a notable share in the evolving containerized BESS landscape.

The 1,000–5,000 kWh segment is set to capture the largest market share in the forecast period

The 1,000–5,000 kWh capacity segment is estimated to capture the largest market share in the containerized BESS market, driven by its optimal balance between energy capacity, cost-efficiency, and operational flexibility. This range is ideally suited for a wide variety of applications across the commercial, industrial, and utility sectors, including peak shaving, load shifting, backup power, and renewable energy integration. Containerized BESS units in this capacity range are often deployed in 20-foot and 40-foot containers, offering modularity, scalability, and ease of transportation. Their size makes them well-suited for mid-scale projects such as EV charging hubs, microgrids, manufacturing facilities, and municipal substations, where higher capacity is required but space and budget constraints still apply.

Additionally, the growing adoption of solar-plus-storage systems in commercial and industrial applications is accelerating demand for this segment, as it allows for effective energy management and cost savings without overinvestment. With the increasing focus on decentralization, energy resilience, and grid flexibility, the 1000–5000 kWh segment is emerging as the most versatile and commercially attractive capacity range in the containerized BESS market.

By Lauren Teichner | Aug. 23, 2025

Red alert. The Trump Administration is now going after the very cornerstone of U.S. climate action: the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 Endangerment Finding. This landmark legal and scientific determination is what gives the EPA its authority to regulate climate pollution under the Clean Air Act.

On Aug. 1, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin filed a proposed rule that would “repeal all . . . emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines,” which includes cars, power plants, and other major sources of carbon emissions. This proposed rule is one of the most consequential Trump moves you may never have heard about. It is a brazen attempt to erase science, dismantle climate protections, and rewrite the law to benefit polluters.

The legal basis for limiting this dangerous pollution is unequivocal. In the landmark 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act and that the EPA has a legal obligation to regulate them if it determines they endanger public health or welfare. That’s exactly what the EPA did in 2009, issuing the Endangerment Finding after an exhaustive review of peer-reviewed science and more than 380,000 public comments.

Since then, every major legal challenge to the Endangerment Finding has failed. Never before has an administration attempted to overturn it. Zeldin’s effort to do so now isn’t just unprecedented, it’s a direct attack on the rule of law, science-based policymaking, the public’s right to clean air, and efforts to protect our planet for future generations. It’s like pretending cigarettes don’t cause cancer or that seatbelts don’t save lives.

The science underpinning the 2009 Endangerment Finding is not up for debate either. The science is even clearer today, 16 years—and countless climate disasters—later. Climate pollution is driving more extreme heat, catastrophic floods (like the recent horrific flooding in Texas), intense wildfires, and dangerous air quality.

These are lived realities, right here in Michigan and across the country. Children are missing summer camp and having asthma attacks because of smoke-filled air. Seniors are dying during heat waves. Farmers are struggling with unpredictable growing seasons and water shortages, leading to rising food prices.

The EPA’s job is to follow science, not twist it for political ends. And yet, in a disturbing contradiction, the agency is now claiming—on its own Instagram page, no less—that it is “fulfilling its mission to protect human health and the environment” even as it attempts to dismantle the very basis for regulating climate pollution.

Under the banner of its newly coined slogan, “Powering the Great American Comeback,” the EPA is abandoning its core duty in favor of polluter-friendly spin. The “environment” itself isn’t mentioned in that new slogan for a reason; ironically, protecting the environment is no longer part of the EPA’s agenda.

Let’s talk about what’s really going on here. Reversing the Endangerment Finding isn’t some technical policy tweak that you can ignore. It is a deliberate, full-scale assault on the very tools we rely on to protect public health and clean up our air.

If Zeldin succeeds in dismantling this cornerstone, the EPA will lose its legal authority to limit pollution from cars, trucks, power plants, oil refineries, and industrial facilities—the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The consequences would be immediate and far-reaching. More air pollution, more heat-related deaths, more respiratory illness, and more climate-driven disasters. Zeldin’s proposal serves polluter interests at the expense of the public interest.

In Michigan, we know what happens when the government turns a blind eye to science. Flint unfortunately taught us that. And according to the Environmental Law & Policy Center’s report Climate Change in the Midwest: 2025 Update (which you can find online), Michigan is already experiencing more extreme heat days, heavier rainfall events, and an increase in heat-related deaths and illnesses, as well as respiratory diseases. The report makes clear that climate change is not a distant threat—it’s a public health emergency already right here in Michigan.

The EPA should be protecting public health and the natural environment, not rewriting reality to suit polluters and their allies in Congress and the White House. This effort to erase the Endangerment Finding is a betrayal of the agency’s mission, the law, and the people it was created to serve.

Thankfully, we still have a chance to speak up. The EPA is accepting public comments on its proposal to reverse the 2009 Endangerment Finding through September 15, 2025. You can make your voice heard by submitting a comment (be sure to include Docket ID # EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194) at regulations.gov.

Tell the EPA that climate pollution is dangerous, that the science supporting the 2009 Endangerment Finding is stronger than ever, and that the agency must fulfill its legal and moral duty to protect our health, our air, and our children’s futures. Don’t let Administrator Zeldin kill and bury the important truths of the 2009 Endangerment Finding under a mountain of bureaucracy and spin.

Early adopters of electric vehicles in India are facing unexpected hurdles, including lengthy repair delays and insurance claim rejections. Unlike the established infrastructure for traditional vehicles, EV service networks are limited, leading to extended waiting periods. A significant issue is the lack of awareness regarding battery coverage, often an optional add-on.

When Ramesh Sharma bought his first electric vehicle (EV) last year, he believed he was making an environmentally conscious move that would also save him money in the long run. What he didn’t expect was to be stuck in a months-long nightmare just to get his car repaired after a minor battery issue.

His experience is becoming increasingly common among India's early EV adopters. As the country races toward its electric mobility goals, a growing number of e-car owners are reporting delays when they need to get the vehicles repaired, confusion over the insurance cover they need and even rejection of their claims.

Unlike the well-established network supporting vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICEs), the EV ecosystem is still in its infancy. Manufacturers have been cautious in expanding service centres, resulting in a handful of centralised hubs that are often far from both dealerships and customers. This gap leads to long waiting periods for repairs and complicated insurance processes.

“Comparing EVs with ICE vehicles isn’t appropriate,"" said Gaurav Arora, head of reinsurance, underwriting & claims for property and casualty at ICICI Lombard, India’s largest EV insurer. “The EV battery is like the engine, only more complex. Repairs take longer and specialised workshops are still few and far between.”

In ICE vehicles, minor claim approvals usually happen within a matter of hours. But for EVs, the process can stretch from two weeks to three months, experts say. It’s a mix of poor customer awareness, limited repair capabilities and a cumbersome approval chain that involves original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), insurance companies and dealerships that causes this delay.

Live Events

""Batteries make up nearly 40% of an EV’s cost,” a dealer said, requesting anonymity. ""We don’t stock them. Once an insurer approves the claim, we place an order. But that approval can take ages.” Until recently, EV batteries were only replaced, not repaired. That meant even minor issues could result in full battery replacements. On top of that, battery disposal is governed by environmental laws, adding another layer of complexity.

Lack of awareness

Now, OEMs are beginning to repair batteries or stock ""child parts,"" or individual components, to reduce turnaround time.

“Some OEMs have already initiated battery repair practices, and we have been encouraging others to follow suit,” said Arora. “We also advised OEMs to look into specific battery-related issues caused due to flooding or water logging, to help minimise such claims and improve the overall customer experience.”

But even as infrastructure slowly improves, another problem remains — consumer confusion.

Most EV buyers opt only for the primary insurance policy, unaware that the crucial battery cover is an optional add-on. When claims are denied, many are shocked to find out their policies didn’t include coverage for battery faults or water damage. ""Some customers buy insurance online just because it’s cheaper, not realising it doesn’t cover what they need,"" said a dealer. This has made EV insurance a costly proposition. Transporting damaged e-cars to far-off service centres drives up costs significantly. In some cases, the cost of transportation alone exceeds the value of the claim, prompting insurers to reject it altogether. Insurers and manufacturers acknowledge the issues, but say they’re temporary. Most leading OEMs, off the record, admitted the pain points. They’re betting on a dramatic ramp-up in service infrastructure over the next eight to 12 months, including opening more localised service hubs and conducting technician training programmes. ""We are continuously working to expand and enhance our service network and will soon introduce mobile service vans for EV servicing, bringing expert care directly to our customers’ doorstep,"" said Tarun Garg, chief operating officer at Hyundai Motors India, which has more than 400 dedicated EV service workshops covering nearly every city. “Our battery protection insurance plan safeguards one of the most valuable EV components, the battery along with charging cables,” he said.

“Collaboration is key,” said Arora. “We’re actively working with OEMs and dealers, feeding back customer pain points to improve response time and reduce claim costs.”

In the meantime, insurers are also urging EV owners to be proactive. Staying compliant with insurance regulations is crucial.

According to the rules of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, EVs must have third-party insurance. Skipping this can attract penalties besides claim rejections. While the rule on third-party insurance applies to all motor vehicles, some EV owners used to skip it believing that EVs don't need it. Frequent repricing of EV policies, driven by uncertainty around repair costs, has only added to customer anxiety.

Despite the challenges, experts remain optimistic.

As India’s EV ecosystem matures, smoother coordination between automakers and insurers will be vital. The hope is that early adopters won’t be penalised for their choice to go green.

Power Division Secretary Farzana Mamtaz put it bluntly: ""Power plants like Rupsha, Jera and others were not built in a planned manner without ensuring gas supply.""
""Those power plants are actually a pain for us,"" she told The Business Standard.
The 171MW Baghabari plant ran at just 2% plant factor, costing Tk43.36, while the 163MW Chandpur CC plant ran at 5% plant factor, costing Tk 20.04.
What's next When asked if Petrobangla plans to increase gas supply to power plants, AKM Mizanur Rahman, director (finance), said, ""We will not increase gas supply to power plants.","Policy backfires. These two words perfectly sum up Bangladesh's gas-based power strategy.

For two decades, the country has grappled with a widening gas shortage, even after importing LNG. Yet, the previous government kept approving gas-fired power plants without securing fuel.

The result is costly capacity payments for idle plants while the state misses out on cheaper electricity.

The latest victim is Jera's 718MW plant in Meghnaghat. It began commercial operation on 28 July but had to shut down in less than two weeks because Petrobangla could not supply the 130mmcfd of gas needed to run it.

And more trouble is brewing.

Four more large gas-fired plants, totalling 1,955MW, are expected online within 18 months. Together, they will demand an extra 615mmcfd, a figure power division officials admit is nearly impossible to manage given the current supply crunch.

Power Division Secretary Farzana Mamtaz put it bluntly: ""Power plants like Rupsha, Jera and others were not built in a planned manner without ensuring gas supply.""

""Those power plants are actually a pain for us,"" she told The Business Standard.

The problem is not only scarcity but also logistics.

Energy Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan explained Jera's rapid shutdown: ""Several gas-fired plants operate in Meghnaghat. We face both a gas shortage and distribution-line constraints. Jera had no option but to shut down.""

Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) Chairman Md Rezaul Karim said they will compare the costs of upcoming plants with existing coal and liquid-fuel plants.

""We are considering how to supply gas to plants, but it will take time,"" he also said.

Natural gas remains Bangladesh's most cost-effective power source – Tk6–8 per unit, versus Tk12–15 for coal and Tk25–27 for liquid fuel.

Yet the irony is stark: the cheapest source is also the most unreliable.

Conditional nod for Jera

The government allowed Jera to declare its Commercial Operation Date (COD) on condition that it agreed to a substantial tariff reduction. However, Jera refused, arguing that any readjustment required approval from its financiers.

Energy Adviser Fouzul Kabir Khan said, ""We gave COD to JERA on the condition of lowering the tariff significantly. Otherwise, it would only receive enough gas to keep the plant technically running. That is why the plant was damaged.""

He also confirmed that no capacity payment would be made, as the agreement contained multiple conditions that had not been fulfilled.

Under the 2019 power purchase agreement, BPDB committed to buying electricity from the 718MW plant for 22 years at a levelised tariff of Tk5.85 per kilowatt-hour. However, currency depreciation could increase that figure by around 25%.

Regarding why the Jera plant was allowed to start operations despite the fuel not being secured, Secretary Farzana Mamtaz told TBS that under the power purchase agreement, the plant owner can issue the COD themselves after meeting certain conditions, even if the government has not issued it.

To inquire about the plant's shutdown amid the gas crisis and the Power Division's push for tariff renegotiation, TBS emailed Pei Yong, senior manager of Public Relations at Jera Asia, on Thursday but received no response.

Jera acquired the Meghnaghat power plant from India's Reliance Power in 2019. Following the acquisition, the project company was renamed Jera Meghnaghat Power Limited (JMPL) on 9 October 2024.

Status of plants in pipeline

BPDB data shows more projects are on the horizon. Ghorashal's repowering Unit-4, with 409MW capacity, is due by December 2025 and will require 275mmcfd of gas. Unit-3, a 156MW project, is scheduled for June 2026 and will need 100mmcfd. Both are nearly complete.

North-West Power Generation Company's 800MW Rupsha LNG-fired plant is scheduled for January 2027. The contract was signed in 2019, and construction has progressed around 75% so far.

Another LNG-fired plant, a 590MW combined-cycle project in Anwara, Chattogram, is owned by United-Chattogram Power. Scheduled for commercial operation in January 2027, the contract was signed on 28 October 2021, and construction is 66% complete.

Regarding the Rupsha plant, Adviser Fouzul Kabir said, ""We have decided to issue the COD so the plant receives gas solely for internal consumption, keeping it technically operational. Otherwise, it risks becoming inoperable.""

State of existing plants

Bangladesh has 51 gas-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 11,504MW, demanding 2,420mmcfd of gas but receiving only 850–1,050mmcfd, and accounting for 43% of the total 26,955MW generation capacity.

Out of the 51 plants, only 32 remain operational.

There are 21 gas-fired power plants under Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company with a total gas requirement of 996mmcfd, yet average supply hovers at just 300–320mmcfd.

Of these, 13 plants with a combined capacity of 3,306MW remain completely shut due to gas shortages, and none are operating at full capacity.

Under Bakhrabad Gas Distribution Company Limited (BGDCL), 15 gas-fired plants with a total capacity of 2,755MW require 423.9mmcfd of gas but receive only 189.8mmcfd.

The situation is more severe for Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Limited (KGDCL), where supply is just 45.3mmcfd against a demand of 185mmcfd.

Power plants under Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited (JGTDSL) fare slightly better, receiving 269mmcfd against a demand of 395mmcfd. However, eight of its plants, totalling 652MW, have been offline for months.

At Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL), gas shortages have forced four plants, with a combined capacity of 222 MW, out of operation. Sundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL) faces a demand of 174mmcfd but receives only 98.9mmcfd.

Demand higher than what Petrobangla says

According to Petrobangla, the country's gas demand on Thursday stood at around 3,800mmcfd, though energy experts often dismiss this figure as unrealistic. On average, Petrobangla supplies 2,500–2,600mmcfd, occasionally reaching 2,800–2,900mmcfd.

Energy expert Ijaz Hossain told TBS at a recent policy dialogue, ""Petrobangla's claim on gas demand is absurd. Actual requirements exceed 4,500mmcfd. Unable to meet the expected demand, Petrobangla reports a suppressed figure.""

Energy Secretary Mohammad Saiful Islam concurred, noting that real gas demand in the country could reach as high as 5,000mmcfd.

Impact of gas crisis on plant factor

The ongoing gas crisis has forced gas-based power plants to operate at reduced plant factors, driving up production costs. In FY24, gas-based plants ran at an average 32% plant factor, with overall generation costing Tk6.30 per unit.

A plant factor is a measure of how much electricity a power plant actually produces compared to its maximum possible output over a period of time.

BPDB data shows that higher plant factors significantly lower production costs. The 383MW Bibiyana (South) plant, for example, ran at 72% plant factor in FY24, producing electricity at Tk3.68 per unit. Similarly, the 400MW Bibiyana-3 operated at 78% plant factor, with a cost of Tk3.49 per unit.

In contrast, underperforming plants faced soaring costs. The 171MW Baghabari plant ran at just 2% plant factor, costing Tk43.36, while the 163MW Chandpur CC plant ran at 5% plant factor, costing Tk 20.04. The 105MW Tongi plant, with zero plant factor, recorded an astronomical Tk1,345.31.

By comparison, in FY23, the average plant factor was 35%, and generation cost was Tk5.13 per unit, highlighting how higher utilisation drives down costs.

Power Division Secretary Farzana Mamtaz noted, ""To start commercial operation, plants must have sufficient gas supply and transmission infrastructure. We can't guarantee gas for all plants at this stage.""

What's next

When asked if Petrobangla plans to increase gas supply to power plants, AKM Mizanur Rahman, director (finance), said, ""We will not increase gas supply to power plants. Our priority is to supply more gas to industry and fertiliser production.""

He added, ""BPDB must ration the currently allocated gas. They need to prioritise energy-efficient plants over less efficient ones. Plants that consume more gas but produce less should be phased out.""

On why Petrobangla is not importing more gas to support power generation, Rahman explained, ""We face financing and regasification constraints. The FSRU can operate at an average of 85% capacity. For maintenance and natural contingencies, it can't run at 100% year-round.""",https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/08/23/gas-shortage-hits-power-plants-fea.png,N,,2025-08-23 21:01:42.005730

While the government touts flagship projects like the AESC gigafactory in Sunderland and Agratas' £4 billion Somerset facility, these developments remain dwarfed by the scale and speed of China's industrial juggernaut and the EU's uneven but coordinated efforts. For investors, the UK's fragmented policy approach and delayed gigafactory rollout pose a high-risk environment for domestic automakers, even as global competitors leverage strategic underinvestment to secure market dominance.

The UK's Lag: Delays and Policy Fragmentation

The UK's gigafactory strategy is marked by both progress and paralysis. The AESC plant in Sunderland, backed by £1 billion in public and private funding, is set to produce 15.8 GWh annually by 2025—enough for 100,000 EVs. Agratas' Somerset project, meanwhile, aims to produce 40 GWh by the early 2030s. Yet these milestones pale against China's 2025 capacity of over 1,000 GWh, driven by state-backed giants like CATL and BYD. The UK's reliance on ad hoc subsidies and delayed permitting processes has created a vacuum where global rivals thrive.

The Policy Commission on Gigafactories, chaired by Lord Hutton, highlights the UK's need for a unified roadmap. However, its recommendations—expected in 2026—arrive too late to counter China's efficiency-driven model. Chinese manufacturers, with waste rates under 10% (vs. 30%-40% globally), dominate the lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cell market, a cheaper and safer technology critical for mainstream EVs. The UK's focus on nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells, while technologically advanced, lacks the cost advantages of LFP, further straining competitiveness.

Global Rivals: China's Dominance and the EU's Uneven Recovery

China's gigafactory ecosystem is a masterclass in industrial policy. Government subsidies, fast-tracked approvals, and access to raw materials have enabled CATL and BYD to scale production rapidly. Their LFP cells, now powering over 70% of global EVs, undercut European NMC alternatives by 20%-30% in cost. Meanwhile, the EU, despite its own challenges, is adopting a more cohesive strategy. Hungary's low-cost energy and subsidies have attracted investments like Agratas' Somerset plant, while the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to secure supply chains.

The EU's struggles—high energy costs, permitting delays, and startup failures (e.g., Northvolt's scaled-back operations)—mirror the UK's issues. Yet the EU's recent €852 million in grants for battery projects and growing LFP capacity in Germany and Poland suggest a clearer path to self-sufficiency. The UK, by contrast, lacks comparable incentives, leaving its automakers exposed to volatile global supply chains.

Investment Implications: Capital Flows and Strategic Risks

For UK-based EV and battery firms, the risks are acute. Delays in gigafactory timelines and policy uncertainty could erode investor confidence, particularly as Chinese and EU rivals secure first-mover advantages. Agratas and AESC, despite their scale, face headwinds from supply chain bottlenecks and energy costs. Investors must weigh these risks against the UK's long-term net-zero goals and the potential for policy realignment.

Capital should prioritize firms aligning with policy trends. Agratas' Somerset project, for instance, benefits from government energy discounts and research funding, positioning it as a safer bet than unproven startups. Similarly, AESC's carbon-neutral energy model could attract ESG-focused investors. However, the UK's fragmented approach means even these projects require sustained public-private partnerships to succeed.

The Path Forward: Innovation and Resilience

To close the gap, the UK must shift from reactive to proactive investment. This includes:

1. Supply Chain Resilience: Diversifying raw material sources and investing in recycling infrastructure to reduce reliance on imports.

2. Policy Alignment: Streamlining permitting, offering direct subsidies for LFP cell production, and harmonizing trade agreements (e.g., the UK-US EV tariff reduction).

3. Strategic Partnerships: Leveraging the National Wealth Fund to co-invest in high-risk, high-reward projects, as seen in the AESC deal.

For investors, the UK's EV battery sector remains a high-stakes bet. While the government's long-term vision is ambitious, the absence of a cohesive strategy risks leaving domestic firms in the shadow of global giants. Those who bet on innovation, supply chain resilience, and policy-aligned projects may yet find opportunities in a market poised for transformation.

In a world where EVs define the next industrial revolution, the UK's ability to scale gigafactory capacity will determine not just its automotive future, but its place in the global energy economy. For now, the race is being won by those who invest with both vision and urgency.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 21:00:28.542851

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) cited unspecified “national security interests” and the need to “prevent interference with the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas” [2]. The decision has sparked widespread criticism from state and federal officials, environmental advocates, and industry leaders, who argue it undermines progress on clean energy and jeopardizes jobs.

Revolution Wind, a $4 billion project, had already installed 45 of its 65 turbines and was on track to become the first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in Rhode Island and Connecticut [1]. The project was expected to power more than 350,000 homes and reduce over one million metric tons of carbon emissions annually [2]. It was also aligned with the states’ ambitious climate goals, including Rhode Island’s 100% renewable target by 2033 and Connecticut’s zero-carbon electricity grid by 2040 [2]. The project had already secured 20-year power-purchase agreements with local utilities in 2019.

State officials have strongly condemned the decision. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee called the order arbitrary and politically motivated, warning it threatens hundreds of jobs and delays clean energy progress [2]. Senator Richard Blumenthal stated that the decision “defies all logic and reason,” noting the project had already employed hundreds of skilled tradespeople [2]. Senator Chris Murphy accused the administration of favoring the oil and gas industry and hinted at corruption, vowing to pursue legal options to restart the project [2].

Industry and environmental leaders have also criticized the move. The National Ocean Industries Association, which supports offshore wind, gas, and oil, noted that the U.S. currently has only one large-scale offshore wind project in operation and stressed the need for diverse energy sources [2]. The Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision “misguided,” stating it harms energy security and raises costs for American families [2]. Meanwhile, Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes offshore wind, supported the BOEM decision, claiming it protects the fragile ocean environment [2].

Ørsted has confirmed it is complying with the order and has taken steps to ensure worker safety and environmental protections [2]. The company had recently raised $9.4 billion through a rights offering amid investor concerns over the administration’s anti-renewable energy stance [2]. The project was expected to be fully operational in 2025, but with construction halted, its future is now in question.

The decision adds to a pattern of regulatory uncertainty under the Trump administration, which has increasingly scrutinized offshore wind developments. This is the second major offshore wind project to be halted, following the temporary stop-work order on Empire Wind off the coast of New York [2]. The lack of a clear and consistent energy policy has raised concerns among developers about the long-term viability of large-scale clean energy projects in the U.S.

EU Green Deal obligations must be supported by economic incentives and capacity building to facilitate Asia’s green transition.","The European Union and the Asia Pacific are pivotal in tackling climate change, together accounting for almost 70 per cent of global emissions. The regions’ combined strengths and expanding climate and energy partnerships (CEPs) create opportunities to advance common environmental objectives, deepen and diversify international cooperation and accelerate the green transition.

CEPs are essential for driving decarbonisation, bridging climate finance gaps, expanding clean energy systems and promoting sustainable development. But upgrading their scale, scope and stringency, sustained political commitment and the coupling of obligations with incentives are needed to meaningfully translate ambition into action.

The European Union is spearheading the green transition. Emissions decreased almost 37 per cent since 1990. Renewable generation has nearly tripled since 2004 and now represents almost half of electricity. Domestic transformation increasingly coincides with external environmental cooperation — CEPs promote the EU green agenda abroad, and environmental objectives are embedded into trade and strategic arrangements, alongside sustainability due diligence, deforestation and carbon border adjustment instruments.

CEPs are critical for the Asia Pacific, which is responsible for an increasing share of emissions and dangerously exposed to climate change. Coal accounts for 57 per cent of electricity, production surged 202 per cent since 2000, and the region hosts three quarters of coal plants. Extreme weather affected 48 million people and drove losses of US$35.6 billion in 2021. Air pollution causes 4.5 million premature deaths annually, 70 per cent of the global total.

The European Union and the Asia Pacific have complementary strengths. The EU Green Deal offers diverse climate policy tools. The European Union is the largest contributor to climate finance, which has almost tripled since 2013, and has a longstanding record in tackling climate change domestically and internationally. The ‘Brussels effect’ uses market and regulatory power to raise global environmental standards.

The Asia Pacific is the world’s growth engine and industrial powerhouse. The region hosts three in four STEM graduates worldwide. Its share of the global economy and manufacturing has nearly doubled since the 1990s. Average infrastructural investment in emerging Asia is seven times the OECD average. ASEAN environmental integration is deepening, and the number of trade agreements in the region has leapt from eight to almost 150 since 2000.

Brussels increasingly integrates sustainability into its trade policies. 16 of 24 bilateral agreements with Asia Pacific countries contain Trade and Sustainable Development chapters. These are now systematically included in EU agreements, and increasingly contain stronger implementation measures and enforceable commitments. Two of the EU–ASEAN Strategic Partnership’s four pillars focus on climate and environmental sustainability. But deepening existing commitments, entering the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and upgrading interregional platforms would improve effectiveness.

Since 2021, the European Union has developed targeted green cooperation instruments, including 37 Asia Pacific environmental partnerships, encompassing raw materials, green technologies, climate finance, development cooperation and green alliances.

Raw materials partnerships target critical minerals fuelling the green transition. Since the Critical Raw Materials Act in March 2023, Brussels has signed 10 of 14 existing partnerships, including with Australia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. These agreements aim to meet rising demand, diversify supply and support climate goals. But stronger environmental safeguards and opportunities to move up the value chain are needed.

Hydrogen will prove essential to decarbonise hard-to-abate industrial sectors and facilitate energy storage. The EU has established hydrogen partnerships with Japan and Kazakhstan, to invest in joint research, co-develop infrastructure, set standards and harmonise regulations and manage supply chains.

The EU Global Gateway mobilises tailored development assistance towards the green transition, including Central Asian transport corridors and Pacific disaster risk resilience. But while programs like the US$11.7 billion for improving ASEAN energy markets reflect the scale of ambition required, others fall short.

Just Energy Transition Partnerships compensate the early retirement of coal plants and fund renewables. The Asia Pacific hosts two of four active JETPs, with US$20 billion pledged to Indonesia and US$15.8 billion to Vietnam. With just US$16 billion, Indonesia could meet its 2050 renewables target by 2030. However, contributions have been slow to materialise, with only 1 per cent pledged funds for Indonesia delivered by December 2024.

Green alliances provide frameworks for deepening environmental cooperation. The European Union has reached bilateral agreements with Japan and South Korea and an interregional Green-Blue Alliance for the Pacific. These advance common sustainability priorities, build capacity and coherence and align socioeconomic and environmental objectives. But further attention is needed to operationalise commitments.

Alongside the emerging Global Energy Transitions Forum and Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships, the expanding suite of CEPs holds considerable potential to advance the green transition. By combining EU financial resources and regulatory strengths with the Asia Pacific’s industrial capacity, infrastructural heft and skills base, CEPs can unlock synergies and allow both regions to advance their climate ambitions.

Yet immediate pressures like debt repayments in Asia and security concerns in the EU risk diverting attention and resources away from climate. EU Green Deal obligations must be supported by economic incentives and capacity building to facilitate Asia’s green transition.

CEPs should strategically target highest-impact areas where environmental and socioeconomic goals align, like carbon market development and cross-border energy infrastructure. Broadening CEPs’ scope to prioritise interregional fora and bridging formulation with implementation will prove key. By translating shared ambition into more concrete action through CEPs, the European Union and Asia Pacific can deepen environmental cooperation and make tangible progress towards a greener future.

New technology from Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials has enabled an innovative measuring technique that can support these powerful batteries, as Interesting Engineering reported recently.

The technology relies on impedance spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy allows scientists to study electrical materials by measuring their resistance to current, or impedance, at a variety of frequencies.

According to Interesting Engineering, the new technology can detect heat early enough to shut down batteries and avoid damage. It can also improve EV charging by optimizing for slower or faster charging based on the length of the charge session.

Older versions of impedance spectroscopy were only possible while batteries were at rest. With the Fraunhofer Institute's innovation, batteries can now be examined while in use, saving time and offering crucial data about the battery's health and performance, while taking measurements at up to a million times per second.

Hermann Pleteit, the project's lead, said, ""[D]ynamic impedance spectroscopy opens up new possibilities for optimizing battery management, thereby extending the batteries' lifespan. It also paves the way for these batteries to be used in safety-critical applications.""

Improved batteries in EVs can help reduce harmful pollution from gas-burning vehicles. Although the EV manufacturing process can be energy-intensive, MIT Climate Portal has reported that EVs are responsible for much less pollution over their lifetimes than traditional vehicles.

Stronger, more reliable, and longer-lasting batteries also help build energy storage capabilities. When combined with renewable energy sources such as wind or solar, better energy storage can ensure a secure grid powered by clean energy.

Bundling solar energy with battery technology has proven an effective strategy for keeping energy running at home. In Puerto Rico, this combination has helped to take some burden off the grid or to provide power in peak summer heat.

The researchers noted that the enhanced ability to analyze battery health is not restricted to lithium-ion batteries. Other battery types, like sodium-ion and lithium-sulfur batteries, can also benefit from their innovation.

Chuck Schumer and Gov.","The Trump administration halted construction on a nearly complete offshore wind project near Rhode Island as the White House continues to attack the battered U.S. offshore wind industry that scientists say is crucial to the urgent fight against climate change.

Danish wind farm developer Orsted says the Revolution Wind project is about 80% complete, with 45 out of its 65 turbines already installed.

Despite that progress — and the fact that the project had cleared years of federal and state reviews — the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the order Friday, saying the federal government needs to review the project and “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

It did not specify what the national security concerns are.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site this week.

Scientists across the globe agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind” in a post on X. Both governors are Democrats.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Orsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the U.S. and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

“Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power. That is not enough to meet America’s rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies,” said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a group that supports offshore oil, gas and wind.

Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes the offshore wind industry, applauded the BOEM’s decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the nonprofit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the White House has halted. Work was stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,” said Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

Offshore construction on Revolution Wind started last year, following the final federal approval from BOEM. Currently, the project is nearing completion with all offshore foundations and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

According to a Notice to Mariners issued on 18 August, Bokalift 2 and supporting vessels were scheduled to arrive at the site on or around 22 August for offshore substation installation, with the vessel White Marlin transporting the topside to the site. The AIS data available online shows Bokalift 2 is currently anchored at Jamestown Port but White Marlin is shown as sailing towards the project site.

In the order halting all ongoing Revolution Wind-related activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), issued on 22 August, BOEM’s Acting Director states that this would allow time for BOEM “to address concerns that have arisen during the review that the Department is undertaking pursuant to the President’s Memorandum of January 20, 2025”.

According to the document, the Bureau is particularly focused on addressing “concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas”, as described in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA).

Following the stop-work order, Ørsted said its subsidiary Revolution Wind LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Skyborn Renewables, was complying with the order and taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.

“Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously. This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026”, the company said in a press release published on 23 August (CEST time).

The developer also highlighted that Revolution Wind was a fully permitted project, having secured all required federal and state permits “including its Construction and Operations Plan approval letter on 17 November 2023 following reviews that began more than nine years ago“.

“Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states. Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind”, the developer said.

The company also pointed out that its fully operational South Fork Wind, which is adjacent to Revolution Wind and uses the same wind turbine technology, delivered energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53 per cent for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.

The 704 MW Revolution Wind, which will comprise 65 Siemens Gamesa SG 11.0-200 DD wind turbines, has 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut.

The move from the US Department of the Interior sparked backlash from the industry for the second time this year because of a stop-work order for a project in construction, following the same decision made for Equinor’s Empire Wind 1 earlier this year.

The order for Empire Wind 1 was rescinded around a month after it was issued, following discussions between the New York Governor and the White House, which reportedly led to a compromise where New York Governor agreed to revise a previous decision on new gas pipeline capacity.

The renewable energy industry in the US has called the stop-work order for Revolution Wind “unlawful” and a product of “extreme partisan politics”.

“For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction—this time one that is nearly 80% complete”, said Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network.

“This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities—shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance. In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.”

Oceantic Network urged the Department of the Interior “to reverse course immediately” and allow the 704 MW offshore wind project to move forward.

CEO of American Clean Power Association (ACP), Jason Grumet, said stopping construction when the offshore wind farm is 80 per cent complete, was more than a bureaucratic delay. “[It’s] a broken promise to the communities, workers, consumers, and businesses counting on this project.”

“This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy. The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments”, Jason Grumet said.

“Here again, the Trump Administration is raising alarms about rising energy prices while blocking new supply from reaching the grid. Taking jobs away from American families while raising their energy bills is not leadership. American workers and consumers deserve better.”

The New Mexico Economic Development Department recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Pacific Fusion. This means the energy company will pursue plans to develop a research and development center in Albuquerque.

New Mexico is primed for a surge in clean energy projects, particularly fusion energy, if the project is successful. Breakthroughs in this technology have already been made by Sandia National Laboratories, which is based in the state. Pacific Fusion is building off the lab's innovations.

""New Mexico is a natural fit for this project,"" Keith LeChien, co-founder and chief technology officer at Pacific Fusion, told OK Energy Today. ""The Z Machine at Sandia National Laboratories helped lay the foundation for our approach, and the state's legacy of applied physics innovation, deep talent pool, and business-friendly environment put it in a unique position to become a national leader in fusion energy innovation.""

Fusion is the process of combining two atomic nuclei and harnessing the energy released from the process. This is similar to how the sun and stars work. A pickup truck filled with fusion energy is equivalent to 10 million barrels of oil, according to the Department of Energy.

Fusion has the potential to provide virtually limitless energy without contributing to air pollution like fossil fuels. Dirty energy can put people at higher risk for issues with cognitive functioning, respiratory problems, or fatty liver disease.

Alongside solar and wind, fusion is a promising source of alternative energy as the world seeks cleaner sources to combat climate change. It can solve the problem of rising energy costs and low supply due to unstable power grids.

Pacific Fusion's continued work puts New Mexico closer to delivering carbon-free electricity to the grid. It could also help stimulate the local economy. Once the deal is finalized, the new facility will bring an estimated $1 billion investment and 200 permanent jobs to the area.

""New Mexico is on the brink of an economic development surge that will demand more energy than ever,"" state Sen. Michael Padilla told OK Energy Today.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

The project had been delayed due to unspecified reasons. Energy Transfer operates the facility, which is designed to liquefy and export natural gas.

Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) saw a modest increase in its stock price on August 19, rising by 0.20% with a trading volume of $0.31 billion, ranking 327th in market activity [1]. This gain was driven by the announcement of a long-term LNG sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with JERA, Japan's top importer. The agreement, announced on August 8, signals operational stability and aligns with Cheniere's strategy to secure offtake commitments amid shifting global demand. The SPA highlights Cheniere's ability to attract major buyers, reducing exposure to volatile spot markets through extended pricing and demand guarantees [1].

In parallel, the US Department of Energy granted Energy Transfer an extension to start exports from the Lake Charles LNG facility in Louisiana. The completion date has been pushed to December 2031, reflecting unspecified delays. The facility is designed to liquefy and export natural gas. This extension is a significant development for the US natural gas market, as it impacts regional export capacity and energy security [2].

Additionally, Italian energy firm Eni aims to produce around 120 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas from two new wells at Egypt’s Zohr field in the Mediterranean by November, according to a government official cited by Asharq Business on August 20. The additional drilling project is part of Eni’s agreement with the Petroleum Ministry to offset natural production decline and maintain output levels [2]. Meanwhile, US-based Apache Corporation announced plans to boost its natural gas production in Egypt by 70 mmcfd in Q4 2025, following the completion of new processing and infrastructure upgrades in the Western Desert [2].

These developments underscore the strategic importance of LNG and natural gas in the global energy market, as well as the ongoing efforts of major energy players to secure long-term supply agreements and stabilize production. Investors and financial professionals should closely monitor these trends and their potential impacts on the energy sector.

As global demand for clean energy accelerates, companies like Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) face a dual challenge: capitalizing on long-term structural growth while navigating near-term headwinds from macroeconomic volatility and regulatory uncertainty. For investors, the question is whether ENPH is a speculative bet or a strategic long-term play in the evolving clean energy transition.

Enphase's Financial Resilience and Strategic Positioning

Enphase's Q2 2025 results underscore its ability to thrive in a competitive market. Revenue rose to $363.2 million, driven by 11% growth in Europe and 3% in the U.S., with record battery shipments of 190.9 MWh. The company's gross margins—46.9% GAAP and 48.6% non-GAAP—were bolstered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, which contributed 11.4% to its non-GAAP margin. However, excluding IRA benefits, margins fell to 37.2%, highlighting its reliance on U.S. policy tailwinds.

Enphase's product innovation is a key differentiator. The launch of the IQ Battery 10C, with 30% higher energy density and reduced installation costs, and the expansion of its IQ Balcony Solar Kit in Europe, demonstrate its focus on solving customer pain points. Meanwhile, its U.S.-manufactured microinverters—eligible for 45X tax credits—position it to benefit from domestic supply chain incentives.

Macro Risks and Opportunities

The renewable energy sector is highly sensitive to interest rates and inflation. In 2025, falling U.S. rates and subsiding inflation are expected to reduce financing costs for solar projects, potentially boosting demand. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) notes that high rates in 2024 suppressed residential installations, but rate cuts in late 2024 have already signaled a recovery. For Enphase, this means improved affordability for its battery and solar storage solutions, which require upfront capital.

However, policy risks persist. While the IRA's tax credits have been extended beyond 2028, regulatory shifts—such as changes to net metering or interconnection delays—could dampen growth. Enphase's 11.4% margin boost from IRA benefits underscores its vulnerability to policy reversals. Similarly, reciprocal tariffs and rising battery import costs threaten short-term margins, though the company's domestic manufacturing strategy offers a buffer.

In Europe, the EU's 2030 renewable target of 42.5% and infrastructure investments under the REPowerEU Plan create tailwinds. Enphase's expansion into 18 new European markets, including Greece and Ireland, aligns with this momentum. Yet, the region's fragmented regulatory landscape and slower adoption of solar storage compared to the U.S. pose challenges.

Strategic vs. Speculative: A Balanced View

Enphase's financials and product pipeline suggest a strategic long-term play. Its strong free cash flow ($18.4 million in Q2), $1.53 billion in liquidity, and disciplined capital spending ($8.2 million in Q2) reflect operational discipline. Share repurchases of $30 million in Q2 further signal management's confidence in its valuation.

However, the stock's valuation metrics—pegged at 0.7x PEG ratio—hint at undervaluation relative to growth potential, but also expose it to volatility. The company's reliance on IRA incentives and its exposure to margin compression from R&D and SG&A costs (which totaled $128.6 million in Q2) require careful monitoring.

Investment Thesis

For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, Enphase offers a compelling mix of innovation and resilience. Its leadership in microinverters and solar storage, coupled with IRA-driven domestic production, positions it to benefit from the U.S. clean energy boom. The European expansion also diversifies its revenue base, mitigating regional risks.

Yet, the stock is not without risks. Policy shifts, margin pressures from tariffs, and macroeconomic volatility could weigh on short-term performance. A diversified portfolio approach—pairing ENPH with broader clean energy ETFs or less policy-dependent renewables—may balance these risks.

Conclusion

Enphase Energy is neither a pure speculative play nor a guaranteed long-term winner. It is a company navigating the dual forces of innovation and regulation in a sector defined by rapid change. For investors who can stomach near-term volatility and believe in the long-term trajectory of distributed energy, ENPH represents a strategic bet on the future of clean power. However, those seeking immediate returns may find the stock's exposure to macroeconomic and policy risks too unpredictable.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 20:01:42.664857

As monetary policy tightens and regulatory frameworks evolve, renewables are becoming both a hedge against inflation and a vehicle for long-term growth.","The recent 36% surge in Sunrun Inc. (RUN) shares on August 21, 2025, reflects a rare alignment of regulatory clarity, monetary policy recalibration, and sector-specific tailwinds. For investors, this move underscores a critical lesson: strategic entry points in high-growth renewables sectors emerge when shifting policy frameworks and macroeconomic dynamics create asymmetries in risk and reward.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Tax Credit Clarity Fuels Solar Optimism

The U.S. Treasury and IRS's revised guidelines for clean energy tax credits have been a game-changer for Sunrun. By maintaining eligibility for residential solar projects under existing rules—while imposing stricter criteria for larger-scale developments—the administration has effectively shielded Sunrun's core business model from overhangs. This clarity has unlocked cost reductions and accelerated deployment timelines, directly boosting the company's cash flow potential. Analysts at RBC and Wells Fargo have upgraded RUN to “Outperform,” citing improved project economics and a 59.9% gross margin as key differentiators.

The regulatory environment now favors distributed solar solutions, which Sunrun has mastered through its third-party ownership model. As the sector grapples with the Inflation Reduction Act's evolving implementation, Sunrun's agility in navigating tax incentives positions it as a beneficiary of policy-driven demand. This is not merely a short-term rally; it reflects a structural shift in how regulators are prioritizing residential decarbonization.

Monetary Policy: High Rates and the Paradox of Renewable Valuations

While the Federal Reserve's 5.33% federal funds rate—a 20-year high—typically deters capital-intensive sectors, the renewable energy market has shown resilience. A structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) analysis of U.S. data from 1990 to 2023 reveals that solar energy is the most sensitive to monetary policy shocks. Yet, Sunrun's stock has defied conventional wisdom, rising despite elevated borrowing costs. How?

The answer lies in the interplay between policy and market psychology. The Fed's restrictive stance has compressed valuations across many sectors, but renewables have retained their allure due to their dual role as climate solutions and long-term infrastructure plays. Sunrun's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3 and its focus on high-margin residential projects mitigate the drag of high rates. Moreover, the market is pricing in a potential pivot by the Fed as inflation moderates—a pivot that could unlock further valuation expansion for renewables.

Strategic Entry Points: Balancing Risk and Reward

For investors, the current environment presents a unique inflection point. Sunrun's recent performance—driven by a 70% storage attachment rate and record Q2 revenue of $569.3 million—demonstrates its ability to scale profitably even in a high-rate environment. However, the stock's technical indicators (RSI at 72.21, MACD at 1.3187) suggest overbought conditions, signaling caution for short-term traders.

The key to a strategic entry lies in diversifying exposure across the renewable energy value chain. While Sunrun benefits from residential solar, broader sector gains—such as those seen in First Solar and Enphase Energy—highlight the importance of a basket approach. Investors should also monitor the Fed's inflation trajectory and the pace of global clean energy commitments (e.g., EU and China's solar expansion plans), which could amplify sector momentum.

Investment Advice: Positioning for the Energy Transition

Hedge Against Rate Volatility: Allocate a portion of your portfolio to high-quality renewables with strong balance sheets (like Sunrun) while hedging against interest rate swings via short-duration bonds or rate-sensitive ETFs.

Leverage Policy Catalysts: Watch for upcoming updates to the Inflation Reduction Act's implementation and state-level clean energy mandates, which could drive further demand for residential solar.

Technical and Fundamental Alignment: Use Sunrun's current overbought RSI as a signal to take partial profits, but maintain a core position given its long-term growth drivers.

Conclusion: A New Paradigm for Renewable Investing

Sunrun's stock rally is not an isolated event but a symptom of a broader shift. As monetary policy tightens and regulatory frameworks evolve, renewables are becoming both a hedge against inflation and a vehicle for long-term growth. For investors, the challenge is to identify companies like Sunrun that can navigate these dual forces—leveraging policy tailwinds while maintaining financial discipline. The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon; it is a present-day opportunity, and those who act with clarity and foresight will be well-positioned to capitalize on it.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 20:01:46.198235

One vehicle stands as the cheapest of the bunch, though, as Nissan recently unveiled the pricing structure for the 2026 Leaf, and it's still the cheapest EV in America, retailing for less than $30,000, even without tax credits. As for the second most affordable EV? That would be the Fiat 500e, a battery-powered take on an old favorite of driving schools and rental fleets. If you're looking at price alone, the Leaf beats out the Fiat by a few hundred bucks, but is it actually the best deal on the EV market right now? Or is the 500e secretly punching above its weight class?

This May Be The Easiest Spec Comparison We've Ever Made

To take a quick look at the performance specs for these two cars...

With the Nissan Leaf, you're getting 174 hp and 254 lb-ft of torque in the base RWD S+ model. The higher trims, the SV+, and the Platinum+, will bump you up to 214 hp and 261 lb-ft of torque. The trade-off for that extra power is a few miles of range, with the S+ doing 303 miles, the SV+ doing 288 miles, and the Platinum+ coming in at 259 miles with a full battery. Note that the Leaf will also be available with a larger battery pack option, and we still have to wait and see how these numbers shake out across the lineup once the EPA gets its hands on the car.

Based on specs alone, it's not hard to pick a winner between these two models. The cheapest version of the Leaf has a 57-horse lead on the 500e. All Fiat 500e models come with the same 400v front-wheel drive electric motor and the same one-speed gearbox, so, unless you want to get in there and add some extra electric motors of your own, what you see is what you get.

The Fiat 500e's 149-mile range feels paltry in comparison to modern EVs, even if we keep it to the sub-$35,000 range. 149 miles is the EPA estimate, while Fiat says you might be able to get 162 miles out of a full charge. Even if we want to be nice and go with the Fiat estimate, that's still not great. In fact, if you're not familiar with the 500e's specs, you might find that number downright startling, like finding out that the Mitsubishi Mirage only makes 78 horsepower. There's no polite way to put it: these numbers just won't do in 2025.

In The 500e's Defense, It's Surprisingly Fun To Drive

The Fiat 500e feels a decade behind the times when it comes to performance specs, but when we get our hands on one of these cars for review, we're usually grateful for the experience. Test-driving the 2024 model, we called it a ""peppy little hatchback,"" with a lot of ""street-level charisma."" It's an adorable-looking car, too, calling to mind classic European city cars like the Mini Cooper, the Volkswagen Beetle, and any number of Citroëns, Renaults, and Peugeots. If you like micros and kei cars, this is about as close as you're going to get in an electric car that's been cleared for takeoff on American highways.

That being said, the Nissan Leaf is the superior car in every single category besides being adorable. In our prototype test-drive for the 2026 Leaf, we liked the effortless handling, and we found the car to be ""brisk,"" if not exactly sporty. You're not going to be winning any drag races, but you won't be hesitant to pass slowpokes on the highway, either.

Do we even have to say it? The Leaf wins round one.

The Fiat 500e Is A Charming Little City Car, But The Leaf Is Obviously More Versatile

In some ways, it's unfair to compare the Fiat 500e and the Nissan Leaf directly. The Leaf will get you at least 250-something miles on a single charge, and, depending on your options, weighs somewhere in the area of 3,500 lbs and makes for a comfortable drive on the highway. Meanwhile, the 500e weighs in at around 3,000 lbs, averages 162 miles of range on a single charge, if we're being generous, and is better suited to short trips and city living.

If your commute involves highway miles, if the trip to your favorite grocery store has you planning to be on the road for upwards of 20 minutes, we can flat out recommend the Leaf, hands-down. Where the Fiat 500e might have the advantage is in its nimble size, bringing to mind nothing so much as a Micro-Machine miniature. Let's check the basic physical dimensions of these cars...

Arguing the Fiat 500e's smaller size as a positive may sound like we're just looking for nice things to say about the car, but being able to make a three-point turn inside a broom closet isn't such a bad thing for someone who does most of their driving in the city. In some ways, it really is unfair to put these two cars head-to-head. For the vast majority of American drivers, the Leaf is the obvious winner, but it's not hard to see the appeal of the Fiat 500e for drivers who spend most of their road-time on busy city streets.

The Nissan Leaf Is Cheaper, Too

Comparing prices across both of these models, here's what we get...

Note that we're looking at 2026 pricing for the Leaf, and 2025 pricing for the Fiat... and it still shows the Nissan Leaf as the more affordable model for the base trim.

The Nissan Leaf is the clear winner in every category for this comparison, but it might make more sense to compare the Leaf to, say, the Equinox EV, selling for $33,600 for the 2025 model year, with a starting power output of 213 hp, and an estimated range of 319 miles. Or the Mustang Mach-E, selling for $36,495 with a 264-hp powertrain and 250 miles of range in the base model.

The Leaf is definitely a bargain at an MSRP below $30,000, but that doesn't mean it's the only great cheap EV out there.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nissan-leaf-fiat-500e-main.png,N,,2025-08-23 19:02:58.906439

July marked the fifth consecutive month of increasing new car values, confirming an ongoing shortage of used car supply relative to consumer demand. As recently as August 2024 used car prices have dropped 4.8% ($1,509).

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed 1.5 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in July 2024 and July 2025 to identify used pricing trends, and found that while used car values continue to rise used electric car values are still falling, though their drop of 1.3% in July suggests used EV prices are finding stability after years of decline.

“Just as used electric vehicle prices are stabilizing, traditional used cars are going back up in value,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer. “The combination of high new car prices, plus concern over tariffs and their impact on future car values, is likely leading to increased near-term demand for both new and used vehicles.”

Used Car Prices: They Just Keep Climbing

What started in March as the first month of increasing used car prices in over 2.5 years has turned into a 5-month trend. Used car values have not only been rising, but rising by a higher percentage every month since March, until the rate of increase dropped slightly in July. But even the moderate 3.7% bump in July still translates to nearly a $1,200 increase in what consumers have to pay for the average 1- to 5-year-old used car.

“Consumer demand for used cars remains strong, outstripping supply and driving prices up for five months in a row,” said Brauer. “For buyers waiting to get a deal on used cars, it appears they waited too long if they didn’t buy before March.”

Used Electric Vehicle Prices: Finally Finding Their Footing?

Electric vehicle prices were falling by more than 24%, or over $8,700, a year ago, but in July they dropped just 1.3%, or $408. This is the smallest decline in used EV values in over two years, suggesting the market has finally found a balance between used electric car supply and consumer demand.

“It’s interesting to see electric vehicle prices stabilizing just as the tax incentives for new and used models are withdrawn,” said Brauer. “It’s likely we’ll see a last-minute increase in both new and used EV purchases before the incentives vanish, followed by a decline in sales and demand. That could cause a short-term drop in prices right after the incentives go away, but also a longer-term increase, as fewer EV sales will ultimately mean a lower supply and a likely increase in values.”

Which Brand Lost the Most Value? (Hint: Tesla)

When ranked by brands with the biggest used car price drops , Tesla tops the list with a 5.3% drop in value over the past year. Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, and Nissan also lost value in the past 12 months, while every other brand gained value.

“With used electric vehicle prices still dropping and Tesla having the largest share of the used EV market, it’s not surprising to see that brand losing the most value,” said Brauer. “More surprising is Infiniti gaining the most value, followed by Land Rover. These brands have led in lost used car value in the past and likely benefitted the most from the reversal of overall used car pricing over the past five months.”

The Top 20 Used Models Seeing Increased Value

Luxury models from brands like BMW, Land Rover, and Porsche lead the list of used cars that have gained the most value over the past year. A few high-volume, low-cost cars, including the Chevrolet Trax and Kia Niro, also made the list, but premium models dominate the gains in used car prices.

“The preponderance of higher-priced used luxury models gaining value suggests many of the consumers driving up used car values are former new car buyers who have switched to the used car market and are willing to spend a fair bit of money to get the vehicle they want,” said Brauer.

Top 20 Used Cars With the Biggest Price Drops

Tesla holds the first three spots on the list of used cars losing the most value, with the Model S, Y, and X all losing more than 12% in value. Ford’s Explorer Hybrid and Jeep’s Gladiator follow in spots four and five, with all of the top five vehicles losing between $3,224 and $6,662 over the past year.

“Luxury models dominate the list of cars losing value too, showing the wider swings these vehicles suffer when they are in either high or low demand,” said Brauer.“

“The factors impacting used car values, including limited supply and concern over tariffs, makes predicting future pricing trends difficult,” said Brauer. “But the pullback in used car value increases last month suggests we may see some moderation in their growth for the remainder of 2025.”

By Parvaiz Bukhari / AFP, NEW DELHI

Non-fossil fuels now account for half of India’s installed energy capacity — years ahead of schedule — but the third-largest greenhouse gas polluter remains deeply reliant on coal for electricity generation.

“A landmark in India’s energy transition journey,” Indian Minister of Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi sid after the world’s most populous nation released figures last month.

“Five years early,” he added, referring to India’s 2030 target under the Paris Agreement, and marking a step to the country’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2070.

However, while the 50 percent milestone is significant, climate expert Avantika Goswami said the figures — which refer only to potential energy production — tell just part of the story.

“Overall, actual generation from renewable sources is still quite low,” Goswami said from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.

The reason is stark: Nearly three-quarters of electricity continues to come from heavily polluting coal-burning power plants.

The challenge becomes even more apparent when examining India’s continued dependence on coal. Far from decreasing its usage, the globe’s second-largest consumer of coal pushed up production of the dirty fossil fuel by five percent last year, mining 1 billion tonnes, according to the coal ministry.

“Coal remains crucial,” the Indian Ministry of Coal said.

The stance highlights the practical challenges of India’s energy transition. Coal is needed to fulfil power demands while storage capacity lags behind the surge in renewable sources of power.

“The coal sector remains a crucial contributor to India’s energy mix, powering over 74 percent of the country’s electricity and sustaining key industries like steel and cement,” the coal ministry said, celebrating what it dubbed “India’s coal boom.”

This reliance places India in a challenging position globally. The country ranks behind only China and the US for carbon emissions overall.

However, analysts point out that in a country of 1.4 billion people, per capita emissions are only one-third of the global average, according to official figures.

“Looking at India’s per capita emissions, the effort it is making, India is doing pretty well,” said activist Harjeet Singh, head of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation.

India has set itself the daunting challenge of reducing emissions by 45 percent by 2030.

At the same time, electricity needs are expected to more than double by 2047, according to the country’s Center for Science and Environment.

Supplying some of that demand “is likely to be met by the addition of renewables”, Goswami said.

Half of India’s 484.8GW installed capacity is from non-fossil fuel sources.

The majority comes from solar, totaling 119GW — the third-largest level globally.

India is building one of the world’s largest solar and wind energy farms, spread over a desert the size of Singapore.

It is followed by hydro and wind, and also nuclear power — which makes up less than 2 percent of the total mix.

However, solar and wind create steady power only when the conditions are right, and India’s storage capacity is a meagre 505MWh — far lower than it can generate.

The storage bottleneck was not lost on the renewable energy minister.

Speaking at the inauguration of a battery storage systems plant in June, Joshi said India’s renewable energy potential was “growing fast” and “adding 25-30 GW every year.”

“But without storage, we will either waste that energy or fall back on coal when renewables dip,” he added.

Building storage based on batteries requires rare earth metals, with rival and neighbor China controlling 70 percent of the world’s supplies.

“We still remain dependent on China,” said Harjeet Singh, the climate activist.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (王毅) was in New Delhi for talks on Tuesday, with the supply of rare earth metals on the agenda.

One solution India is considering is pump-hydro energy storage projects.

When wind and solar plants produce excess energy, water is pumped into high reservoirs. That stored energy can then be released to generate power when demand surges.

However, Goswami believes the transition to cleaner power requires a multi-pronged approach.

The transition to cleaner power must come from “emission intensity reduction” of often inefficient coal plants, combined with better integrated renewable energy in the grid that “will actually make the shift happen,” he said.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/08/24/P09-250824-311.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 20:00:49.283454

The company earlier this month saw its shares plunge after announcing a $9.4 billion rights offering, citing investor concerns over President Trump’s opposition to wind power.
As a member of the New England electricity grid, power plants in Connecticut produce more electricity than Connecticut residents use each year.
The decision to stop the Revolution Wind project, which is 80 percent compete and has already been approved through exhaustive reviews by multiple federal agencies, has nothing to do with energy policy or energy prices.
“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women.","Revolution Wind, a $4 billion, 704-megawatt offshore wind farm under construction about 15 miles south of Rhode Island that is designed to power more than 350,000 homes, has been abruptly halted by the Trump administration.

A letter issued late Friday by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered work stopped, despite the project being more than 80% complete and promising both clean energy and economic benefits for southern New England.

Ørsted, the project’s lead developer, confirmed the directive Friday, saying it is “complying with the order and taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment,” while also evaluating regulatory and legal options to resolve the matter. The company earlier this month saw its shares plunge after announcing a $9.4 billion rights offering, citing investor concerns over President Trump’s opposition to wind power.

Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, called the move “deeply troubling,” warning that billions of dollars in nearly completed facilities are now at risk due to abrupt policy reversals.

The project, which has already seen a $4 billion investment, had foundations in place and 45 of 65 turbines installed in federal waters south of Rhode Island. It was projected to cut over one million metric tons of carbon pollution annually — the equivalent of taking 150,000 cars off the road.

Revolution Wind secured 20-year power-purchase agreements with local utilities in 2019 and was endorsed by both Rhode Island and Connecticut regulators as a cornerstone of their climate goals, supporting Rhode Island’s ambitious 100% renewable target by 2033 and Connecticut’s zero-carbon electricity grid by 2040. The project was seen as a major opportunity to expand offshore wind, diversify the region’s energy mix, reduce dependence on natural gas, and help stabilize New England’s historically volatile winter electricity prices.

Halting the completion of the project not only jeopardizes billions of dollars in nearly finished infrastructure but also puts hundreds of local jobs and critical progress toward regional clean energy goals at risk.

“New England needs forward momentum, not sudden stops that hurt both consumers and suppliers,” said Dolan, emphasizing that energy investments require policy certainty, market stability, and clear, consistent siting rules. “When projects like Revolution Wind have met every legal requirement, secured financing, and obtained a Capacity Supply Obligation, they should not face the rules being changed midstream,” he added, noting that such actions erode investor confidence and threaten long-term electric reliability.

He stressed that the region must continue building new energy infrastructure — whether conventional power plants, offshore wind, advanced nuclear, or other technologies — to meet growing demand.

The directive, issued in the letter from acting BOEM Director Matt Giacona, cited a January 20 memorandum signed by President Trump stating unspecified concerns related to “national security interests” and “prevention of the interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas.”

Rejecting the Trump administration’s rationale, US Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said he had been in contact Saturday with Ørsted’s leadership, his Connecticut and Rhode Island congressional colleagues, and representatives of the building trades.

“The claim by the administration that national security concerns have arisen is particularly galling, given that BOEM and the US Coast Guard meticulously analyzed the protection of US interests as part of the record of decision years ago,” Courtney said, noting that the review ensured that transit by Coast Guard vessels and US Navy warships would not be hindered by the placement of Revolution Wind turbines.

Courtney added that if the order is carried out, it would terminate the jobs of about 200 workers in the trades, among the industry’s suppliers, and from tugboat crews, while also canceling a critical expansion of energy capacity negotiated below the cost of current wind projects.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee condemned the Trump administration’s announcement.

“This political move … wastes years of state investment in renewable energy designed to diversify our energy supply and lower costs for families and businesses,” Lamont said.

McKee added, “This action puts hundreds of union jobs at risk … just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes.”

Both governors said they are working together to reverse the decision and save the project.

As a member of the New England electricity grid, power plants in Connecticut produce more electricity than Connecticut residents use each year.

Broken down by energy type, 58% of the electricity produced in Connecticut comes from Natural Gas, while 37% is from nuclear power. However, 85.5% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are from Natural Gas.

Connecticut uses about 24.5% of the energy produced for the New England grid, while the power generators located in the Nutmeg state provide 41% of all the electricity consumed in New England.The average residential price of electricity per KWh in Connecticut is 30.11 cents, according to FindEnergy.com, ranking the state 50th in the nation. The average monthly residential electricity bill is $211.14, ranking the state 52nd.

US Sen. Chris Murphy said Trump’s order was an example of corruption by the Trump administration.

“When the oil industry showed up at Mar a Lago with a set of demands in exchange for a $1 billion of campaign support for Trump, this is what they were asking for: the destruction of clean energy in America. The decision to stop the Revolution Wind project, which is 80 percent compete and has already been approved through exhaustive reviews by multiple federal agencies, has nothing to do with energy policy or energy prices. This is a story of corruption, plain and simple. President Trump has sold our country out to big corporations with the oil and gas industry at the top of the list,” Murphy said. “I will work with my colleagues and Governor Lamont to pursue all legal paths to get this project back on track.”

US Sen. Richard Blumenthal also released a statement decrying the Trump administration’s decision.

“As Connecticut families’ electric bills skyrocket, the Trump Administration is canceling critical clean energy projects that would lower utility bills and have created good paying union jobs for our state’s workforce,” he said. “This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it.”

Addressing the ET World Leaders Forum 2025, PM Modi noted that research is a major pillar of the nation's progress.

He noted that while imported research may suffice for survival, it cannot fulfil India's aspirations.

He emphasised the need for urgency and a focused mindset in the field of research, highlighting that the government has worked swiftly to promote research and has continuously developed the necessary policies and platforms.

Pointing out that until 2014, India's automobile exports stood at approximately Rs 50,000 crore annually, PM Modi highlighted that today, India exports automobiles worth Rs 1.2 lakh crore in a year. He remarked that India has now begun exporting metro coaches, rail coaches, and rail locomotives.

'I want to tell you about another success of India. India is now going to export electric vehicles to 100 countries of the world. A very big program related to this is also being held after 2 days on August 26,' he said.

New Delhi [India], August 24 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that India is set to achieve a milestone by exporting electric vehicles to 100 countries.

Addressing the ET World Leaders Forum 2025, PM Modi noted that research is a major pillar of the nation's progress.

He noted that while imported research may suffice for survival, it cannot fulfil India's aspirations.

He emphasised the need for urgency and a focused mindset in the field of research, highlighting that the government has worked swiftly to promote research and has continuously developed the necessary policies and platforms.

Pointing out that until 2014, India's automobile exports stood at approximately Rs 50,000 crore annually, PM Modi highlighted that today, India exports automobiles worth Rs 1.2 lakh crore in a year. He remarked that India has now begun exporting metro coaches, rail coaches, and rail locomotives.

'I want to tell you about another success of India. India is now going to export electric vehicles to 100 countries of the world. A very big program related to this is also being held after 2 days on August 26,' he said.

The Prime Minister emphasised that when the fundamentals of an economy are strong, its foundation is solid, then the impact is visible across all sectors.

In a statement, McKee said the stop-work order “undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability.
We will do everything we can to protect Rhode Island’s interests and help lower people’s energy bills,” said U.S.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said without Revolution Wind, “our Act on Climate is dead in the water.","PROVIDENCE – Gov. Dan McKee and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, along with other Rhode Island officials, on Aug. 23 condemned a decision by the Trump administration to halt construction of Revolution Wind, the wind farm being built south of the Rhode Island coast.

In a statement, McKee said the stop-work order “undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability. This action puts hundreds of union jobs at risk by halting a project that is 80% complete – just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.”

Said McKee: “At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs, and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption.”

McKee said construction of Revolution Wind, which began more than two years ago, was “key to Rhode Island’s economic development, energy security, and long-term affordability for our residents” and that he was working with Connecticut officials to pursue ""every avenue to reverse this decision.""

Connecticut governor: Move will drive up energy bills

In his own issued statement, Lamont said, “This political move by the Trump administration will drive up the cost of electricity bills and contradicts everything the administration has told us.”

The decision, Lamont said, “wastes years of state investment in renewable energy designed to diversify our energy supply and lower costs for families and businesses.”

The project, which was on track to be completed early next year, would have powered more than 350,000 homes across Connecticut and Rhode Island while creating good-paying, clean energy jobs, Lamont said – ”the very goals President Trump claims to support.”

“All of that is now at risk,” Lamont said.

In a letter sent Friday, Aug. 22, to Ørsted, the Danish company that is a partner on the joint venture developing the project, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a stop to all ongoing activities related to the 704-megawatt wind farm.

The bureau cited an executive order signed by Trump in January that aimed to rein in the expansion of offshore wind power in America.

At the time, industry experts believed the order would stop proposed projects from moving through the permitting process, but that it wouldn’t affect wind farms like Revolution Wind that were already under construction.

Reaction from RI's congressional delegation

Other public officials also weighed in on the Trump administration’s move.

Rhode Island's congressional delegation said in a joint statement: “We’re committed to ensuring Rhode Islanders have affordable electricity, but President Trump continues to recklessly increase energy prices.

""Halting this nearly completed project is unwarranted and unacceptable. We will do everything we can to protect Rhode Island’s interests and help lower people’s energy bills,” said U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, along with U.S. Representatives Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said without Revolution Wind, “our Act on Climate is dead in the water. With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate, the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2bzOEzYX74PnOnJpAXNzAQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-providence-journal/d52f3a7df33d9dbf9b08ab88748fdb88,N,,2025-08-23 21:59:13.227697

Sales data in 2025 consistently reflect a move toward EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). A May report from the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed particularly strong EV sales growth in the luxury sector, with EVs capturing 23% of the total luxury car market in Q1.

At the same time, Tesla — which appeared to have the EV market locked down in recent years — has experienced its share of setbacks, both in terms of volatile sales and its public image. In May, auto news site Jalopnik crowned the Lucid Air the ""go-to"" Tesla Model S alternative.

The outlet observed that Tesla functionally squandered its entrenched foothold on the all-electric market, a marketwide issue that could dissuade first-timers from making their next car an EV. Thankfully, following the second-best sales month on record in July, analysts anticipate EV sales will ""soar"" in Q3.

The rate of EV adoption isn't just a bulwark against high emissions by gas-guzzling conventional cars — going electric is a massive money saver, particularly when combined with home solar. EnergySage is a service that provides free, vetted local quotes and allows customers to save up to $10,000 on new solar panel installations.

But while Tesla falters, Electrek noted that Lucid's offerings ""continue to get smarter and more advanced,"" most recently via an over-the-air (OTA) update to its Lucid Air, a competitor to Tesla's flagship Model S.

Slated to begin on July 30, the OTA update gave Lucid Air drivers access to two features, Hands-Free Drive Assist and Hands-Free Lane Change Assist, the latter of which still required the driver to engage their turn signal manually.

Broadly, Lucid's update is part of the automaker's focus on advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS.

Dr. Kay Stepper is Lucid's Vice President of ADAS and autonomous driving. In a press release, Stepper said July's update was part of the maker's ""roadmap to continue to deliver significantly more functionality to our owners in the future.""

""The addition of these features to Lucid's DreamDrive Pro offers a glimpse into the future that Lucid is building,"" Stepper explained of the brand's ""software-defined vehicles.""

As many countries invest heavily in renewable energy, in a bid to decrease dependence on oil, gas, and coal, many traditional energy jobs are disappearing.
Around 67.5 million people were working in the energy sector globally in 2023, with around 34.8 million jobs in the renewable energy sector and 32.6 million jobs in the fossil fuel industry.
Several transition policies already exist across the region, such as the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2026–2030, “Advancing Regional Cooperation in Ensuring Energy Security and Accelerating Decarbonisation for a Just and Inclusive Energy Transition”.
While some coal workers have found jobs in the renewable energy sector, trade unions have raised concerns about the safety standards and wages in certain industries.","For years, energy workers from the fossil fuel sector have been growing increasingly concerned about their future working in the sector. As many countries invest heavily in renewable energy, in a bid to decrease dependence on oil, gas, and coal, many traditional energy jobs are disappearing. However, the knowledge and experience that workers in this sector hold could be well-suited to new jobs in the renewable energy industry, so long as governments invest in a just transition.

According to the European Union definition, a “Just transition is the term used to describe the transition to a climate-neutral economy while securing the future and livelihoods of workers and their communities. A just transition to a climate-neutral economy provides and guarantees better and decent jobs, social protection, more training opportunities and greater job security for all workers affected by global warming and climate change policies.” Meanwhile, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) says a just transition means “greening the economy in a way that is as fair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no one behind.”

Workers are key to the functioning of the global energy network. Those employed in both the fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors have the skills and experience needed to ensure that consumers have access to stable supplies of power and heating. Around 67.5 million people were working in the energy sector globally in 2023, with around 34.8 million jobs in the renewable energy sector and 32.6 million jobs in the fossil fuel industry.

In 2015, the ILO published Just Transition Guidelines, which included measures such as labour market policies to create new decent jobs and limit job losses, skills development, mechanisms for social dialogue, guidance on policy coherence, occupational safety and health policies, and social protection policies to safeguard workers. In 2023, the agency adopted a resolution based on the guidelines.

In Southeast Asia, a region that continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels, some governments have begun to invest in large-scale renewable energy projects, in some cases with support from international donors. The coal mining industry employs approximately 180,000, 86,000, and 4,000 people in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, respectively, while many workers in Malaysia are employed in the liquefied natural gas industry.

As the countries gradually decrease their dependence on fossil fuels, it will be important to train workers to transition to work in renewable energy projects to help avoid increased unemployment. Several transition policies already exist across the region, such as the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2026–2030, “Advancing Regional Cooperation in Ensuring Energy Security and Accelerating Decarbonisation for a Just and Inclusive Energy Transition”.

The 2021 launch of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) at COP26, which provides $20 billion and $15.5 billion to Indonesia and Vietnam, respectively, to phase out fossil fuels and increase the contribution of renewables, also supports this aim. However, the implementation of these policies is less simple due to pushback from fossil fuel lobbies, as well as a lack of funding and political will.

In India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer, workers' unions are increasingly demanding a just transition as the government gradually begins to close the country’s coal mines and more renewable energy capacity is deployed. There are around 300,000 permanent and 500,000 contract workers currently employed in India’s coal industry, while over 1.4 million people depend on the industry for their livelihoods.

While some coal workers have found jobs in the renewable energy sector, trade unions have raised concerns about the safety standards and wages in certain industries. For example, workers in solar farms face threats such as snake bites and electric shocks in the field, and many are paid extremely low wages, at around $ 3.2 a day.

Meanwhile, in the European Union, there are 31 coal regions in 11 EU countries, with around 200,000 workers employed in coal mines and power plants. To manage the just transition of these workers, the EU has introduced the COALition initiative, which brings together researchers, policymakers, businesses, and communities in regional hubs to shape locally tailored solutions. The EU aims to establish a regional framework for a just transition to ensure that all member states can successfully shift to green without the worry of high unemployment and economic burden.

Panagiotis Grammelis, the research director at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas in Greece, explained, “We are leaving the coal era and moving into the renewables era… We have common problems, common policy issues – and we want a common innovation model to address them.”

Several countries and regions of the world are establishing frameworks to support a just transition for workers in the energy sector. However, some regions are doing this in a more collaborative way than others. The success of these frameworks will come down to the effectiveness of implementation by individual state governments, but they could ultimately support a green transition, limit unemployment growth, and reduce training costs through the upskilling of workers.

The tech industry’s accelerating buildout of infrastructure to power artificial intelligence is rapidly turning an industry once lauded as “clean” and environmentally friendly into an air polluting, ecosystem destroying, water guzzling behemoth. Now, there’s an intensifying rift on the left about how to approach what was, until recently, a steadfast Democratic ally.

Progressives are now at a fork in the road with two very different options: a political reckoning with Silicon Valley or a rapprochement paid for with environmental havoc.

Some pundits and industry figures have counterintuitively argued that the proliferation of data centers to power AI is a good thing for the environment. The massive energy demand for training artificial intelligence will, in this telling, necessarily prompt a massive investment in clean energy and transmission infrastructure to meet that demand, thereby catalyzing a world-altering transition toward renewable energy. This argument, already suspect years ago, is entirely untenable now.

Following US President Donald Trump and company’s evisceration of the clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the narrow path of AI buildout being aligned with a green transition is now completely walled off. The choice now is whether the United States continues to aid and abet Silicon Valley’s environmental rampage or to fight it.

Even prior to Republicans torpedoing the IRA, AI electricity demand was growing faster than both renewable energy production and overall grid capacity. Without strong additionality regulations to require that new data centers be powered by the construction of new renewable energy generation, the AI boom will continue to increase consumption of fossil fuels.

Much of the increased energy demand was already being met by natural gas before the Republican spending package. It’s only going to get worse now. Without the clean energy tax credits, the advantages of incumbency that fossil fuels enjoy mean that the AI energy boom will further hook us on unsustainable resource consumption.

The firms building out AI infrastructure know this and often point to major investments in clean energy to protest characterizations of data centers as environmentally disastrous. But there are two major problems there. First, those investments may be in totally different locations than the actual data centers, meaning the centers are still consuming dirty energy. Second, and more importantly, at our present juncture in the climate crisis, we need to be actively decreasing our use of fossil fuels, not just containing increases in dirty energy production. (It’s worth noting that AI is also being used to enable more fossil fuel extraction.)

And the environmental destruction doesn’t stop there. The Trump White House recently moved to exempt data centers from environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, paving the way for tech companies to despoil local environments without a second thought, and limiting opportunities for the public to gain information about data centers’ environmental impacts.

Perhaps nothing captures the excesses of AI quite so clearly as its water usage. Despite some pundits glibly claiming that there’s actually tons of water to go around, data centers threaten to worsen already dire droughts. We’re already beginning to see this in arid places like Chile and the American Southwest.

The Colorado River’s mismanagement is the stuff of public policy legend at this point. Aquifers across the Western US are being depleted. People were not mulling the idea of partially rerouting the Mississippi River for giggles. There is, unequivocally, a water crisis unfolding. And those data centers are very, very thirsty. A single data center can use millions of gallons a day.

There are already more than 90 data centers in the Phoenix area alone. That’s hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day. Protesting that “there’s plenty of water” is not just detached from the drought-stricken reality, it’s dangerous.

Data centers are being built in arid places intentionally; the low humidity reduces the risk of corrosion for the processor stacks warehoused there. Fresh water supplies, when depleted, are not easily renewed. Devoting more of it to cooling GPUs means less for drinking, irrigation, fighting wildfires, bathing, and other essential uses.

And there isn’t a way to bring water to the arid environments to mitigate that, either. Some people point to desalination, but that isn’t tenable for multiple reasons. To start, most of these data centers tend to be inland, as the sea air has similar corrosive effects as humidity. That, in turn, means that even accepting desalination as a cure for water scarcity, data centers would require transporting massive quantities of that purified water over significant distances, which would require complex energy-and resource-consuming engineering projects unlikely to proceed within the hurry up and go of our AI bubblish moment. (Desalination also has its own serious environmental harms.)

At present, there is simply no way to have the scale of AI buildout that the United States is seeing without terrible environmental downsides. The only choice left is whether to get out of Silicon Valley’s way or whether to slow the industry’s pace.",https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/4821616136_d8af867f3b_b.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 10:04:15.309810

Retreating sea ice After increasing slightly during the first 35 years that satellite data was available, Antarctic sea ice cover plunged dramatically over the last decade.
That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.
Unlike sea ice, ice sheets and the ice shelves to which they are connected are on -- or supported by -- land.
""Unstoppable collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most concerning global tipping points,"" said Abram.","Abrupt and potentially irreversible changes in Antarctica driven by climate change could lift global oceans by meters and lead to ""catastrophic consequences for generations"", scientists warn.

More broadly, a state-of-knowledge review by a score of top experts revealed accelerating shifts across the region that are often both cause and effect of global warming, according to a study published in Nature.

""Antarctica is showing worrying signs of rapid change across its ice, ocean and ecosystems,"" lead author and Australian National University professor Nerilie Abram told AFP. ""Some of these abrupt changes will be difficult to stop.""

Shifts in different facets of Antarctica's climate system amplify each other and have accelerated the pace of warming globally as well, she said.

The study looked at evidence of abrupt change -- or ""regime shifts"" -- in sea ice, regional ocean currents, the continent's ice sheet and ice shelves, and marine life. It also examined how they interact.

Floating sea ice does not add to sea level when it melts. But its retreat does replace white surfaces that reflect almost all of the Sun's energy back into space with deep blue water, which absorbs the same amount instead.

Ninety percent of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.

Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers from the continent's shoreline. That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.

The ""overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice"" means that, on current trends, Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the study found.

This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction.

Over the last two years, for example, helpless emperor penguin chicks perished at multiple breeding grounds, drowning or freezing to death when sea ice gave way earlier than usual under their tiny feet.

Of five sites monitored in the Bellingshausen Sea region in 2023, all but one experienced a 100 percent loss of chicks, earlier research reported.

Unlike sea ice, ice sheets and the ice shelves to which they are connected are on -- or supported by -- land.

The world would need to heat up by five degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels to melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, which would lift global oceans an almost unimaginable 58 meters.

Point of no return

But global warming to date -- on average about 1.3C -- is fast approaching a threshold that would cause part of the ice sheet to generate at least three meters of sea level rise, flooding coastal areas inhabited today by hundreds of millions, the study said.

""Unstoppable collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most concerning global tipping points,"" said Abram.

""The evidence points to this being triggered at global warming well below 2C.""

Another potential risk is the collapse of the Antarctic Overturning Circulation, a system of ocean currents that distribute heat and nutrients within the the region and globally.

A ""rapid and substantial slowdown"" of the currents has already begun, and evidence from the previous interglacial period -- between two ice ages -- before our own, 125,000 years ago, points to an abrupt stagnation of the system under conditions similar to those seen today.

""This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts,"" ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, the study reported.

Ultimately, the only way to slow down the interlocking changes is to stop adding more planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.

""The greenhouse gas emission decisions that we make over the coming decade or two will lock in how much ice we will lose and how quickly it will be lost,"" Abram said.

The electric Macan is not mechanically related to the gas-burning car and is quite a bit more expensive.

It's not perfect, but it's a great overall package that shows Porsche has learned a lot from building the Taycan.

You see a lot of Porsche Macans around the world, driven by people with expensive sunglasses and designer handbags. It is the cheapest way to enter the Porsche universe, and it blends excellent road manners with style and practicality, making it a global favorite.

But now that the combustion engine Macan is being phased out and replaced by a considerably more expensive pure electric model, does it have what it takes to maintain its popularity? Both flavors of Macan are still on sale today, and so far this year, and it’s the electric model that has proven more popular, even despite going electric (and potentially alienating part of its buyer pool) and hiking the price.

Even though the electric Macan is proving successful, Porsche isn't taking any chances and has confirmed that it's working on a new midsize combustion crossover. It will arrive in 2028, and it won't be called Macan.

While the Macan EV is more expensive than the ICE model, it’s also a better, more grown-up vehicle. The two are not mechanically related and the electric model rides on the VW Group’s Premium Platform Electric (PPE), which also underpins a couple of Audis. Thanks to this platform, it has a big 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack and offers big luxury car features such as rear-wheel steering.

This isn’t the first time we’ve tried the Macan, but now InsideEVs Editor-in-Chief Patrick George has spent more time with the car and had mostly positive things to say about it. His tester was a Macan 4 with a dual-motor powertrain providing 402 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. That’s enough to send the Macan EV to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds and up to a top speed of 137 mph.

The Macan 4 has an EPA range rating of 308 miles, but that goes down to around if you get the larger RS spider-design 22-inch wheels like the ones on Patrick’s tester. Interestingly, when Out of Spec Reviews drove a Macan Turbo at 70 mph, it actually exceeded its 288-mile EPA claim by 2 miles on 22-inch wheels. Tom Moloughney got 343 miles in the base rear-wheel-drive Macan on 20-inch aero wheels, surpassing its 315-mile EPA range prediction by almost 10%.

With a starting price of $81,600, the all-wheel-drive Macan 4 is definitely expensive. Patrick’s tester had some options, so it cost $94,855, which is a lot for a Macan, no matter what powers it. Patrick missed one-pedal driving, which the Macan doesn’t really offer, and it could also do with a bit more drama when you’re going fast in one. But overall it works really well, it’s practical, it’s well built and it’s just a cohesive package. It really shows Porsche has gained experience making EVs, and in many areas, it feels like an improvement over the Taycan.

It also does not produce any planet-warming pollution, which is the cause of rapidly rising global temperatures — another factor in rising energy demand, as they are increasing air conditioning use across the globe.

What's being done about clean energy upgrades in the U.S.?
EnergySage noted that in less than three years, the Inflation Reduction Act induced $422 billion in private-sector clean energy investments and helped create over 400,000 jobs.","A U.S. Department of Energy report raised questions about the Trump administration's push to put the country's renewable energy transition on the back burner.

What's happening?

The July Resource Adequacy Report ""recycled familiar, but flawed, talking points against renewable energy, warranting a closer look at the facts behind the rhetoric,"" EnergySage reported. The administration props up fossil fuels as a solution to meet rising demand spurred by the massive growth of artificial intelligence and data centers, saying that retiring old dirty energy sources over the next five years will create a shortfall without investment in firm baseload generation sources.

But the independent clean energy platform noted that solar power is the cheapest and most scalable source of energy, as it can take less than a year to build and connect a solar farm. The cost is $38-$78 per megawatt-hour compared to $48-$107 for gas power. Even if it takes 18 months to build a renewable system with battery storage, which is rare, that's far quicker than the 5-7 years for new gas capacity or 10-15 years for a new nuclear power plant.

Even China, notoriously reliant on coal power, gets 33% of its electricity from renewables, according to EnergySage. The United States gets 22%.

""The actions to undercut and terminate investments in research and development of new technologies are incredibly devastating to the ability of the United States to invent, demonstrate, scale, and deploy clean energy technologies,"" former White House adviser Kristina Costa told EnergySage. ""The rest of the world is not changing their investment plans to move toward cleaner sources of electricity — they are continuing apace. The difference is that we are going to be artificially left behind.""

Why is this important?

Noting the potential of solar power in states such as California and Arizona, Ember global electricity analyst Kostantsa Rangelova said: ""It's a national risk for the U.S. to lose out on being part of that global story.""

Solar is not just cheap for distributors; it's one of the best ways for homeowners to save money on energy costs. It also does not produce any planet-warming pollution, which is the cause of rapidly rising global temperatures — another factor in rising energy demand, as they are increasing air conditioning use across the globe.

Explore EnergySage's free tools to get estimates on a solar installation and compare quotes. The average person can get nearly $10,000 in incentives to offset the upfront cost, which is the main barrier to entry for home solar systems. EnergySage also has a mapping tool that shows the average cost of a solar setup by state as well as details on incentives.

These incentives, however, will expire after Dec. 31 since Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To claim the 30% solar tax credit, homeowners should act fast.

""These actions show that the Trump administration is more focused on undoing the previous administration's legacy than prioritizing the country's long-term energy security and affordability,"" EnergySage stated. ""In doing so, they've created a dangerous situation for Americans by undermining some of the only electricity sources ready to meet rising demand today.""

What's being done about clean energy upgrades in the U.S.?

EnergySage noted that in less than three years, the Inflation Reduction Act induced $422 billion in private-sector clean energy investments and helped create over 400,000 jobs. But the Trump administration has taken ""the legs out from under that manufacturing renaissance,"" Costa said — contrary to its pledge to ""unleash"" the country's ""energy dominance.""

She added that customers, utilities, grid operators, and technical experts agree that the administration and its rhetoric do ""not have any resemblance to reality on the ground.""

""By stalling progress, the U.S. risks ceding its position as a global solar superpower to China — threatening not only its energy leadership, but also its economic competitiveness and national security in the decades ahead,"" EnergySage concluded.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oVuAYozZmZTaxJp2MCjoCw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/a1f6c1908cb39939ac807b59c6e5bbd0,N,,2025-08-23 23:59:32.503486

When the tax credit after September 30, Tesla will have to sell the Model Y, Model 3, or any of its vehicles on their own merit. For now, EV sales in the US are up year-on-year thanks to buyers rushing to take advantage of the tax credit.

EV tax credit expiration date

The IRS has now changed its rules to allow those who pay for their new electric car in the current quarter to receive the $7,500 in tax credit that more often than not ends up as a down payment on a Model Y lease.

Previously, Tesla clarified that the buyer must take delivery by the September 30 deadline to take advantage of the tax credit subsidy. The IRS, however, has changed the language in section 30D of the One Big Beautiful Bill that mandates the end of the new EV tax credit subsidy to reflect that buyers can profit from the tax credit even after September 30.

""The credit will not be allowed for any vehicle acquired after September 30, 2025"" reads the amended section, which in government parlance means that even a small Model Y down payment or a trade done before the end of the quarter will qualify the buyer for the tax credit. In order to then claim it, the dealer will have to provide a time-of-sale report to the IRS on delivery, and the buyer will get the $7,500 subsidy even if their Model Y drives itself to their garage after September 30.

California EV tax credit replacement

Even after the federal EV tax credit expiration, states like California may pick up the slack and replace the program with local incentives. In June, the Governor of California Gavin Newsom signed Executive Order N-27-25 that recommended moving to state-funded EV and clean energy subsidies, compensating for their loss at a federal level.

The order intends to keep the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and give EV buyers rebates, vouchers, or another form of purchasing incentive that matches the expiring federal tax credit. The executive order says that the state will fund purchases of new or second-hand electric cars, as well as fleet electrification and charging infrastructure deployment.

How exactly will Newsom's clean vehicle tax credit replacement mandate compensate for the $7,500 federal outlay remains to be seen, but California's move may be a harbinger of things to come as both individual states and automakers like Tesla are now starting to think how to sell electric cars without government subsidies.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/model-y-7-seat-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 17:02:41.795956

Former President Joe Biden’s “whole-of-government” embrace of climate action has turned into a wholesale attack on clean energy — with a growing number of agencies joining in.

Biden threaded his climate policy into the work of each government agency. And that kicked into higher gear after congressional Democrats opened federal coffers for clean energy developers through the Inflation Reduction Act.

Now, President Donald Trump is using the same overarching strategy to target the wind, solar and battery industries, making it the task of every agency to eliminate or redirect programs that benefit renewables.

“We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,” Trump wrote Wednesday on Truth Social. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”

New examples pop up almost daily.

The administration on Thursday used its formidable powers to investigate global trade practices to upend cost projections for wind projects — a source of electricity Trump has repeatedly denigrated as unreliable, a bird killer and an eyesore. The Commerce Department launched a formal probe into whether imports of wind turbines and their components harm national security, a first step toward imposing new tariffs that would raise costs and further shake up the industry, Christa Marshall reports.

Earlier in the week, the Agriculture Department took on solar energy projects on farmland by scaling back a pair of programs that helped farmers install solar panels on their land.

“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a Tuesday news release.

‘Climate religion’

And last month, the Transportation Department said it would formally recommend a 1.2-mile setback between wind turbines and any highway or railroad, citing potential obstruction of radio signals.

“Joe Biden and [former Transportation Secretary] Pete Buttigieg put climate religion ahead of safety — blatantly ignoring engineers who warned of the danger of constructing wind turbines near railroads and highways,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, took on battery storage this week, slamming Democrats who support batteries and releasing guidelines that warn of fires and health impacts.

The Energy and Interior departments are on the front lines of Trump’s energy policy. The “whole-of-government” effort aligns other members of the Cabinet with the agenda, which spans climate and energy programs across the sprawling federal bureaucracy.

But the administration’s drumbeat of opposition to renewable energy also taps into the frustration about the large footprints of most projects. Farms, for instance, have long been prime real estate for solar energy, often to the dismay of neighbors.

Long Island, home to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, is the site of a proposed 79-megawatt battery project that faces local opposition.

Zeldin, a former member of Congress and gubernatorial candidate, went there to announce EPA’s battery storage guidelines. He also took a few digs at his 2022 opponent, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.

When hurricanes and health care cuts collide

A Tennessee hospital damaged by Hurricane Helene last September is facing an uncertain future after Congress slashed over $1 trillion from health care programs and made it harder for people to get health insurance, Ariel Wittenberg writes.

Helene’s surging floodwaters forced people inside Unicoi County Hospital in northeastern Tennessee to evacuate by rooftop. The hospital offers one example of how rural hospitals are struggling financially as revenue sources stripped out by Congress face tightening budgets. Unicoi might not reopen, leaving the county without a hospital or emergency care.

“This is going to be a bloodbath if something isn’t changed,” said Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine, a Republican who led Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ health care transition team. “The issue isn’t just about Unicoi and whether it reopens, it will be about how many hospitals we can even keep open.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright extended an emergency order keeping a Michigan coal plant open Thursday, leaning on Trump’s policy to expand fossil fuel generation across the grid as it faces rising demand, Peter Behr writes.

“With electricity demand increasing, we must put an end to the dangerous energy subtraction policies embraced by politicians for too long,” Wright said.

In the order to keep the J.H. Campbell plant operating well past its intended closure, Wright on Thursday nodded to Trump’s antipathy toward renewable power. But electricity experts say Wright risks ignoring the full range of stresses the grid faces, issues that can’t be solved just by keeping old coal plants running.

Grids serving Texas and huge swaths of the middle of the country use significant amounts of renewable energy to keep the lights on, with utilities and big technology companies building or purchasing more. California has installed large amounts of energy storage to enable its supply of renewable power.

Not getting any cooler outside

The World Health Organization called on workplaces to create heat policies to protect workers from dangerous conditions, Rory O’Neill writes.

In a report and guidance on heat policies, the international organization noted workers are the largest group vulnerable to climate change. Nearly every sector is affected by extreme heat, with outdoor workers and first responders especially at risk.

After the hottest year on record in 2024, extreme heat is “for many, a case of adapt or die,” said Johan Stander of the World Meteorological Organization.

The idea is not just to protect the planet, but also to save a bit because keeping those plants running costs the state too much.
Every shutdown opens a door This isn’t just about shutting down power plants, it’s about making space for what’s coming.
It’s clean, efficient, and it’s already here.
And the United States wants, as always, to lead the clean energy revolution!","No one would have ever imagined it, but yes, it’s over. The United States has disconnected 12.3 gigawatts of energy capacity. Just like that. Plants that had been running for decades… And supplying a large part of the population. Some coal, some gas. Even some nuclear. All gone! And the thing is, this plant was key to keeping the country running… And now there’s no turning back. What is happening to our country? And above all… is there no turning back?

The Department of Energy and the EIA have been warning about it for a while, they want fewer emissions, less smoke, less noise. And more clean energy. The idea is not just to protect the planet, but also to save a bit because keeping those plants running costs the state too much.

Goodbye, coal, finally!

Yes, all of this comes because the EIA and the DOE want to move toward a more ecological vision, and coal isn’t exactly the best ally. We’ve been saying for years that this primary energy source is going to disappear… and it’s still here! And the thing is, we’ve been bombarded for decades with the transition to renewables but no one has done anything to gradually eliminate the use of coal… Until now. Now there really is no more, the numbers don’t add up. Environmental regulations are tightening, and climate change doesn’t give much room either.

What used to be seen as a symbol of progress is now a burden. No one wants to keep throwing money into plants that don’t perform when you see how renewable energies are evolving, so they’ve decided to say goodbye to these plants, and unfortunately it’s not just for ecology, but because they’re not profitable!

Are we running out of energy? Not at all

Let’s not exaggerate either, but removing 12.3 GW from the power system all at once will definitely be noticed, especially in places that used to rely on this power plant, but the energy doesn’t disappear, it will just start being generated from somewhere else and in another way.

Now there are many ways to produce clean energy, solar panels, wind turbines, modern batteries… Technologies that not so long ago seemed like something out of a movie. And now they’re here. States like California or Texas are already showing that it’s possible to live without coal and without missing the past!

Every shutdown opens a door

This isn’t just about shutting down power plants, it’s about making space for what’s coming. Engineering, research, investment… A new energy system that has nothing to do with burning coal. And that means building another one from scratch, quieter, cleaner, cheaper in the long term.

Some see it as a problem, but for us it’s an opportunity. We have to stop looking at the past to see that the future can start being better from the beginning!

What the U.S. does doesn’t stay in the U.S.

Even if this decision affects plants on U.S. soil, the message goes further. When a power like the United States makes such a clear decision, the rest of the world listens and has to take note.

This is not the end of anything. It’s the beginning

The shutdown of 12.3 GW marks the end of a stage, but every story that ends makes another begin, and that’s how it will be. What used to be a symbol of development is now just an old piece that was in the way, we have to make space for new generations, and the thing is, the energy of the future doesn’t smell like smoke, doesn’t make noise and doesn’t need excuses, just putting it into practice! It’s clean, efficient, and it’s already here.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Play on Energy Independence The DOE's extension for Lake Charles LNG is more than a bureaucratic adjustment—it's a strategic signal that the U.S. is doubling down on LNG as a pillar of its energy future.","The U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector is at a pivotal juncture, with regulatory decisions increasingly shaping its trajectory. The recent Department of Energy (DOE) extension for Energy Transfer's Lake Charles LNG project—pushing its completion deadline to December 31, 2031—highlights a broader trend: federal support for LNG infrastructure is accelerating the nation's energy independence while unlocking long-term value for investors. This move, coupled with market dynamics and geopolitical shifts, underscores why LNG is becoming a cornerstone of the U.S. energy strategy and a compelling investment opportunity.

Regulatory Tailwinds: A Catalyst for Growth

The Lake Charles LNG project, originally slated for completion in 2020, has faced delays due to the pandemic, evolving global demand, and ownership transitions. Yet, the DOE's latest extension reflects a deliberate policy shift to prioritize LNG exports. This aligns with the Trump administration's pro-energy agenda, which contrasts sharply with earlier regulatory hesitancy under the previous administration. By granting this extension, the DOE ensures the project remains authorized during construction, a critical factor for securing final investment decisions (FIDs) and long-term offtake agreements.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has similarly played a role, with prior extensions in 2019 and 2028. These regulatory actions signal a unified effort to streamline approvals for LNG projects, reducing bureaucratic friction that once stifled development. For investors, this clarity is invaluable. Projects like Lake Charles, with a projected capacity of 2.33 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), are now better positioned to capitalize on surging global demand, particularly in Asia and Europe, where energy security concerns are driving a shift away from Russian gas.

Market Dynamics: LNG as a Strategic Asset

The U.S. LNG market is poised for explosive growth. By 2035, the LNG bunkering market alone is projected to expand from $365.4 million in 2024 to $7.68 billion, driven by stricter environmental regulations and the adoption of LNG as a cleaner marine fuel. This growth is not speculative—it's being fueled by tangible infrastructure investments. For instance, TotalEnergies and Sempra Infrastructure are expanding their LNG bunkering capabilities, with TotalEnergies recently launching a terminal in Port Houston.

Investor sentiment is equally robust. The U.S. has become the world's largest LNG exporter, with projects in Louisiana and Texas accounting for 39.6% of global new export capacity under construction. This dominance is not accidental; it's the result of a regulatory environment that prioritizes energy production. The Lake Charles project, for example, has already secured long-term contracts with Chevron and Kyushu Electric, providing a stable revenue stream that enhances its investment appeal.

Case Studies: Regulatory Support Translates to Returns

Between 2020 and 2025, U.S. LNG projects have raised nearly $37 billion, with major FIDs secured for Louisiana LNG, CP2 LNG, and Cheniere's Corpus Christi expansion. These projects exemplify how regulatory clarity and market demand converge to generate returns. For instance, Venture Global's CP2 LNG project, which received FID in 2025, is projected to yield a 12% internal rate of return (IRR) over its 20-year lifespan, driven by long-term contracts with Asian buyers.

However, the regulatory landscape is not without risks. The DOE's 2024 pause on non-FTA export approvals initially caused uncertainty, but it also allowed for refined evaluation processes. This pause, while controversial, has not deterred investment—U.S. LNG developers raised $37 billion in 2025 alone, surpassing previous years. The key takeaway is that regulatory support, even when intermittent, creates a framework where projects can thrive once approvals are granted.

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors, the Lake Charles LNG extension and broader regulatory trends present a dual opportunity: energy security and financial returns. The U.S. is leveraging LNG to reduce reliance on foreign oil and gas, a strategic imperative in an era of geopolitical volatility. At the same time, the sector's growth is underpinned by infrastructure development, competitive pricing, and contract flexibility. U.S. LNG's ability to redirect shipments—unlike fixed pipeline exports—makes it a preferred option for global buyers, enhancing its market resilience.

Investors should focus on companies with strong regulatory backing and diversified offtake agreements. Energy Transfer, which now owns Lake Charles LNG, and Cheniere Energy, with its Corpus Christi expansion, are prime examples. Additionally, infrastructure plays like Sempra Infrastructure, which is building new bunkering facilities, offer exposure to the sector's ancillary growth.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Play on Energy Independence

The DOE's extension for Lake Charles LNG is more than a bureaucratic adjustment—it's a strategic signal that the U.S. is doubling down on LNG as a pillar of its energy future. While regulatory pauses and environmental reviews introduce short-term volatility, the long-term outlook remains bullish. With global demand for cleaner energy surging and U.S. producers poised to fill supply gaps, LNG is not just a commodity—it's a geopolitical and economic lever. For investors, the message is clear: aligning with this sector offers a unique blend of strategic value and financial upside.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 16:03:24.334387

""The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!"" he wrote on his Truth Social site this week.

Scientists across the globe agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont ""will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind"" in a post on X. Both governors are Democrats.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Orsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

""This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind's project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it,"" Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the U.S. and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

During the early 2000s, the development of fracking, a technology for cracking shale rock layers thousands of feet underground to obtain natural gas and oil, led to a boom in low-cost oil and natural gas.
The cost of producing natural gas went down.” “A single drilling pad could produce dozens of different wells … As a result, it became less expensive and more environmentally protective to produce natural gas.
“The market forces have resulted in coal plants shutting down, and less investment in coal,” he said.
One of those executive orders, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” invoked emergency powers to fast-track environmental reviews for coal-related projects.","The administration considers coal essential for meeting today’s surging energy demand. But despite all of these efforts, the industry has spiraled downward for decades, and some analysts say that the Trump team’s efforts will not be sufficient to reverse that trend.

Market realities facing coal

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in April that U.S. coal production has declined over the past two decades. The United States in 2023 produced 578 million short tons of coal, less than half of the amount produced in 2008, when U.S. coal production peaked.

The decline is partly attributable to the imposition of environmental regulations. Most prominently, the Environmental Protection Agency under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden sought to impose rules to limit carbon and toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants. Republican opponents accused the Democrats of waging a “war on coal” and said that the restrictions would mean the shuttering of plants around the country.

The rules have been subject to a regulatory and legal tug-of-war. Obama’s rule on power plant emissions was stayed by the Supreme Court. The first Trump administration proposed a rule with dramatically lighter restrictions, but the D.C. Circuit Court found it illegal just before Biden entered office.

The Supreme Court limited the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions in West Virginia v. EPA during the Biden administration, which later finalized a new rule to comply with the high court’s ruling that would have required coal plants to use carbon capture technologies to reduce their emissions by 90% by 2032.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, said, “The EPA regulations certainly under the Biden administration — they were really designed to shut down every coal plant in the United States.”

Now, the Trump EPA is taking action to repeal the rule.

Still, the regulatory actions against coal are only part of the story of its decline.

Scott Segal, cochairman of the Policy Resolution Group at Bracewell, told the Washington Examiner that economic factors have primarily driven the trend away from coal, noting that many of the toughest climate regulations were not fully implemented.

During the early 2000s, the development of fracking, a technology for cracking shale rock layers thousands of feet underground to obtain natural gas and oil, led to a boom in low-cost oil and natural gas. The Shale Revolution quickly made natural gas more competitive than coal.

“It’s not environmental law, but it’s more economic law,” Segal said. “The supply of natural gas went up. The cost of producing natural gas went down.”

“A single drilling pad could produce dozens of different wells … As a result, it became less expensive and more environmentally protective to produce natural gas. And those were market forces. Those were not forced by environmental regulation,” he added.

In July, EIA reported a price of $25.45 per megawatt-hour for natural gas at the Henry Hub in May 2025, while the cost of coal was $36.43 per megawatt-hour during the same period. Coal generated about 16.2% of U.S. electricity in 2023. Natural gas, in comparison, generated 43.1%, making it the single-largest source of power.

Brandon Dalling, an attorney at King & Spalding, said power producers will not spend capital to upgrade coal-fired plants unless they are guaranteed a long-term return on capital.

“In order to burn [coal], you need to keep spending a lot of money on your power plants to make sure that they are in tip-top shape to continue to burn coal, and that investment has not been as intensive in recent years,” he said.

Dalling said people have been more rewarded for investing in wind turbines, solar panels, battery storage, and gas-fired power plants.

“The market forces have resulted in coal plants shutting down, and less investment in coal,” he said.

Efforts to revamp coal

In April, Trump signed four executive orders aimed at revitalizing the coal industry. One of those executive orders, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” invoked emergency powers to fast-track environmental reviews for coal-related projects. It also opened up public land for coal leasing and directed the Interior Department to designate coal as a “mineral,” allowing it to receive similar federal benefits as other minerals, including eased permitting and federal loans.

The other orders directed the Energy Department to identify and keep critical power generation online to address grid reliability troubles, such as coal. One exempted power plants from complying with the EPA mercury and toxics standards for two years. Lastly, the president directed the Justice Department to challenge state laws that targeted the use of coal.

The Energy Department has recently used emergency powers to keep the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan and the Eddystone oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania from retiring, citing concerns of being unable to meet energy demands within the region. The Department of the Interior has also taken policy action to make coal more accessible by reducing regulatory barriers and reopening federal lands.

“The administration does not appear to be attempting to change the fundamental economics of the power system through these executive orders. These executive orders still cast a weather eye on emergency conditions and seek to address those emergency conditions,” Segal said.

In Congress, the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act classified metallurgical coal, used in steel production, as a critical mineral, making it eligible for an advanced manufacturing production credit. The legislation also speeds up the review of coal lease applications and increases federal land leasing for coal.

Surging energy demand

Those in the industry argue that coal is needed to meet growing energy demand, which is increasing due to the rise of technologies such as databases and artificial intelligence.

Emily Arthun, CEO of the American Coal Council, told the Washington Examiner, “There has been a constant assault on the coal industry for several decades at this point, and I believe that policies have to be put in place to help this industry revive.”

“We have areas like in California that experience rolling brownouts and blackouts due to lack of resources for energy. And so it’s absolutely critical that we have this very important baseload energy source continuing to thrive in the United States just to meet our energy needs,” she said.

The DOE released a report in July that found that the U.S. will see peak hour energy supply demand rise by at least 100 gigawatts by 2030, with half of the demand attributed to data centers.

As energy demand grows, prices are also going up. Electricity prices increased by 5.5% for the year ending in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index.

“We have been saying for the past three or four years that we are in the middle of an energy emergency,” Bloodworth said.

“We do feel like coal provides attributes that no other resource can replicate,” she continued. “One of those would be fuel security, 24/7 capacity, and it also can ramp up and down very quickly, especially during periods of extreme weather.”

In his first term, Trump attempted to revive the industry, including through proposals to boost payments to coal plants on the grounds that they produce reliable power, but failed to make any lasting changes.

This time, though, the White House created the Energy Dominance Council, led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, to coordinate among federal agencies on energy-related issues.

Bloodworth said the Trump administration’s creation of the council has made a “huge difference, even since the first Trump administration.”

Meanwhile, Ethan Tsai, project manager consultant at Rystad Energy, told the Washington Examiner he does not expect tremendous growth in the coal industry, but a decline in the retirement of coal plants.

“The truth of the matter is that coal’s still going to be around for at least another few decades. But the growth is not there. We’re going to be seeing a downward trend of coal within the grid space itself,” Tsai said.

CALIFORNIA GOP LAWMAKERS SUE AND STALL TO BLOCK NEW MAP FROM PASSING

The EIA told the Washington Examiner that 19.6 gigawatts of coal capacity were scheduled to retire by the end of 2024. As of the end of June, 105 gigawatts are still on track to retire within the same time frame, although nearly 8 gigawatts have had retirement schedule changes.

“As we’re seeing more and more natural gas power plants ramp up, more renewables ramp up, especially with AI and demand for data centers, and the spike in electricity demand, coal is going to take a smaller share of that entire supply,” Tsai added.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25098745996827.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 17:02:12.670125

The incident, while disruptive, offered a stark but instructive glimpse into how energy infrastructure must adapt to climate-driven volatility—and how crisis management strategies can shape investor perceptions in an era of escalating environmental risks.

Operational Resilience: From Emergency Response to Long-Term Adaptation

BP's immediate response to the flooding demonstrated a layered approach to risk mitigation. The refinery's emergency protocols included controlled shutdowns of processing units, emergency flaring to relieve pressure, and the deployment of containment booms to prevent water contamination. Specialized equipment was used to remove water from critical zones, while wastewater management systems—retention ponds, containment berms, and stormwater diversion—prevented discharges into natural waterways. These actions, combined with 24/7 coordination with regulators and local authorities, minimized environmental harm and ensured operational safety.

The refinery's phased restart, prioritizing system stability, underscored BP's commitment to operational continuity. By resuming full capacity within a week, the company mitigated regional fuel supply disruptions and stabilized markets. However, the incident also exposed vulnerabilities. The Whiting Refinery had already faced a six-month shutdown in 2024 due to a hydrogen leak and has incurred regulatory penalties in recent years. These recurring challenges have eroded refining margins and raised questions about the long-term viability of aging infrastructure in a climate of increasing extreme weather events.

Environmental Safeguards and Investor Sentiment

BP's environmental safeguards during the crisis were critical in managing reputational and regulatory risks. Air quality monitoring during flaring ensured emissions remained below harmful thresholds, while transparent communication with the public reinforced trust. Yet, these efforts were not enough to fully restore investor confidence.

BP's shares, trading at 419.5 GBX in August 2025, remained 70% below their estimated intrinsic value of 1,381.44 GBX, reflecting broader concerns about refining reliability and ESG performance. The company's underlying replacement cost (RC) profits had declined by 36% in 2024, and ESG downgrades from MSCI and Sustainalytics had increased financing costs. While BP's refining availability reached 96.4% in Q2 2025, the Whiting incident highlighted the fragility of its refining segment, particularly as diesel and jet fuel inventories remain low, squeezing margins.

Strategic Investments in Climate Resilience

BP's response to the 2025 crisis also revealed its long-term adaptation strategy. The refinery has invested in elevated electrical equipment, reinforced containment areas, and advanced weather monitoring systems with predictive modeling. These measures align with industry trends to harden infrastructure against climate risks. Additionally, BP's transformation of the Gelsenkirchen refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel signals a pivot toward the energy transition, though such projects require sustained capital and operational discipline.

For investors, the key question is whether these investments will offset recurring operational risks. While BP has cut structural costs by $1.7 billion since 2023, its refining segment remains under pressure. shows BP trailing its peers, amplifying concerns about its ability to compete in a decarbonizing energy landscape.

Investment Implications and the Path Forward

The Whiting Refinery incident underscores a critical truth: in the energy transition era, resilience is not just about avoiding disasters but about demonstrating the capacity to recover swiftly and sustainably. For BP, this means balancing short-term operational reliability with long-term decarbonization goals.

Investors should monitor two key metrics:

1. Refining Availability Trends: Sustained improvements in uptime will signal progress in addressing infrastructure vulnerabilities.

2. Energy Transition Execution: Success in projects like Gelsenkirchen's sustainable aviation fuel conversion will determine BP's ability to align with net-zero targets.

While BP's stock appears undervalued relative to intrinsic value models, its path to recovery hinges on credible climate resilience and ESG improvements. For risk-tolerant investors, the company's strategic investments in infrastructure hardening and low-carbon technologies could offer long-term upside. However, those prioritizing stability may prefer peers with stronger refining margins and ESG ratings.

In the end, the Whiting Refinery's story is a microcosm of the energy sector's broader challenge: navigating the dual pressures of climate adaptation and decarbonization. For BP, the next phase of its journey will test whether its crisis management strategies can evolve into a blueprint for sustainable resilience.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 19:04:01.017200

The Jefferson City Council recently postponed a public hearing for a bill approving a Chapter 353 redevelopment agreement to the owners of 208 Marshall St. City attorney Ryan Moehlman said the delay is due to additional paperwork needing to go out to the taxing districts.

The public hearing will now be Sept. 2 during the City Council meeting, which starts at 6 p.m. at City Hall.

The owners of 208 Marshall St., D.J. Drury and Chad Stockman, intend on redeveloping the building to lease as apartments.

Chapter 353 provides tax benefits for redevelopment in ""blighted areas"" or areas that are unsafe, unsanitary and/or deteriorating.

The program would provide Drury and Stockman a 75-percent tax abatement for the first 15 years and a 50-percent tax abatement for the following five years.

The property yields about $355 in annual tax revenue and the city's law department estimates the tax revenue from 20 years without development would generate $8,600 in tax revenue. With development and the tax abatement, the city estimates the property would generate $689,800 in tax revenue. With development but without the tax abatement, the city estimates the property would generate $250,400 in tax revenue.

The owners had Bandre, Hunt, Snider, LLC conduct a blight study, which determined that the Marshall Street building meets the requirements due to a collapsed roof and ceilings, moisture on the walls and floors, rusty and destroyed plumbing and broken windows.

The Marshall Street building, an art-deco style structure, was known as the ""Prince Edward Apartments"" when it was built in the 1930s. The apartment building is part of the Capitol Avenue Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Properties.

The owners hope to complete renovation by December or January and have tenants inside almost immediately, according to Drury.

The apartment will have 25 total units -- 15 one-bedroom apartments, seven two-bedroom apartments, two studio apartments and one rooftop penthouse unit.

Drury said rent will be between $850 and $1,850 a month. Amenities will include a furnished courtyard deck, a washer and dryer in each unit, 11 private storage units and on-site bicycle and electric scooter parking.

The City Council also just approved a real-estate agreement with Drury for 528 E. Capitol Ave., where he plans on building a duplex and adding a parking lot to accommodate 208 Marshall St. There is also off-street parking available on Marshall Street.

Drury said this apartment building will be great for Jefferson City's downtown scene, as he said the historic apartment buildings keep the ""urban-style living"" that people want when they live downtown.

The inside of the 208 Marshall St. apartments will be entirely new, Drury said, since he had to gut the interior due to years of water damage. He said he's spoken to people who are excited about having more options for living in downtown Jefferson City, especially people who walk to work.

""I've already talked to seven or eight people that work downtown that don't have vehicles and are like, 'Hey, well, count me in,'"" Drury said.

But before anybody can move in, Drury said he and the rest of the development team still have to set up utilities, which he said was ""the most daunting task at the moment."" He said he's eager to provide more housing in Jefferson City and watch the town grow during the next few years.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/23/210878608_IMG_0763_cropped_t1200.jpeg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-23 17:02:09.053047

It's encouraging to see more EV charging infrastructure coming to communities nationwide. That trend can help quell drivers' range anxiety while offering a convenient service.

Unfortunately, there are many drivers who seemingly want to make a point of expressing their anti-EV sentiments. There are far too many disturbing stories of EV charging cords being stolen and spots being deliberately blocked.

These stunts collectively can discourage drivers who are weighing the switch to an EV. Driving an EV comes with major benefits like fuel and maintenance savings as well as reducing contributions to air pollution.

Danish wind farm developer Orsted says the Revolution Wind project is about 80% complete, with 45 out of its 65 turbines already installed.

Despite that progress — and the fact that the project had cleared years of federal and state reviews — the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the order Friday, saying the federal government needs to review the project and “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

It did not specify what the national security concerns are.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site this week.

Scientists across the globe agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind” in a post on X. Both governors are Democrats.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Orsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the U.S. and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

“Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power. That is not enough to meet America’s rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies,” said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a group that supports offshore oil, gas and wind.

Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes the offshore wind industry, applauded the BOEM’s decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the nonprofit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the White House has halted. Work was stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,"" said Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

Continue to share your perspectives on these worrisome efforts to dismantle established science and policy progress in the EPA open comment period.","Two weeks ago — in my August 9 column — I shared Trump Administration plans for “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.” Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposal on July 29.

Zeldin shared plans to revoke the landmark 2009 “endangerment finding” that authorizes the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources like power plants, cars and trucks. It has effectively directed the EPA to address planet-warming fossil fuel burning over the past 15+ years in the U.S. Several conservative think tanks and industry groups like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers have opposed it over time. Yet, the “endangerment finding” was a 2007 Supreme Court decision that the EPA has responsibility to set emissions limits and standards on air pollution — including GHGs. Of note, the 2007 decision was a 5-4 ruling, and one of the dissenting justices was Chief Justice John Roberts.

Two weeks ago, I shared this link to an open public comment period where you can submit your views. The comment period has been extended to September 22.

On the same day as the Zeldin EPA proposal release, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright published a taxpayer-funded report called “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.” This DOE report called into question several key climate science topics that have been settled, and cast uncertainty on a range of other well-researched issues about our understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change. In the weeks since that release, there has been significant renunciation from many across the climate science and policy community. Statements from well-respected scholars, researchers and practitioners have pointed out that this report was rushed past an important process of peer review (where experts in relevant research areas evaluate the quality, validity and originality of a peer’s research before it may be published). Many have also noted that findings were rushed, lacked rigor and were “cherry-picked” so that evidence was presented out of context. The DOE report also poorly represented consensus views established across the scientific community and was laden with misdirection.

What is also troubling is that the DOE report feeds misperceptions about established scientific evidence. In other words, the report can deliberately give casual news consumers an impression that there is equivalence between climate research findings from reputable peer-reviewed processes conducted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and U.S. National Climate Assessment (which involves thousands of experts) and the findings of these five co-authors and members of the Trump Administration. This is false equivalency.

In the first Trump administration, in 2017, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt proposed to form an adversarial “red team” to debate and debunk established climate science (seen as a “blue team” perspective). Under the guise of “reform,” this initiative was supported by several right-wing think tanks like the Heritage Foundation (also authors of Project 2025) and the Heartland Institute. The effort sought to elevate outlier views in the public arena and policy decision-making spaces.

Red-team/blue-team approaches have been drawn from the military, where one group (a red team) seeks to challenge another group (a blue team) by posing antagonistic or contrarian arguments. It was seen in military contexts as a useful process to rethink strategies and approaches to complex problems. Yet, its application in this scientific space is problematic.

Among logical pushback over time, the dubious 2017 Pruitt pursuit prompted a lawsuit by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) (and the Southern Environmental Law Center). The red team/blue team plans lost momentum when Pruitt resigned in 2018. Now, we can see these ideas revived in an amped up form in this 2025 offensive.

This 2025 Trump Administration, DOE and EPA effort has now propelled EDF (and Union of Concerned Scientists) to file an August 12 lawsuit against Zeldin, Wright, the EPA and DOE for the unlawfully non-transparent and secret formation of the DOE author group as well as their effort to use their misguided assessment to overturn the endangerment finding.

And by Energy Sage! Time’s running out in the U.S. to get the benefit of federal tax incentives, so plan your energy independence today!

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!

New EV sales figures for the month of July around the world have finally been tabulated, and for those who claim EV sales are falling, I am happy to report they are wrong.

Global research firm Rho Motion reported this week that one point six million electric vehicles were sold in July, up twenty-one percent year over year. That brings total sales for the year so far to ten point seven million, a twenty-seven percent increase year over year. In China, sales are up forty percent year over year, while Europe has seen a thirty percent increase year to date. That said, some countries, such as France, did see a decline. In the United States, growth was far more modest, with just a two percent increase year to date. However, President Trump’s ending of federal electric vehicle tax incentives in just over a month has prompted a surge in demand. Many buyers are rushing to purchase before the credits expire. You could call it a Trump Bump.

As automakers look to shift production around the world to maximize profits and avoid unnecessary tariffs, Kia has celebrated the start of local production of the EV4 in Slovakia for the European market.

The recently modernized facility in Zilina, Slovakia — known as Kia Autoland Slovakia — has been producing European-market internal combustion engine models for more than twenty years. However, this is the first time the facility has produced an electric vehicle. For now, only the five-door hatchback variant of the EV4 will be built at the facility. The four-door sedan — or saloon, if you prefer — will still be imported from South Korea. In addition to saving on shipping costs, domestic production allows Kia to respond more quickly to demand in Europe, which, as our previous story shows, has risen thirty percent year over year.

As Volkswagen celebrated the production of its one and a half millionth electric ID vehicle — which happened to be an all-black ID.7 Tourer Pro — the automaker has secured the deal it needs to produce its most affordable EV yet.

As reported toward the end of the week, Volkswagen has officially signed an agreement with Portugal to make its Palmela facility home to both the new ID.1, the subcompact electric vehicle due to launch in late twenty twenty-seven, and the facelifted T-ROC. The deal was signed at an official groundbreaking ceremony marking construction of a new paint shop at the site. While neither the government nor Volkswagen officially confirmed the value of the subsidies in the deal, the local newspaper Observador, citing sources close to both parties, reports that up to thirty million euros have been earmarked.

Ford and its battery partner SK On celebrated the start of official NCM battery cell production at the newly completed BlueOval SK facility in Glendale, Kentucky, United States.

The first cells to roll off the line are headed to Ford’s historic Rouge Electric Vehicle production facility in Detroit for the F150 Lightning. Additional cells will be used in other models, including the Ford E-Transit, bringing Ford closer to an all-domestic battery supply chain. BlueOval SK’s CEO confirmed to The Detroit News that production at its Tennessee facility has been delayed until twenty twenty-seven. The company, which operates independently of Ford, is also seeking new customers amid uncertainty in the United States about the future of electric vehicles under an EV-hostile government. The more contracts it secures, the more cells it can produce, the lower the cost per cell becomes, and the more sustainable and robust its business will be.

Sticking with batteries, Porsche has hit the news this week with what at first appear to be conflicting stories.

Der Spiegel reports that Porsche executives are considering an almost total shutdown of its battery subsidiary, Cellforce, keeping only a skeleton staff for research and development. The company declined to confirm or deny the report. At the same time, Porsche’s investment arm participated in a Series-D funding round worth four hundred and sixty-three million U.S. dollars for battery specialist Group14, which focuses on advanced silicon-based active cell materials. Its subsidiary V4Smart also launched second-generation lithium-ion cylindrical cells in two formats — one for high-power delivery and one for balanced energy-to-power delivery. Taken together, it appears Porsche is not ending its battery efforts, but shifting priorities to what it considers the latest, most promising technologies.

European policies designed to slow imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles — or at least even the playing field between Chinese companies and domestic brands — might be backfiring.

A new Dataforce analysis suggests automakers like BYD and MG, both of which plan to bring EV production to Europe and thus avoid tariffs, are using a stopgap measure. They are increasing their imports of plug-in hybrids until their European plants are online. Current rules do not affect plug-in hybrids in the same way as electric vehicles, meaning plug-in hybrids can, in some cases, be imported more cheaply than fully electric models. While the original tariffs were meant to affect only Chinese-made, Chinese-branded vehicles, many European manufacturers — including BMW and Volkswagen-owned Cupra — are also affected, as some of their EV models are made in China. Multiple lawsuits have already been filed against the European Union.

If you have an air quality meter — like an Air Gradient — you might notice a drop in air quality when certain electrical appliances are on, due to static electricity, heat, and poor ventilation concentrating fine particles.

A team of researchers at UCLA, California, has found the same effect around DC fast chargers. At forty-seven sites monitored in Los Angeles County, PM 2.5 reached thirty-nine micrograms per cubic meter, or an AQI of about one hundred and ten — well above typical urban background levels. Of course, fast chargers do not generate PM 2.5 directly; instead, poor cooling and design can recirculate dust and fine particles that would otherwise settle. Long term, the research team says that a few tweaks to cabinet designs could dramatically reduce localized PM 2.5 concentrations. But for now, anyone with respiratory conditions might want to avoid standing directly next to a charger for prolonged periods while it is in use.

Electric vertical takeoff and landing company Archer Aviation has just completed its longest piloted flight yet of its Midnight aircraft, covering approximately fifty-five miles (eighty-eight kilometers) in just over half an hour.

While the company cites the distance as “approximately” — which is amusing given modern instruments — it says the flight reached a top speed of over one hundred and twenty-six miles per hour (two hundred and two kilometers per hour). The week prior, test flights reportedly exceeded one hundred and fifty miles per hour (two hundred and forty-one kilometers per hour) across a variety of flight patterns. Although Archer’s press release feels intentionally vague, it is worth noting that the company currently has an ongoing test program with the U.S. Air Force and is working to obtain both FAA certification in the United States and airworthiness approval for commercial operations in the United Arab Emirates, where a significant portion of its funding comes from.

Ahead of its production launch this autumn, Nissan has confirmed that its twenty twenty-six LEAF will go on sale in the United States with a starting price under thirty thousand U.S. dollars.

The LEAF, now in its fifteenth year, will launch in three trim levels and moves away from its previous hatchback style for an all-new crossover feel. Built on the same platform as the Ariya, it will come with a fifty-two or seventy-five kilowatt-hour battery pack. While a lower-cost S- trim will eventually be available, Nissan says the S+ will be the cheapest at launch, with the larger battery and an estimated EPA range of three hundred and three miles (four hundred and eighty-seven kilometers) per charge. At twenty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety U.S. dollars, it is the lowest MSRP of any new electric vehicle in the United States. That price excludes the soon-to-end federal tax credits, though state incentives may reduce the cost further. With an even cheaper model possibly coming later, this is very good news for fans of more affordable electric vehicles.

And finally, a quick update from U.S. political land — if you don’t want to hear about the resident Nazi in Chief, feel free to skip this section. It’s okay. I’ll wait… Still here? Strap in.

This week, in addition to trying to erase museum exhibits about slavery, deploying more armed troops to the Capitol, encouraging ethnic cleansing in Gaza, attempting to remove voting rights from millions of Americans, and trying again to ban trans healthcare — oh, and threatening the legal status of more than fifty-five million legal U.S. visa holders — President Tiny Pee Pee has instructed the Department of the Interior to deny all future solar and wind projects in the country, both on- and offshore. At this point, it seems to mostly affect grid-scale projects, but who knows? And if you’re about to rant in the comments that I’m being political — tough, we’re past quiet compliance. I am deeply sorry to the rest of the world for how hateful and selfish the Republican Party has been. They even painted over a sidewalk monument in Florida to the victims of the Pulse Night Club massacre… at night… so nobody would notice. I… am so angry. State-sponsored hate and disinformation is not — and has never been — okay.

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Energy Sage connects you with local, verified solar installers across the United States — and now heat pump specialists in select markets — who really know their stuff and can help guide you through installing solar panels or getting a heat pump. Not a homeowner? No worries. Energy Sage can still help you green your electricity by joining a community solar program!

We used Energy Sage ourselves when looking for installers willing to put solar panels on our roof, and their verified pros were knowledgeable and even introduced us to a great credit union to finance the project with low monthly payments.

As I’m sure many of you know, HR1 is now U.S. law, and all incentives for solar — including savings of as much as thirty percent through the federal tax credit — will disappear soon. Solar projects take time, so if you want to lock in these savings, it’s important to act now because… time is running out.

Follow the links below to sign up for Energy Sage’s free, no-obligation service and get started today! And if you choose an Energy Sage installer, we’ll receive a small referral fee — so you’ll be helping us too! Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support our show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

If you’ve been watching the news for the past few weeks, you’ll know that the U.S. Federal Government is working hard to try and eliminate the EPA’s Endangerment Finding, a key two thousand and nine finding that air pollution is damaging to human health.

The pretzel-like loops the Enriching Polluters Association have been tying themselves in to try and argue that protecting the environment and human health is not the primary concern of the EPA has been frustrating at best and enraging at worst, and as we’ve pointed out, there’s a public consultation period on the proposed rule changes. And this week marked four days of public hearing into the proposed rule changes, where supporters and opponents to the proposal got to speak. Sadly, we’re filming this before the third and fourth days of testimony are heard, but as of the time of writing this, three hundred and sixty-four people spoke in opposition to the elimination of the Endangerment Finding, while only eight spoke in support of it. I don’t think this will ultimately sway the EPA’s decision. After all, that’s not how the Federal Government under President Trump works, but it shows that there is at least some hope… as long as we all keep fighting for what’s right.

And finally…

The caped crusader has been around for more than eighty-six years, and the story of Gotham’s wealthy playboy superhero — along with his various sidekicks — has been told in countless different ways.

And of course, as Batman has evolved, so has his preferred method of transportation. From comics to the small and big screen, we’ve seen many different takes on the Batmobile — and sometimes even a motorcycle or two. Over the years there have also been plenty of tie-ins, often from high-end luxury marques. But this week, Indian automaker Mahindra unveiled something a little different: its own official, Warner Brothers-approved Batmobile — the Mahindra BE.6 Batsman Edition. It’s the company’s, and the world’s, first Batman-inspired SUV, and can be yours from just twenty-seven point seven-nine lakh rupees. Only three hundred examples will be made, with deliveries beginning on September twentieth — which also happens to be International Batman Day. So if you’re in India, or have Bruce Wayne-levels of money to ship one overseas, you could roll up to the lights, lower your window, and announce… “I’m Batman.”

And on that vocal cord-destroying note, we’re done for today!

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we’d really appreciate it. Youtube, in its ultimate wisdom, is now inserting so many ads into long-form content that it’s pushing people off the platform – and it’s also diluting the money paid to creators for every ad. And because right now there’s not really a good alternative for those who don’t want to go to PeerTube (and no, Nebula is invite only, which is why we’re not on there), Patreon is really our only reliable form of income.

If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position. We are preparing a massive fundraising drive this autumn with special perks for those who sign up, so keep your eyes peeled if you’d like… more incentives to support us. While it’d be lovely to all have day jobs, this channel is a full time affair and our team does deserve normal things – like healthcare and a living wage.

I should also note we’re available for third-party video production work in the Portland Oregon area, if you have a business or project you’d like us to work with you on, reach out. Below, you’ll also find links to our swag store and our Amazon affiliate link.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

And in closing, some important message.

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what hateful sods try to claim.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

I have no words for the true horror of the current news cycle, especially if you’re in a minority group – and if you’ve needed to turn off the news or take a rest and step back from the outside world, please know that’s okay. It’s important to take care of yourself. So, when you’re feeling better, you can come back, stronger than before, to stand up for decency, community and justice. Don’t let the … you know what… win. Embrace your awesomeness, and let your light shine.

Finally, Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

Orsted, a Danish energy company developing the wind farm, received construction permits from the Biden administration in 2023.
The company also has power purchase agreements with Rhode Island and Connecticut, where state officials estimated the wind farm would power up to 350,000 homes upon completion next year.

In a stop-work order issued on Friday afternoon, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it is seeking to address national security concerns raised by the construction of Revolution Wind.

The brief letter, signed by BOEM’s acting director Matthew Giacona, did not specify what those security concerns are.

Orsted, a Danish energy company developing the wind farm, received construction permits from the Biden administration in 2023. The company also has power purchase agreements with Rhode Island and Connecticut, where state officials estimated the wind farm would power up to 350,000 homes upon completion next year.

The project was nearly 80 percent finished, according to Orsted, with 45 of its 65 turbines installed.

In a press release, Orsted said it would comply with the stop-work order while it evaluates options to resolve the matter, including legal action.

The order does not impact similarly sized offshore wind farms like Vineyard Wind and Empire Wind, which other developers are constructing in nearby federal waters. The Trump administration halted work on Empire Wind for a month this spring before allowing construction to continue.

Politicians at Rhode Island’s highest levels of government vowed to fight the Trump administration to get Revolution Wind back under construction. State officials said they are considering legal action as well.

Revolution Wind is central to Rhode Island’s plan for a complete transition to clean energy sources by 2033, which the state passed in 2021 through legislation known as the Act on Climate. Revolution Wind was projected to double Rhode Island’s supply of renewable energy when operating at full capacity, according to the state’s attorney general, Peter Neronha.

“Without Revolution Wind, our Act on Climate is dead in the water,” Neronha said. “With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate, the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre.”

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said the action puts hundreds of American jobs at risk. Orsted built a factory in Providence where it manufactures turbine foundations for several wind farms under development along the East Coast.

Orsted also hires from local construction unions to assemble turbines at a port facility in New London, Conn., and install them offshore about 15 miles south of Rhode Island’s coast.",https://newspack-thepublicsradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/01/Windfarm_115-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 16:01:55.950071

But more than two years later, neither the promised Ford Lightning-150 pickup trucks nor charging stations have materialized.
The federal grant would pay 80% of the cost of a Ford Lightning F-150, priced at $55,000 in 2023.
East Chicago was hoping to get 14 electric vehicles and the city of Hobart was in line to get 16 electric vehicles.
The grant process for the federal dollars went through the Indiana Department of Transportation before going to NIRPC, Vera said.","Porter officials were excited in May 2023 that the town was approved for a federal grant to fund six electric-powered pickup trucks and the construction of at least two public charging stations.

But more than two years later, neither the promised Ford Lightning-150 pickup trucks nor charging stations have materialized.

It became a running joke at Porter Town Council meetings when Public Works Director James Spanier would give an update about the delayed delivery of the trucks. Then, he stopped talking about it.

“I’m not one to throw stones, but it’s not a smooth process from what we were told and how it came down,” Spanier said.

The federal grant would pay 80% of the cost of a Ford Lightning F-150, priced at $55,000 in 2023. That means Porter would have paid $66,000 for a fleet of six new electric pickup trucks. The grant would also pay 80% of a charging station’s price, which then cost $50,000

The town of Porter is not alone, as other communities in Porter and Lake counties have yet to receive what was promised from the $4 million grant awarded in 2023. East Chicago was hoping to get 14 electric vehicles and the city of Hobart was in line to get 16 electric vehicles.

“We have not received any of them that we were awarded,” said Jalen Robinson, public works director for East Chicago. “We’re kind of at a standstill.”

“We have not received them yet. It has been a bit of a mess,” Hobart Mayor Josh Huddlestun said.

Adrian Vera, the chief of staff for Lake Station, said that it should be understood that this grant went through a more complicated process.

Drive Clean Indiana, a nonprofit that advocates finding better environmental options, was the agency that first encouraged communities in Porter and Lake counties to apply for the funding, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Vera said that Lake Station was the lead city to apply for the grant.

When asked why it takes so long, Carl Lisek, executive director of Drive Clean Indiana, replied: “Believe me, I ask that every day.”

Vera said that the grant process involved several players in the region. Some of the other communities involved were Portage, Hammond, Whiting, Schererville and Griffith.

The original source of the federal dollars coming to local communities was the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, said Charles Bradsky, transportation projects director for the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission, or NIRPC. Then-President Joe Biden signed the bill into law on Nov. 5, 2021, with one of the stated goals being to address climate change.

The grant process for the federal dollars went through the Indiana Department of Transportation before going to NIRPC, Vera said.

Robinson said that he’s heard the hold-up could be partially attributed to the state and regional agencies “going back and forth” on procedural issues involving the grant.

While the grant was made to Porter and Lake County communities in 2023, Bradsky said that people should understand the grant’s distribution wasn’t going to happen immediately.

As the transportation projects director, Bradsky said he manages scores of Federal Highway Administration projects in Northwest Indiana.

“I cannot put everything in year one,” Bradsky said.

The Ford Lighting-150 trucks also sometimes take months to deliver. Bradsky said the distribution of funds will be spread out through 2028.

Lake Station received three of its promised six Ford Lightning-150s just a few weeks ago, Vera said. Currently, Vera said the hope is Hobart could soon receive its first three electric pickup trucks.

When Porter received its grant share, the plan was for the six F-150 Lightnings to be distributed with three to the Public Works Department and one each for the fire, police and parks departments. The town was looking at the grant as a way to significantly save money for its vehicle needs.

The town of Porter strives to be conscientious about the environment, so the town officials were excited about the possibility of offering more charging stations for public use.

The potential locations for the charging stations included downtown and Hawthorne Park. The Indiana Dunes Visitors Center already has a charging station, but if the town got enough funding, there was the possibility of the charging station being expanded.

Spanier said he probably should have figured it would take time.

“It’s not surprising when you involve that many government agencies, especially the feds. They have all sorts of rules.”

Danish wind farm developer Orsted says the Revolution Wind project is about 80% complete, with 45 out of its 65 turbines already installed.

Despite that progress — and the fact that the project had cleared years of federal and state reviews — the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the order Friday, saying the federal government needs to review the project and “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

It did not specify what the national security concerns are.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site this week.

Scientists across the globe agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind” in a post on X. Both governors are Democrats.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Orsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the U.S. and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes the offshore wind industry, applauded the BOEM’s decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the nonprofit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the White House has halted. Work was stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,"" said Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

For investors, reconciling these dynamics is critical—especially for companies like Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH), which sits at the intersection of disruptive innovation and structural challenges.

Enphase's Financials: A Tale of Two Margins

Enphase's Q2 2025 results reveal a company navigating a fragile balance. Revenue rose to $363.2 million, driven by 11% growth in Europe and 3% in the U.S., with 1.53 million microinverters and 190.9 MWh of IQ Batteries shipped. Gross margins remained robust at 46.9% (GAAP) and 48.6% (non-GAAP), though the latter excludes a 11.4% boost from Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. This dependency raises questions about sustainability.

Non-GAAP operating income hit $98.6 million, translating to a trailing P/E of ~55x at a stock price of $38.17. While this high multiple reflects optimism about Enphase's leadership in residential solar and storage, it also highlights a disconnect with peers. The solar sector's average P/E is 30.1x, and Enphase's 44.3x EBITDA multiple dwarfs the peer median of 9.0x. This valuation dislocation stems from a 67.9% drop in EBITDA from 2023 to 2024, driven by elevated R&D (15.1%) and SG&A (25.4%) costs.

Sector-Wide Headwinds: Policy, Prices, and People

The solar industry's broader challenges amplify Enphase's risks. Price volatility persists despite IRA-driven optimism, with residential solar prices up 3% year-over-year. Soft costs—permits, labor, interconnection—remain stubbornly high in the U.S., eroding the benefits of falling hardware prices. Meanwhile, interconnection delays and labor shortages are slowing project timelines, particularly in the utility-scale segment.

Policy uncertainty looms large. While the IRA has boosted deployment forecasts by 67%, its future under a potential administration shift remains unclear. For Enphase, which relies on U.S. tax credits for its 45X production tax credits, this creates a double-edged sword: near-term tailwinds versus long-term exposure to regulatory risk.

Strategic Moves and Valuation Realism

Enphase's response to these challenges has been mixed. The company has repurchased $30 million in shares, reduced capital expenditures, and launched the IQ Battery 5P with higher domestic content to qualify for IRA benefits. Yet its ROIC of 4.4% in 2024—down from 19.8% in 2023—suggests underutilized assets and weak capital efficiency.

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model offers a more grounded view. With free cash flow of $18.4 million in Q2 and projections of $715 million by 2035, Enphase's intrinsic value is estimated at $45.96 per share, a 16.9% discount to its current price. This suggests the market is pricing in a recovery that may not materialize unless Enphase achieves its 2026 targets: $1.8–$2.0 billion in revenue and 20%+ EBITDA margins.

Is Enphase Undervalued? A Cautious Case

The answer hinges on two factors: execution risk and sector resilience. Enphase's high P/E and EBITDA multiples are justified only if it can:

1. Reduce costs through manufacturing consolidation and R&D efficiency.

2. Scale battery sales to offset declining microinverter margins.

3. Navigate policy shifts without losing IRA eligibility.

For now, the stock appears overvalued on earnings but undervalued on cash flow. Its DCF-based intrinsic value and strategic pivot toward storage offer a margin of safety, but the path to profitability is fraught. Investors must weigh Enphase's innovation in distributed energy resources against its operational inefficiencies and sector-wide headwinds.

Investment Advice: A Wait-and-See Approach

Enphase Energy is a high-conviction play for those who believe in the democratization of energy storage and the IRA's long-term impact. However, the current valuation reflects optimism that may not be warranted. A buy is justified only if the company:

- Delivers 20%+ EBITDA margins by 2026.

- Maintains its leadership in residential storage as competition intensifies.

- Avoids further margin erosion from rising component costs.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 16:02:24.692818

China’s CNAF to Invest in Private Chinese SAF Plant

(Reuters) China National Aviation Fuel Co. (CNAF) said on Aug. 18 it had agreed to acquire a stake in a sustainable aviation fuel plant controlled by private biofuel producer Henan Junheng Industry Group Biotech Co.

This marks CNAF’s second such investment in a privately controlled green jet fuel maker. CNAF is China’s dominant distributor of aviation fuel.

CNAF announced the signing of the investment agreement on its official WeChat platform but did not give any financial details.

Central China-based Junheng is one of China’s first commercial SAF refiners, processing used cooking oil (UCO) into the low-carbon fuel.

China is the world’s largest UCO producer.

Junheng is expanding its 400,000 tonnes-per-year SAF plant in the city of Puyang, Henan province, to reach 1 million tonnes per year around June 2026.

Last month, CNAF became a strategic investor in an east China-based SAF plant controlled by Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, by agreeing to acquire a 10% stake at about 261 million yuan (US$36.35 million), according to a Jiaao stock filing.

China, the world’s second-largest aviation fuel market, has yet to announce a national mandate for the use of SAF. It began a pilot scheme last September for the first use of SAF in a dozen flights departing from domestic airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengzhou and Ningbo. That was expanded in March to all domestic flights departing these airports.

Tech Providers Leap, Texture Form BESS Partnership

Platform technology providers Leap and Texture have formed a partnership that aims to help battery energy storage companies implement virtual power plants, according to an Aug. 21 news release.

Leap’s platform focuses on building and scaling VPPs with software, while Texture’s AI-native energy operations platform integrates with energy data sources to create a data cloud that powers workflows. By integrating their offerings, the duo gives storage companies access to customized VPP programming.

“The collaboration provides a turnkey solution that significantly reduces time to market by lowering technical and operational barriers to entry in grid services, such as time-consuming Measurement & Verification processes and data sharing challenges,” the release said.

Initial partners include solar developer Solridge, solar and battery installer Haven Energy and a major residential storage manufacturer, according to the news release.

US Defense Department to Buy Cobalt for up to $500MM

(Reuters) The U.S. is seeking to procure cobalt worth up to $500 million for defense stockpiles amid the country’s move to boost its critical mineral supplies.

Companies have been scrambling to source rare earths after China imposed restrictions, leading to a 75% drop in rare earth magnet exports from the country in June and causing some auto companies to suspend production.

U.S. President Donald Trump in March invoked emergency powers to boost domestic production of critical minerals as part of a broad effort to offset China’s near-total control of the sector.

According to the tender document published by the U.S. Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency on Aug. 20, they are looking for offers for alloy-grade cobalt of about 7,480 tonnes over the next five years.

Cobalt, mostly imported by the U.S., is used in batteries, a component in nickel superalloys for high temperature sections of jet engines and industrial gas turbines, among others.

However, the defense department was seeking offers from only three companies—units of Vale SA in Canada, Japan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining and Norway’s Glencore Nikkelverk. The document also said the purchase amount can range from between $2 million and $500 million in the five-year period.

Fluence Starts Production at New Facility in Houston

Fluence Energy on Aug. 21 said it has started producing thermal management systems for its battery energy storage systems at its new manufacturing facility in Houston.

The company said the facility, in partnership with Bergstrom, will play a role in its strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-scale battery energy storage system in the U.S. Systems produced at the Houston site include HVAC and chiller equipment, Fluence said in a news release.

“There’s broad recognition of the enormous value batteries bring to the electricity grid—to address increased power demand, maintain reliability, and lower costs,"" said John Zahurancik, president of Fluence Americas. “With this Houston facility and our broader network of U.S. manufacturing plants, U.S.-made battery energy storage is playing a growing role in domestic power production and energy security.”

Virginia-headquartered Fluence said it has more than 22,000 MWh of battery energy storage capacity deployed or contracted across more than 90 projects in the U.S.

Viridi Installs BESS at Denver Public Library

Viridi, in partnership with construction and energy services company McKinstry, on Aug. 20 said it has installed a fail-safe battery energy storage system at the Denver Public Library, calling it a first-of-a-kind solar and storage project.

The company said its behind-the-meter RPSLinkEX system captures excess solar energy for use during non-solar hours, while reducing peak demand and providing backup power during outages. The system is fully integrated into the library’s existing infrastructure and monitored through Viridi’s ViSTA Dashboard.

New York Awards Over $11MM for Hydrogen R&D Projects

Five hydrogen R&D projects are the recipients of more than $11 million doled out by New York as the state works to lower emissions in industrial processes.

Selected through the Advanced Fuels and Thermal Energy Research Program, the projects will “demonstrate new technology designs, cost reductions associated with clean hydrogen storage and distribution, evaluate large-scale clean hydrogen storage opportunities, and deploy zero-emission hydrogen-powered transportation,” the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority said Aug. 21 in a news release.

Stony Brook University was awarded more than $4.9 million for a low-pressure, ambient-temperature hydrogen storage system at Northwell Health Hospital.

National Grid Ventures was awarded $2 million to install the first commercially deployed, fully hydrogen-fueled linear generator at its Northport Power Plant in Fort Salonga.

Plug Power and partner Verne landed $2 million to co-develop new hydrogen distribution trailers with cryo-compressed storage technologies.

Switch Maritime was awarded $2 million to develop and demonstrate New York’s first hydrogen fuel cell-electric ferry.

GTI Energy was awarded more than $220,000 to study New York’s geological hydrogen storage potential for large-scale, long-duration energy storage.

“New York’s investments in clean hydrogen are helping to unlock this emerging resource as a potential contributor to the state’s affordable, abundant and reliable energy system,” said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. “Advancing alternative fuels like clean hydrogen will grow our clean energy economy while reducing emissions statewide.”

The projects were funded through New York’s $6 billion Clean Energy Fund.

Geronimo Starts Construction on 125-MW Solar Plant in Michigan

Construction has commenced for the 125-megawatt (MW) Jackson County solar project in Michigan, developer Geronimo Power (formerly National Grid Renewables) said Aug. 18.

The solar facility is expected to generate enough electricity to power an estimated 33,600 homes annually when it begins operations in 2026, the company said. It will be the latest in the Geronimo’s MiSolar Portfolio, which also includes the 20-MW Bingham Solar facility in Clinton County and the 20-MW Temperance Solar facility in Monroe County.

All three serve the Midwestern Independent System Operator (MISO) market. The solar facilities will lift Geronimo’s capacity in the MISO region to nearly 1 gigawatt, the company said.

Silicon Ranch to Build 100-MW Solar Farm Supporting Meta

Solar developer Silicon Ranch has partnered with Central Electric Power Cooperative to build a 100-MW solar farm to support Meta’s first data center in South Carolina, according to a news release Aug. 19.

Located in Orangeburg County, the solar farm will be Silicon and Central’s fourth project together and the 18th infrastructure project between Meta and Silicon, the solar developer said.

Working with system balancing authority Santee Cooper, Silicon said it will fund, own and operate the solar farm. Electricity produced will be purchased by Central to benefit its member cooperatives. The cooperatives, the release said, includes Aiken Electric, which serves the Meta facility being constructed near Graniteville, South Carolina.

Both the data center and the solar farm are expected to start operations in 2027, according to the release.

China’s Solar Industry Association Calls for End to Price Wars

(Reuters) China’s solar industry association on Aug. 22 called for solar manufacturers to stop selling components below cost and advocated for “survival of the fittest” market competition—but stopped short of calling for capacity closures to address oversupply in the industry.

In a statement following multi-day consultations with the solar industry and a raft of government stakeholders, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association said in a statement on its WeChat account that companies should schedule their production on the basis of market supply and demand and strictly adhere to China’s price law—a nod to the prevailing practices of expanding production to try to maintain market share while undercutting competitors, leading to surging overcapacity.

The statement also called on solar companies to maintain safety and quality standards and abide by intellectual property rules and asked power-generating firms to reduce the weighting that they give to component prices in the bidding process.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Shot sets a clear target: cut the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram How Solar and Hydrogen Work Together Solar panels make electricity when the sun shines.
Hydrogen Shot (DOE) Targets clean hydrogen at $1/kg within a decade.
Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (DOE) Up to $7 billion to build seven hubs for production, delivery, and use.
Costs and Technology Trends Today, PEM electrolyzers and clean power make green hydrogen more costly than fossil hydrogen.","The United States is adding a lot of solar power. It is also building ways to store that energy as green hydrogen. The idea is simple. Solar makes clean electricity in the day. Electrolyzers use some of that power to split water and make hydrogen. Later, hydrogen turns back into power for the evening and for cloudy hours. This loop is a path to steady, cleaner energy.

What Is Green Hydrogen?

Green hydrogen is made by electrolysis. An electrolyzer uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity is renewable, the hydrogen has very low lifecycle emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Shot sets a clear target: cut the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram

How Solar and Hydrogen Work Together

Solar panels make electricity when the sun shines.

Electrolyzers use part of that power to make hydrogen.

Storage keeps hydrogen in safe tanks or other spaces.

Fuel cells or turbines turn hydrogen back into power at night or during storms.

In short, solar provides energy; hydrogen provides time-shifted energy. NREL research shows electrolyzers can fit well as renewables grow.

Solar Growth in the U.S.

New clean capacity is rising fast. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects about 63 gigawatts of new utility-scale capacity in 2025. More than half is set to be solar. Battery storage also grows, and together they make up about 81% of the expected additions.

EIA also reports that developers brought many gigawatts online this year, with large shares in key states. The growth calls for more storage to keep power reliable after sunset.

Policies and Programs Shaping the Market

Policy / Program What It Does Why It Matters 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Treasury) Final rules set tiers of support based on lifecycle emissions. To qualify as “clean,” hydrogen must be ≤ 4 kg CO2e per kg H2. Lowers costs for the cleanest hydrogen made in the U.S. and gives investors clarity. Finalized Jan. 3, 2025. Hydrogen Shot (DOE) Targets clean hydrogen at $1/kg within a decade. Signals long-term U.S. commitment and supports innovation and scale. Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (DOE) Up to $7 billion to build seven hubs for production, delivery, and use. Kickstarts early markets in power, transport, and industry. Includes demand-side support tools.

Benefits and Trade-Offs

Reliability: Hydrogen stores energy for night and for long gaps. This helps solar do more work.

Lower emissions: Electrolyzers powered by renewables avoid direct CO2. The 45V rules also reward cleaner pathways.

Domestic energy: Hydrogen can be made from water and American power. It can support energy security.

Hard-to-electrify uses: Industry, heavy trucks, and backup power can use clean hydrogen.

Challenges: Electrolyzers and power can be costly today, and new pipes and storage take time. Research points to cost drops as factories scale.

Sector Need How Hydrogen Helps Power Night and seasonal gaps in supply. Long-duration storage for a grid with lots of solar and batteries. Industry High heat and feedstocks. Clean fuel and inputs for steel, chemicals, and refineries in hub plans. Transport Heavy duty, long range, fast refueling. Fuel cells offer zero tailpipe CO2 and quick fills for trucks and fleets.

Costs and Technology Trends

Today, PEM electrolyzers and clean power make green hydrogen more costly than fossil hydrogen. But that gap can shrink. An NREL cost study shows materials, stacks, and power electronics are big cost drivers now. Larger factories and better supply chains can reduce prices over time.

Another NREL study finds that electrolyzers can run when power is cheap and pause when it is not. This flexible mode can lower the cost of hydrogen and help the grid.

Research teams continue to improve electrolyzer efficiency and durability in the U.S. lab network. Work in 2025 focuses on stacks, membranes, and balance-of-plant to raise output and cut costs.

What to Watch in 2025

Project pipelines: EIA expects solar to lead new capacity. Watch grid connections and storage builds through year-end.

45V implementation: The Treasury rules are final. Developers will align designs and contracts to qualify.

Hydrogen hubs: DOE’s hubs move from awards into agreements and then construction. Demand-side tools seek real customers.

Electrolyzer supply: U.S. and global manufacturers scale production. Costs may fall as volumes grow.

Cox Automotive revised its 2025 EV market share forecast from 10% to 8.5%, citing the expiration of incentives and economic uncertainty.
GM and Ford, meanwhile, are focusing on cost efficiency and domestic supply chains to meet tax credit sourcing requirements.
Investors must also consider the Biden administration's broader EV policies, such as production tax credits for batteries and critical minerals.","The U.S. federal EV tax credit, extended through September 30, 2025, has undergone a transformative shift with the IRS's introduction of “contract-based flexibility.” This provision allows consumers to qualify for the $7,500 tax credit by entering a binding contract to purchase an electric vehicle before the deadline, even if delivery occurs afterward. This rule change has profound implications for automakers like Tesla, General Motors (GM), and Ford, reshaping market dynamics, consumer behavior, and stock valuations.

The Mechanics of Contract-Based Flexibility

The IRS's updated guidance defines a binding contract as one with a nominal down payment or trade-in, effectively extending the eligibility window for buyers facing logistical delays. For example, a consumer ordering a vehicle that requires cross-state shipping or is still in production can still claim the credit if the contract is finalized before September 30. This flexibility aligns with legislative intent to treat contracts as purchases, ensuring that supply chain or manufacturing delays don't disqualify buyers.

This provision has created a surge in pre-deadline contracts, particularly for high-demand models. Automakers must now prioritize securing early commitments from buyers, even if delivery is delayed. For Tesla, this means managing expectations for the Model 3 and Model Y, which remain eligible for the full credit. GM and Ford, meanwhile, are leveraging their expanding EV lineups—such as the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford F-150 Lightning—to capture market share before the credit expires.

Consumer Behavior and Market Timing

The contract-based flexibility has accelerated consumer decision-making. According to Cox Automotive, EV sales in Q3 2025 spiked as buyers rushed to lock in contracts before the tax credit's expiration. This surge has been most pronounced for automakers with strong brand loyalty and production capacity. Tesla, for instance, reported 384,122 deliveries in Q2 2025, but this figure masks a 13.5% year-over-year decline, reflecting waning demand as the credit's end looms.

GM, however, has capitalized on the urgency. Its EV sales grew by 111% in Q2 2025, with the Chevrolet brand becoming the second-best-selling EV brand in the U.S. The company's focus on affordability and domestic production—key requirements for tax credit eligibility—has positioned it to outperform rivals. Ford, while less dominant, has seen a 2.62% stock price increase in August 2025, suggesting investor confidence in its ability to navigate the post-credit landscape.

Stock Valuations and Investor Sentiment

The tax credit's expiration has created divergent trajectories for automakers. Tesla's stock, which fell 18% in 2025, faces headwinds as its reliance on regulatory credits and high-end models (which are now ineligible for the leasing loophole) becomes apparent. The company's Q2 2025 earnings showed a 42% drop in operating income, with nearly half tied to regulatory credits. Analysts warn that Tesla's margins could turn negative in the next two quarters, raising concerns about its long-term viability.

GM, in contrast, has demonstrated resilience. Despite a 35.4% drop in net income due to Trump-era tariffs, its EV sales and strategic investments in battery production have bolstered investor confidence. The company's stock rose 3.66% in early August 2025, reflecting optimism about its profitability timeline. Ford's stock, while less volatile, has shown modest gains, indicating a cautious but positive outlook.

The broader EV market is also feeling the ripple effects. Cox Automotive revised its 2025 EV market share forecast from 10% to 8.5%, citing the expiration of incentives and economic uncertainty. This shift has led to a reevaluation of EV stocks, with investors favoring automakers with diversified product lines and strong ICE (internal combustion engine) sales.

Policy Uncertainty and Future Outlook

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) has further complicated the landscape by accelerating the tax credit's expiration and eliminating the leasing loophole. This has forced automakers to pivot strategies. Tesla, for example, is doubling down on Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and robotaxi services to differentiate itself. GM and Ford, meanwhile, are focusing on cost efficiency and domestic supply chains to meet tax credit sourcing requirements.

Investors must also consider the Biden administration's broader EV policies, such as production tax credits for batteries and critical minerals. These incentives could offset some of the post-credit challenges, but their effectiveness remains untested.

Investment Advice

For investors, the key takeaway is to prioritize automakers with strong domestic production capabilities and diversified revenue streams. GM appears best positioned to weather the post-credit era, with its focus on affordability and supply chain resilience. Tesla's long-term potential hinges on its ability to monetize FSD and robotaxi services, but its near-term risks are significant. Ford, while less dominant, offers a safer bet for those seeking exposure to the EV transition without overreliance on tax credits.

In conclusion, the IRS's contract-based flexibility has created a race against time for EV buyers and automakers alike. While the tax credit's expiration poses challenges, it also highlights the importance of innovation, supply chain agility, and strategic foresight. For investors, the next 12 months will be critical in determining which automakers can thrive in a post-incentive world.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 18:04:11.742278

SAN FRANCISCO – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Thursday denied the Trump administration’s request to stay a lower court order requiring the reinstatement of federal research grants that had been terminated earlier this year as part of a sweeping campaign to eliminate funding tied to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.

The case, Thakur v. Trump, was filed by a group of University of California researchers whose multi-year grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) were abruptly cancelled in April. The agencies sent form letters citing changes in priorities and referencing recent executive orders issued by President Trump in January and February 2025. Those orders, which created the Department of Government Efficiency, directed agencies to end projects related to DEI, environmental justice, and similar initiatives.

The plaintiffs alleged the cancellations were unlawful because they were not based on any individualized review of the projects, but instead reflected broad policy directives. They sued in the Northern District of California, arguing the actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the First and Fifth Amendments, and separation of powers. In June, the district court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the reinstatement of the grants and provisionally certified two classes of researchers: one for those who received form termination letters with no individualized reasoning and another for those whose grants were ended under the DEI-related orders.

The government appealed and sought a partial stay of the injunction, limited to grants issued by the EPA and NEH. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, led by Judge Morgan Christen, rejected the request. “We deny the government’s motion,” Christen wrote in the opinion.

The panel found that the government had not shown it was likely to succeed on the merits of its arguments. The court said the termination letters were vague, citing broad rationales such as failure to “serve the best interests of the United States” or inconsistency with agency priorities, without specifying how they applied to particular projects. “The recipients of the form letter and the public were left to guess at the reasons for these terminations,” the court noted.

The opinion highlighted the case of Dr. Neeta Thakur, whose $1.3 million EPA grant to study the impact of wildfire smoke on California communities was terminated seven months before its scheduled end. The court said the government provided no evidence that the EPA considered reliance interests or the taxpayer investments that would be lost if the project was not completed.

On the First Amendment claim, the panel concluded that the government likely engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by targeting projects associated with DEI, environmental justice, and gender-related research. The court rejected the government’s argument that it was simply choosing not to fund certain activities, distinguishing the case from earlier Supreme Court decisions. Instead, the judges found that the administration “selected grants for termination based on viewpoint” and reinforced the principle that, while the government has discretion in allocating subsidies, it cannot suppress disfavored ideas.

The court also rejected the government’s claim that it would suffer irreparable harm by being compelled to disburse funds that it might not later recover. While acknowledging that some funds might not be recouped, the judges found the harms to researchers and the public were more significant. They cited layoffs, disruptions to graduate programs, reputational injury, and the destruction of research projects, along with the waste of taxpayer dollars already invested.

“The government cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice,” the panel wrote, citing its precedent in Rodriguez v. Robbins.

The Ninth Circuit’s ruling leaves intact the district court’s order requiring the reinstatement of the cancelled grants while the case proceeds. The broader litigation will continue to determine whether the Trump administration’s executive orders and resulting grant terminations violated constitutional and statutory limits.

“It can help maximize oil recovery while still maintaining safety and accountability through modern monitoring,” Behrens said.

When asked what else needs to be done for strengthened energy production, Behrens said that “some great next steps could be expanding existing capacity at coal plants to help get more power on the grid and continue their work to bring more reliable and affordable power online.”

“Thankfully, the Trump Administration has the gas pedal to the floor on the road to energy dominance,” Behrens said.

According to the Interior Department news release, the updates made to commingling rules “provide clear standards that support safe operations, improve efficiency and maximize recovery of America’s energy resources.”

The updates are intended to “strengthen energy production and safety.”

The updates are led by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

“BSEE has finalized a rule to clarify expectations for offshore commingling, ensuring production methods protect well integrity, safety and ultimate recovery,” the release said.

Meanwhile, the BLM “is issuing interim guidance to broaden commingling authority on public and tribal lands until updated regulations are complete.”

In addition to aligning with the Big Beautiful Bill’s provisions, the updates to commingling are in accordance with Trump’s executive order “Unleashing American Energy” and support “the Trump administration’s energy and regulatory priorities” by advancing the order’s goals, the release said.

The updates likewise “align with [Department of the Interior] Secretary [Doug] Burgum’s orders emphasizing safe, efficient and predictable oversight of oil and gas operations, reinforcing policies that remove unnecessary regulatory barriers while ensuring maximum resource recovery and environmental protection.”

When reached, the Department of the Interior referred The Center Square to its press release on the updates to commingling, as well as those that concern other recent efforts to “reinforce energy dominance, economic growth, and resource resilience,” as the department told The Center Square. For instance, the Interior Department recently streamlined oil and gas leasing “to advance energy independence and economic growth”; raised the annual Gulf of America revenue-sharing cap to “support coastal protection, restoration and infrastructure projects”; and set an energy leasing schedule “to expand American energy production and strengthen U.S. energy independence.”

In the release, Burgum said that “these updates make it easier to produce American energy without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, while at the same time protecting taxpayers, tribes and our shared energy future by ensuring production is safe, efficient and maximizes the long-term value of our resources.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/08/23095552/667d8a78673f0-image.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 15:01:37.963747

In a statement, Gov. Dan McKee (D-RI) calls the decision to halt the project a big blow to hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders who could have gotten power from the project, saying:

The Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability. This action puts hundreds of union jobs at risk by halting a project that is 80% complete—just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs, and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption. We are working with our partners in Connecticut to pursue every avenue to reverse this decision. Revolution Wind is key to Rhode Island’s economic development, energy security, and long-term affordability for our residents.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Peter Neronha called the project ""absolutely essential"" towards meeting Rhode Island's clean energy goals, releasing a statement saying in part:

Nearly half of the State’s clean energy portfolio, 400MW to be precise, is slated to come from Revolution Wind upon the project’s completion next year. Without Revolution Wind, our Act on Climate is dead in the water. With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate, the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre.

Jobseekers might be surprised to learn clean energy is among the fastest growing careers right now. Labor leaders say developers are getting better at hiring union workers to build wind and solar farms but they see room for improvement in North Dakota.

Industry analysts said the clean energy workforce has a union coverage rate just above 10 percent, compared with 7 percent in the private sector.

Kevin Pranis, Minnesota and North Dakota marketing manager for the Laborers' International Union of North America, said momentum has developed over the past decade.

""We've seen a really positive shift with good union jobs that pay the same rates that members would make on a conventional energy project,"" Pranis explained.

In neighboring Minnesota, he noted they have seen a substantial increase in developers hiring local union members for projects, as opposed to out-of-state teams. And while there's progress in North Dakota, he pointed out on some projects, the percentage is still low.

He acknowledged changing the mindset is hard in a fossil fuel-heavy state but adds developers can help by conveying the wage growth in renewables.

Under the Trump administration, federal incentives for such projects are being scaled back. Pranis predicted a rush of construction jobs for renewable sites over the next two years before key credits expire. Even if demand eventually softens, he argued the sector will still be a force because of plans laid out by utilities and the training members receive pays off in other ways.

""We really train people to be construction professionals, over a set of skills that laborers focus on,"" Pranis emphasized. ""Those skills are applicable, whether it's a solar project, a wind project, a highway, a school.""

Pat Hook, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 683 in Ohio, said another complicating factor is local opposition to wind and solar projects. His union often shows up at public hearings to state the facts and dispel misinformation, so members get a chance to be hired. He sees positive movement in this area.

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island.","The Trump administration has ordered companies to stop construction of a wind farm that's being built off the coast of Rhode Island.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

""This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,"" Burdock said. ""In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5786x3255+0+301/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2Faa%2F10fd41f4471693bc183be3012ec6%2Fap25212463742062.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 14:02:35.070684

The difference is that the Stated Policies Scenario assumes certain future policy actions, such as the extension and renewal of policies with end dates.
A Current Policies Scenario only includes the policy as written, meaning that the scenario assumes those tax credits would end, since their (likely) renewal wasn’t in writing.
A Stated Policy Scenario assumes, on the basis of policy analysis and stated aims, that the tax credits would be renewed.
The international agency very quietly confirmed in March calendar notice that this year will mark the much-debated return of the Current Policies Scenario.","A great debate is unfolding about the subjectivity of data in producing the energy outlooks that guide public policy and private spending, shaping the future of the global energy sector. The International Energy Agency has been caught in the crossfire of a partisan debate in which environmental and energy industry leaders vehemently disagree about what constitutes accuracy, truth, and good science in data, and particularly in the agency’s flagship World Energy Outlook report. And this year, the fossil fuels industry is getting its way.

It’s easy to forget that data is not objective, nor is it purely subjective. This false dichotomy, according to data expert Melanie Feinberg, “distorts the empirical realities of data collection, the challenging work of forcing unruly phenomena to speak in clean, distinct, ideally quantitative phrases.” Instead, good science is about recognizing the responsibility of being an active decision-maker to produce methods and outputs that most accurately represent complex realities.

Human-led decisions and difficult choices are being made at every step of developing a report like the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s annual World Energy Outlook – from how to collect and clean the data to how to analyze and report on it. One of those critical choices is how the agency chooses to construct its projected scenarios for the clean energy transition and the phaseout of fossil fuels.

The choice that has recently come under scrutiny is whether to include a “Current Policies Scenario” along with the typical scenarios that the agency uses to make its forecasts. The IEA based its “business as usual” outlooks on current policies until 2019, when the agency decided to switch to a “Stated Policies Scenario,” which it believed to be more accurate. The difference is that the Stated Policies Scenario assumes certain future policy actions, such as the extension and renewal of policies with end dates.

As an example, before the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States implemented solar and wind power tax credits that expired every few years, at which point they would be reviewed and adjusted as needed. A Current Policies Scenario only includes the policy as written, meaning that the scenario assumes those tax credits would end, since their (likely) renewal wasn’t in writing. A Stated Policy Scenario assumes, on the basis of policy analysis and stated aims, that the tax credits would be renewed. The argument is that while this is not based on concrete policy, it is a more accurate representation of policy – and ultimately a more accurate projection.

This change in modeling has resulted in projections that foresee a much more rapidly approaching peak fossil fuel demand. This change has yielded some harsh critiques, especially from Republican leadership. Robert McNally, president of research and analysis firm Rapidan Energy and former energy advisor for President George W. Bush, wrote an op-ed earlier this year slamming the IEA for being “neutered” by “climate politics.” McNally wrote for the Wall Street Journal that the EIA’s energy modeling is posing “significant risks” to global energy systems by encouraging underinvestment in oil and gas, thereby undermining “its vital security mission.”

The Trump administration has also been a vocal critic of the IEA, and has recently threatened to withdraw from the agency due to what it sees as ""unrealistically green” forecasting. “We will do one of two things: we will reform the way the IEA operates or we will withdraw,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright last month. “My strong preference is to reform it.”

And now we know that the IEA has yielded to this pushback. The international agency very quietly confirmed in March calendar notice that this year will mark the much-debated return of the Current Policies Scenario. The IEA statement noted that this year’s report will include a ""wide spectrum of possible outcomes that today's markets and policies imply,"" encompassing “exploratory scenarios that flow from different assumptions about existing policies, including the Current Policies Scenario, as well as normative pathways that achieve energy and emissions goals in full.""

This marks a major policy reversal on the part of the agency, which had previously ardently defended its choice to drop the model. It also reflects a rapidly changing global policy environment that is more concerned with immediate-term energy security rather than long-term climate realities.

Building out a profitable EV business is not easy, with even major automakers often struggling to sell their EV models for a profit.
Both Tesla and Rivian stocks carry their fair share of risk.
Rivian is still unprofitable and faces near-term headwinds from tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits.
For investors willing to take on risk, Rivian is the better EV stock to own in my view.","Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) has dominated the electric vehicle (EV) market for over a decade, but the company's core business has begun to struggle. Rivian Automotive (RIVN 8.00%), meanwhile, is still in the early innings as an automaker, but is starting to hit important milestones.

Both stocks come with risk, but one has a much better setup for investors right now.

Rivian's R2 opportunity

Rivian slipped back into negative gross margins in Q2 after two straight positive quarters, with higher material costs due to supply constraints and new tariffs taking their toll. The loss of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit this fall will be another drag. Those are real headwinds, but they don't take away from the progress that Rivian has been making.

Building out a profitable EV business is not easy, with even major automakers often struggling to sell their EV models for a profit. However, Rivian took a big step in this direction when it switched to a zonal architecture. This slashed the number of electronic control units and wiring in its vehicles, making its SUVs cheaper to build. It also helped the company secure a major partnership with Volkswagen, which opened up its checkbook to gain access to the technology and form a joint venture.

The next big step for Rivian will be launching its new, smaller R2 SUV next year. At a starting price of around $45,000, it will target a much broader audience than the R1 luxury line, which costs over $100,000 for some versions. Importantly, Rivian has locked in costs through supplier contracts and expects the R2 to deliver stronger margins through lower material costs, higher volumes, and shared fixed expenses with its R1 and electric delivery van lines.

On the financial front, Rivian is backed by Amazon, which uses its delivery vans, and it still has more cash coming from Volkswagen if and when certain milestones are reached. It has also secured a $6.6 billion loan from the Department of Energy to help build a second U.S. plant. With $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of capital to support the R2 launch. Management is targeting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven by 2027, which seems like a realistic timeline if the R2 is successful.

Rivian is still a high-risk name, but it has the balance sheet, the partners, and the right vehicle strategy to grow into a profitable business.

Tesla is losing momentum

Tesla's core auto business has been heading in the wrong direction. Deliveries dropped double digits in each of the past two quarters, while auto revenue slid 16% in Q2. Profitability and cash flow have also taken a hit. Adjusted EPS dropped 23% last quarter, while operating cash flow fell 30% and free cash flow collapsed to just $146 million.

Meanwhile, its high gross margin regulatory credit sales were cut by more than half during the quarter. Musk has already warned investors that things could get worse once the EV tax credit disappears later this year.

Rather than focusing on improving its ailing auto business, Musk has instead continued to try to sell investors on Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics ambitions. The company has launched a small pilot robotaxi program in Austin, Texas, but the service is limited to a geofenced area and requires a Tesla employee as a safety driver. It's also already drawn scrutiny from local officials after several safety incidents.

Tesla is promising a rapid rollout of robotaxis across half the U.S. by year-end pending regulatory approvals, but the technology does not appear ready. Its decision to eschew lidar technology and use a camera-only approach remains controversial. This design saves costs, but the technology has struggled in some complex driving conditions, leading to questions around the safety of its approach. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo robotaxi is far ahead, with years of experience operating paid, driverless rides in multiple cities.

Which EV stock wins?

Both Tesla and Rivian stocks carry their fair share of risk. Rivian is still unprofitable and faces near-term headwinds from tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits. Tesla, however, has a weakening auto business, a valuation that assumes big success in robotaxis and robotics, and a CEO whose actions have hurt the brand with many consumers.

Between the two, Rivian looks like the better investment. The company is improving its cost structure, expanding its market with the R2 SUV, and has the support of well-financed partners to help fund its growth. Tesla's stock, by contrast, is still priced as if its autonomous driving and robotics bets will pay off, even though it has yet to prove they can.

For investors willing to take on risk, Rivian is the better EV stock to own in my view.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/829926/gettyimages-2032424629.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 16:01:46.702450

Friday afternoon, Ørsted received a letter from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, ordering it to “halt all ongoing activities related to the Revolution Wind Project on the outer continental shelf.” It went on to say that this was to allow time for BOEM to address concerns that have arisen since President Trump’s inauguration day order to stop any new wind projects on federal properties and review all those underway.

Another part of the letter stated that: “In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

Earlier in the week, the U.S. Commerce Department revealed it had opened an investigation the week before “to determine the effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines and their parts and components.” That announcement indicated the results could trigger steep tariffs or quotas “to protect national security.”

BOEM did not respond to emails or phone calls Friday night seeking further information about what the specific security issues were for Revolution Wind or whether the two investigations were related.

The BOEM letter to Ørsted also threatened further “corrective action” if the company did not comply.

Revolution has created about 1200 direct jobs in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Eighty to 120 of them, depending on the activity level at any given time, are at State Pier in New London where much of the onshore work is being done.

The onshore transmission work for Revolution Wind began in the summer of 2023. All federal and state permits were secured in November 2023 and full construction began in early 2024. Presently all of the offshore foundations are in place and 45 of the 65 wind turbines are installed according to Ørsted. Work is slated to be completed by the end of 2026.

Connecticut Congressman Joe Courtney, whose district includes the State Pier, said the federal action puts approximately 200 jobs at risk. He called the administration’s claim of security concerns “particularly galling,” noting that in 2023, a record of decision by BOEM analyzed and addressed national security considerations for the project in coordination with the Department of Defense.

“That exhaustive review ensured that transit by Coast Guard vessels and U.S. Navy warships would not be hindered by the final placement of Revolution Wind towers,” Courtney said.

In a lengthy statement on its website Ørsted said it “is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.”

The statement also said; “Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings.”

So is Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who said in a statement Friday night that “We are evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.”

“Trump wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy. Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers,” Tong said.

Reaction from the Lamont administration echoed this criticism.

“This political move by the Trump administration will drive up the cost of electricity bills and contradicts everything the administration has told us. It wastes years of state investment in renewable energy designed to diversify our energy supply and lower costs for families and businesses,” said Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement Saturday. “We are working closely with Rhode Island to save this project, because it represents exactly the kind of investment that reduces energy costs, strengthens regional production, and builds a more secure energy future, the very goals President Trump claims to support but undermines with this decision.”

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal pointed to the potential impact on electric bills as well.

“The Trump Administration is canceling critical clean energy projects that would lower utility bills and have created good paying union jobs for our state’s workforce,” the Democratic senator said in a statement. “This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason. Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it.”

At the Conservation Law Foundation, which operates throughout New England, Kate Sinding Daly, the group’s senior vice president for law and policy said in a statement: “There is no evident legal basis for this, and it contravenes all common sense. Offshore wind represents the single most significant investment in clean, affordable energy for New England and this specious directive will not only deprive New Englanders of homegrown jobs but exposes us to higher energy bills and increasingly deadly extreme weather.”

Outrage was swift from a number of national groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council. Kit Kennedy, the group’s managing director for power called halting Revolution Wind “a devastating attack on workers, on electricity customers, and on the investment climate in the U.S.”

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power.”

Both have been targeted directly by the Trump administration in the recent reconciliation budget legislation. Their valuable federal tax credits are being eliminated along with other actions that will make them less financially worthwhile.

Only a handful of offshore wind projects remain in development, a sharp departure from the many the Biden administration had approved. It had been assumed those under construction would be safe, but in July the Interior Department announced that it would consider cancelling projects that were challenged in court. The next day, the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation filed suit on behalf of fishermen against a Massachusetts project – Vineyard Wind 1.

The first project stopped by the Trump administration was Empire Wind off New York, which was halted in April. That move was widely seen as a pressure tactic to get New York Governor Kathy Hochul to agree to allow a natural gas pipeline through the state. Hochul has said no deal was made.

That project was restarted after a month, but its developer, Equinor, came close to shutting it down and in the end the company indicated it cost them $1 billion.

Ørsted has had its own financial issues lately. Its stock nosedived earlier this month when the company said it would need more than $9 billion to help finance its only other offshore wind development, Sunrise Wind off Long Island.

American Clean Power CEO Jason Grumet posted online: “This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy. The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments,” he said.

Connecticut has had its own difficulties with offshore wind projects. A large, second project called Park City Wind was cancelled after inflation spurred by COVID and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused its developer, Avangrid, to pull out when its initial costs were no longer sustainable. In the last offshore wind solicitation at the end of the Biden administration, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection opted to forgo any new projects.

In a statement Friday night, Commissioner Katie Dykes called the stop-work order on Revolution “deeply disappointing.”

“Losing this much capacity means higher costs and less reliability for families and businesses in Connecticut and across New England, at a time when we urgently need more affordable, domestically produced energy to strengthen our regional grid,” Dykes said. “Connecticut remains committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, of which offshore wind is a promising and important part.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025.jpeg,N,,2025-08-23 15:01:03.660485

In the LNG process, facilities take natural gas, cool it to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit, load it onto cargo tanks on double-hulled ships and then export it.","ConocoPhillips is going all-in on a massive liquefied natural gas project in Texas that a subsidiary of San Diego energy giant Sempra is building on the Gulf Coast of Texas.

After already agreeing to purchase 5 million metric tons of gas per year from the first phase of the Port Arthur LNG project, ConocoPhillips on Thursday announced a 20-year partnership with Sempra Infrastructure to take an additional 4 million metric tons a year during the second phase of the site’s planned expansion.

The companies did not disclose financial details of the purchase and sale agreement.

The deal “advances our global LNG portfolio strategy as we build a flexible and reliable LNG supply network to meet growing energy demand,” Conoco Phillips CEP Ryan Lance said in a statement.

Still under construction, Sempra Infrastructure’s Port Arthur LNG project will house two large storage tanks and two processing units, called “trains” in the parlance of the industry, that enable specially built tankers to ship some 13.5 metric tons of liquefied gas to destinations around the world each year.

Commercial operations are scheduled to begin in 2027 for the first train and 2028 for the second.

Phase 2 of the project expects to add two more trains to the facility, nearly doubling its export capacity.

Sempra Infrastructure is lining up commitments from banks and financial institutions to underwrite the costs of the buildout, and the company says it plans to announce a final investment decision on Phase 2 later this year.

“This next phase reflects both companies’ shared view of the opportunity to connect American producers of natural gas with growing markets overseas,” Sempra CEO Jeff Martin said, “while also driving economic growth and job creation here at home.”

Sempra has become a major player in the LNG sphere, as countries around the world look to use natural gas rather than coal to help power their electric grids. Markets in Asia are a frequent destination. So is Europe, where U.S.-produced natural gas acts an alternative to gas from Russia.

Sempra Infrastructure is already majority owner of the $10.5 billion Cameron LNG facility on the coast of Louisiana that opened in August 2020. The company is also adding an export component to an existing LNG terminal near Ensenada, Mexico, called Energía Costa Azul, which is expected to be finished by spring of 2026.

Environmental groups oppose LNG because of the amount of methane emitted by natural gas. They say exports extend the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, rather than transitioning to renewable energy sources.

In a letter to Rob Keiser, head of Asset Management for Orsted North America, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cites “national security interests” and the “prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone” as its reasons for issuing the stop-work order.

The 65-turbine project, which is located about 15 nautical miles southeast of Point Judith, Rhode Island, and 12 nautical miles southwest of Martha’s Vineyard, received all necessary permits from the Biden administration after nine years of agency review.

It received its construction and operations plan approval letter on Nov. 17, 2023.

According to company officials, the project is 80% complete, with all offshore foundations and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed. The wind farm was on track to begin producing electricity next spring.

Once fully operational, they said, the facility would produce enough electricity to power more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

The letter from Matthew Giacona, the acting director of BOEM, tells Orsted it “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the project.

In a statement, Orsted acknowledged it had received the letter, and is “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously.”

“This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction,” the statement said.

Just last week, Orsted announced it needs to raise an additional $9.4 billion to shore up its finances to complete both Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, another large offshore wind project near Long Island.

The move comes as the Trump administration’s opposition to offshore wind is exacerbating a pre-existing downturn in the sector.

Among those crying foul over the bureau’s action are the members of the Oceantic Network, a trade group of the offshore energy industry.

According to the group, Revolution Wind has “sparked investments in Louisiana and New England shipyards, the purchase of export cables from a South Carolina factory, and spurred a steel supply chain that crossed New York and created hundreds of union jobs in Providence, Rhode Island.”

In a statement, Liz Burdock, the CEO of the Oceantic Network, accused the Trump administration of taking an “unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction.”

“This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,” Burdock said.

“In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers,” she continued.

Burdock said offshore wind is a “shovel-ready, reliable and affordable energy source ready to power America’s leadership and independence.”

“Operational data from the nation’s first commercial-scale offshore wind project demonstrate energy production and reliability rates on par with traditional sources — performing even better during severe weather and winter months — saving ratepayers in the Northeast hundreds of millions of dollars,” she continued.

“The Oceantic Network and the hundreds of American suppliers that make up its membership urges the Department of the Interior to reverse course immediately and allow this project to move forward,” Burdock said.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, also weighed in, saying his office is “evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.”

“Trump wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy,” the state attorney general said. “Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers.”

In related news, last week, the Commerce Department opened a trade investigation into imported wind turbines and their components.

A federal filing revealed the investigation is looking at internationally-made wind turbines under a Section 232, a legal provision that allows the president to apply tariffs to foreign products if their imports threaten national security.

Trump has previously used the provision to slap significant tariffs on aluminum, cars, copper, and steel.

He is reportedly also considering its use on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, and now, wind turbines.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry.
President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects.
""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said.
In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island.","The Trump administration has ordered companies to stop construction of a wind farm that's being built off the coast of Rhode Island.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

""This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,"" Burdock said. ""In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.""

“When they talk about Iowa, how much electricity they produce from wind power in Iowa, it’s not all consumed in Iowa,” Wright continued.
Wright challenged this line of thinking, noting that wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that they do not produce power around the clock.
The secretary claimed that, without proper battery technology, wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially “worthless” when it is dark and when the wind isn’t blowing.
Just this week, Trump promised not to issue any new approvals for wind and solar projects on farmland.","The secretary’s remarks came just days after Trump escalated his criticism of wind and solar, calling the green energy alternatives “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY” in a social media post. His claim was disputed by clean energy advocates, who have argued that some of the states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power.

“The President’s comments are correct, but the situation is more complicated than that,” Wright said, adding that the discussion needs to have a “country-wide” focus and not zero in on individual states.

He pointed to states such as Iowa and Oklahoma, which have some of the largest shares of renewable energy growth and the smallest electricity price hikes among all states. Wright said their rate hikes have remained low because the states did not close any fossil fuel power plants, leaving that infrastructure in place while adding new wind and solar.

“They generate [wind energy] in those states, but most of it isn’t consumed in those states. They have land. They’re pro-development. They do generate power, and they sell it. They sell it onto the whole grid, not just in their own state,” the secretary said, referring to the fact that Iowa is a part of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s grid and sells its energy directly into that multi-state market.

“When they talk about Iowa, how much electricity they produce from wind power in Iowa, it’s not all consumed in Iowa,” Wright continued. “So when you look at [a] state, you’re just looking at a microcosm of a grid.”

The debate over renewable energy’s role in energy prices comes as electricity prices have continued to rise nationwide for the last two and a half years. During his campaign, Trump promised to lower energy bills for Americans, but he has yet to see prices drop. In July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that electricity prices rose by 5.5% year over year, more than double the rate of inflation.

Wind and solar proponents have cited Iowa and other red-leaning states such as South Dakota and Kansas as proof that there is no causation between generating power from renewable sources and high electricity prices.

American Clean Power, a renewable trade association, has instead claimed that states with the lowest share of renewables in their energy mix are experiencing higher prices.

The group has called on the administration to harness wind and solar, which are widely considered to be the fastest-deployed energy resources, particularly since natural gas and nuclear facilities can take years to build.

“The only significant source of electricity that can be added to the grid during the Trump administration are renewable resources,” ACP CEO Jason Grumet told the Washington Examiner.

“Going forward, in the early 2030s, we will start to see more natural gas — which we need — and by the end of the decade, hopefully we’ll start to see advanced nuclear — which we need,” he added, before criticizing the government for imposing additional hurdles for wind and solar deployment.

“But if the administration truly wants an energy dominance strategy that allows us to power growing manufacturing and data centers, they need to stop actively blocking deployment of renewable power,” Grumet said.

Wright challenged this line of thinking, noting that wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that they do not produce power around the clock.

The secretary claimed that, without proper battery technology, wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially “worthless” when it is dark and when the wind isn’t blowing.

“As you deploy more renewables, you’re basically building a whole separate grid,” Wright said.

“If you take a grid or a system and grow the renewables penetration, you will raise the price of it. The president’s 100% correct in that,” he added.

Wind and solar projects have faced the ire of the administration since Day One, through numerous executive orders and agency actions.

CHRIS WRIGHT DEFENDS DOE REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE DESPITE ‘SMALL MISTAKES’

While Wright has previously acknowledged renewables can be beneficial in some cases, the administration has broadly sought to stymie future development for wind and solar projects under the second Trump administration.

ANN ARBOR—Standing beneath a federally funded solar canopy at Veterans Memorial Park on Thursday, US Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) delivered a blunt warning to Michiganders: President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” isn’t lowering costs—it’s driving them up.

“Michigan families are going to see higher utility bills because of these policies, at a time when energy prices are skyrocketing,” Dingell told reporters. “Cutting solar [federal tax incentives] means fewer low-income households can access affordable, renewable power. Michiganders are going to be saddled with higher utility costs and it’s going to hurt economic development.”

With coal plants kept online, solar and wind projects scrapped, and federal tax credits stripped away, Dingell said Republican-led rollbacks on renewable energy policies are already making life more expensive for Michiganders, as well as stalling progress toward a clean energy future.

Utility bills are up. Jobs are down. And it’s likely going to get worse from here, she said.

Higher bills, fewer jobs

The press conference—organized by the Michigan League of Conservation Voters—brought together local leaders, clean energy advocates, and labor officials to sound the alarm about Trump’s “dirty” energy policies and the Republican-backed budget bill that’s enabling them.

“Trump promised to cut utility costs by 50%. Instead, he’s hiking costs, destroying jobs, and threatening Michigan’s auto industry by stripping away electric vehicle tax credits,” Dingell said. “The rollback of clean energy progress is going to raise costs. People’s utility bills are going up.”

The timing underscored her point. As advocates gathered in Ann Arbor this week, the Trump administration announced it was extending the life of Consumers Energy’s outdated J.H. Campbell coal plant—again. The West Michigan facility was slated to close in May—a move expected to save ratepayers $600 million by 2040. Instead, Trump ordered it to stay open another 90 days, a decision that’s already cost $30 million and could reach $100 million.

“Every day it remains open means more pollution in our air and higher energy costs,” said Lisa Wozniak, director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, in a statement on Thursday. “Our bills are already too high, and Trump’s reckless energy policies are making it worse.”

Bentley Johnson, federal government affairs director at the League of Conservation Voters, said the repeal of tax credits alone will raise household utility bills by up to $110 a year starting next year—and up to $400 within a decade. Federally funded projects on the chopping block include solar arrays at a senior housing center in Oakland County and at the Hillsdale Municipal Airport.

“We’re losing so many tools that help drive down costs, make people’s homes more comfortable, make them healthier,” Johnson said. “At a time when we should be doubling down on clean energy investment, the Trump administration is taking us in the opposite direction.”

Jobs on the line

Michigan’s clean energy sector employs more than 127,000 people—the sixth-most in the country. But that progress is at risk. John Richter of the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association said Trump’s policies will raise the cost of solar projects by 37% and wind by 48%.

By peeling back federal incentives and increasing the cost of renewable energy projects, fewer Michiganders will pursue them—and that will ultimately drive up electric rates, exacerbate the climate crisis, and slow the state’s transition to cleaner forms of energy, Richter explained.

“Our electric rates will go up even faster than they have been,” he said. “These higher electric rates hit household budgets directly, and they also act as a damper on economic expansion.”

Jonathan Smith, chief deputy director of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, also noted that Michigan had been on track to create at least 750 new jobs through the now-canceled Solar for All program. Those jobs, he said, are no longer coming to fruition.

“These repeals have devastating consequences—not just for the environment, but for the pocketbooks of Michiganders and their families who are no longer going to have access to these good-paying jobs,” Smith said.

Ann Arbor Sustainability Director Missy Stults also reminded the crowd of what’s at stake.

She pointed to the solar canopy above them—funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—as proof that federal investments work. The project has already saved residents millions in utility costs and made critical facilities like fire stations more resilient to outages, she said.

“Every home and business that gets solar sees bill reductions. We’ve helped people save $24 million in lifetime energy costs,” Stults said. “That’s real money that stays in our economy. But now, because of decisions being made in DC, families across Michigan are going to pay more.”

Dingell’s call to action

For Dingell, the fight for cleaner forms of energy is both personal and political.

She said she’s been struggling with asthma worsened by wildfire smoke from Canada—a reminder, she said, that climate change is real and already harming Michiganders’ health.

“Michigan has been a leader on clean energy and we need to keep it that way,” she said.

Dingell told The ‘Gander that Congress can’t undo all of Trump’s damage, but Michigan voters can make a big difference by electing new leadership in the next statewide election.

“Elections have consequences. The next election is November of 2026. When we win, we are going to have to move very quickly,” Dingell said. “But we can’t do this political ping-pong ball back and forth. The American people have to speak up and speak out. You can’t just be quiet.”

Trump continues to bellow about the “energy dominance” thing, which clearly means helping fossil fuels and hurting the green alternatives.","President Donald Trump’s energy policy is utterly screwed up — if you assume America’s interests, and not pleasing his fossil fuel friends, are the objective.

This came to the fore when trade adviser Peter Navarro hollered at India for buying Russian oil. Navarro called the purchases “opportunistic and deeply corrosive” of efforts to isolate Russia and curb Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Oh, is Trump isolating Putin? Could fool us.

Navarro is right that Russia’s oil wealth is funding Putin’s savage attacks on Ukraine. If so, then wouldn’t it be in our interests to speed the move away from fossil fuels? That’s the path Western Europe took shortly after the Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.

On the contrary, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is now demanding that projects “related to wind and solar energy facilities” go through new layers of political review. In other words, slow or kill them. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has canceled a federal loan guarantee to build an $11 billion transmission line through the Heartland. The Grain Belt Express was to send electricity generated by Kansas wind farms across four states. The states involved — Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana — had all approved the project. For reasons easy to guess, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley sided with Trump against the venture.

Invenergy, the Grain Belt Express developer, called Hawley’s opposition “bizarre.” Writing on X, the company accused Hawley of being against an infrastructure project “aligned with the President’s energy dominance agenda.”

As though Trump has an energy dominance agenda, as opposed to a slogan. Does he believe that, well into the 21st century, fossil fuels are the golden-brick road to energy dominance? If he does, that would be most concerning of all.

Trump clearly hasn’t read China’s plan for “energy dominance.” China now dominates in electric vehicles, solar, wind and batteries. Electricity now accounts for 30 percent of its energy consumption versus only 20 percent in the U.S. The Financial Times reports that China is on its way to becoming the first “electrostate.”

Electric vehicles represent both the present and future of transport. Trump is actively handing the EV market to China. He started by pushing Republicans to kill federal tax credits incentivizing Americans to buy or lease electric vehicles. Ford CEO Jim Farley recently called China’s rise in the EV market the “most humbling experience” of his career. “Their cost, their quality of their vehicles is far superior to what I see in the West.”

Also gone are tax credits for wind and solar power. As a result, dozens of EV or clean energy projects — investments totaling $27 billion — have been canceled.

Over half of Iowa’s electricity now comes from wind power. And on sunny and windy days in Texas, wind and solar power can supply over 60 percent of the grid’s fuel mix.

Trump continues to bellow about the “energy dominance” thing, which clearly means helping fossil fuels and hurting the green alternatives. He also goes on about cheaper gas, which is not what the oil business wants for obvious reasons.

More than 10,000 annual pre-term births are attributable to fine particulate matter from oil and gas, the authors found, also linking 216,000 annual childhood-onset asthma cases to the sector’s nitrogen dioxide emissions and 1,610 annual lifetime cancer cases to its hazardous air pollutants.

The highest number of impacts are seen in California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, while the per-capita incidences are highest in New Jersey, Washington DC, New York, California and Maryland.

The analysis by researchers at University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute is the first to examine the health impacts – and unequal health burdens – caused by every stage of the oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use.

“We’ve long known that these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well as health burden,” said Karn Vohra, a postdoctoral research fellow in geography at University College London, who led the paper. “We were able to just put numbers to what that looks like.”

While Indigenous and Hispanic populations are most affected by pollution from exploration, extraction, transportation and storage, Black and Asian populations are most affected by emissions from processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution and usage.

Though the latter set of activities is responsible for less air pollution overall than the former, the study shows they cause the most unequal health burden, with impacts concentrated in majority-Black areas including southern Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” and eastern Texas.

“What makes the study so valuable is how it dissects health impacts across the whole life cycle of oil and gas – from where it comes out of the ground to where it is combusted,” Timothy Donaghy, research director for the environmental group Greenpeace USA and author of previous research on the racially uneven burdens of fossil fuel pollution. “As many studies have found before, these health burdens are not shared equally – a prime example of fossil fuel racism in action.”

For the analysis, published in Science Advances on Friday, the authors developed an inventory of each stage of oil and gas production and use, with data from the federal government and the University of Colorado Boulder. They plugged that data into a computer model to track pollution from each source, and used epidemiological and health data to track the adverse impacts of those emissions.

These disproportionate impacts are not inexplicable; rather, they are attributable to historic policies such as redlining – a discriminatory mortgage appraisal practice used after the Great Depression by the US government – and high rates of permitting for oil and gas processing plants in close proximity to Black communities.

Oil and gas are responsible for a major share of all air pollution-attributable health impacts in the US, the authors also found: one in five pre-term births and adult deaths linked to fine particulate pollution are from the sector, the authors found, while a stunning 90% of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution are from oil and gas.

The study is based on data from 2017, the most recent year of complete data available. Between that year and 2023, US oil and gas production has increased by 40% and consumption by 8%, meaning the estimates are probably highly conservative.

The research comes as the Trump administration works to boost fossil fuel production and suppress renewable energy production.

“Given the reckless deregulation being pushed by Trump’s EPA and the president’s call to ‘drill, baby, drill’, this new study should be a flashing red warning light for the nation,” said Donaghy.

Eloise Marais, a University College London professor of geography and study co-author, said she hoped the study was “picked up by the kinds of community leaders and advocacy groups that are pushing for exposure to cleaner air”.

“If there was a move away from reliance on oil and gas, we would experience the climate change benefits 50, 100, 200 years from today because the greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere so long,” she said. “But communities would experience the health benefits immediately.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a507531a55ca882affdb1c4315f9729cb9bf85d6/562_0_5624_4504/master/5624.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95da076d2787baf8ebe31e0fee14a89c",N,,2025-08-23 14:03:34.311645

AMARILLO, Texas — In the windswept plains of the Texas Panhandle, where cattle once defined economic prosperity, a new kind of infrastructure is taking shape—one that could fundamentally reshape how America powers its digital future.

Fermi America's announcement today of an 11-gigawatt private energy grid represents more than ambitious corporate planning. It signals the emergence of a parallel power economy, where tech giants and energy developers are constructing vast, self-contained electrical systems to bypass the increasingly strained public grid that has served America for over a century.

The scale is staggering. This single facility would generate enough electricity to power roughly 8 million homes—larger than the peak demand of many individual states. Yet it will serve primarily artificial intelligence computing centers, the power-hungry engines driving America's technological supremacy in an increasingly competitive global landscape.

When Public Infrastructure Meets Private Ambition

The partnership announced between Fermi America, engineering firm Parkhill, and construction giant Lee Lewis Construction reflects a broader recalibration occurring across the American energy landscape. Data centers, particularly those serving AI workloads, now consume approximately 4-4.5% of U.S. electricity—a figure projected to potentially triple by 2028 according to Department of Energy scenarios.

(Projected U.S. data center electricity consumption and capacity signals tied to AI workloads; figures reflect recent analyses and forecasts and illustrate a steep upward trajectory from mid‑2020s baselines into the 2030s.)

Traditional utility interconnection processes, designed for predictable industrial loads, are buckling under requests for unprecedented amounts of instantaneous power. Interconnection queues now stretch years into the future, while the specialized equipment required—massive transformers, gas turbines, high-voltage switchgear—faces backlogs extending 5-7 years.

Did you know? An electricity interconnection queue is the grid’s waiting list where new power projects—like solar, wind, batteries, or large loads—undergo engineering studies to ensure they can connect safely and identify any transmission upgrades and costs; because applications surged far faster than grid capacity and planning, many regions face years-long backlogs, with “zombie” projects that never advance clogging the line, prompting reforms such as cluster studies and “first-ready, first-served” rules to speed up approvals, reduce speculative entries, and unlock more clean energy.

This infrastructure bottleneck has created what energy analysts describe as a ""shadow grid"" economy. Major technology companies are increasingly bypassing public utilities entirely, opting instead for dedicated generation facilities that can deliver power on accelerated timelines.

Microsoft's 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island's Unit 1, providing 835 megawatts exclusively for data centers, exemplifies this trend. Amazon Web Services secured an even larger commitment—1.92 gigawatts from the Susquehanna nuclear facility in Pennsylvania through 2042. Oracle and OpenAI are developing over 5 gigawatts of capacity across multiple U.S. sites, including a flagship facility in Abilene, Texas.

The Texas Advantage: Policy, Geography, and Ambition Converge

Texas has emerged as the epicenter of this private grid revolution, offering a combination of regulatory flexibility, abundant land, and political support that other states struggle to match. The state's recently passed House Bill 14 created a $350 million Advanced Nuclear Development Fund and established a dedicated nuclear office—explicit signals of official support for next-generation energy infrastructure.

The ERCOT grid, Texas's independent power market, has demonstrated greater willingness to accommodate large, behind-the-meter installations compared to more regulated markets in other regions. State policymakers have publicly discussed scenarios where electricity demand could nearly double, driven primarily by data center growth and related industrial development.

Did you know? Texas runs most of its own electric grid through ERCOT, a nonprofit system operator that manages power for about 90% of the state and over 26 million customers. It’s largely isolated from the Eastern and Western U.S. grids—connected only by a few DC ties—so ERCOT balances supply and demand in real time within Texas, operating an energy-only market and dispatching power across tens of thousands of miles of transmission lines without owning any generation or wires. This unique setup, overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, has helped Texas rapidly add wind, solar, and battery storage—but it also limits the state’s ability to import power during extreme weather, which can amplify reliability and price risks.

Fermi America's choice of Amarillo reflects careful strategic positioning. The location sits adjacent to the Department of Energy's Pantex facility and benefits from existing high-voltage transmission infrastructure. More importantly, it provides access to the Ogallala Aquifer—a critical consideration for facilities requiring substantial water resources for cooling.

The company's local partnerships signal an understanding that mega-scale infrastructure projects require more than favorable regulations. Parkhill, founded in 1944 and headquartered in Lubbock, brings seven decades of engineering expertise to the project. Lee Lewis Construction, which has appeared on Engineering News-Record's Top 400 Contractors list for over 40 consecutive years, provides the construction management capabilities essential for delivering projects of this complexity.

Nuclear Renaissance Meets Digital Demand

Perhaps most significantly, Fermi America's plans incorporate four Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactors, potentially providing 4.4 gigawatts of carbon-free baseload power. This nuclear component distinguishes the project from purely gas-fired alternatives and positions it within the broader resurgence of American nuclear energy.

The AP1000 design, already certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, offers a pathway to large-scale nuclear deployment that bypasses some of the regulatory uncertainties that have plagued the industry. However, recent experience with AP1000 construction—most notably at Plant Vogtle in Georgia—demonstrates that even certified designs face substantial execution challenges. The Georgia project ultimately required approximately 15 years and over $30 billion to complete.

Industry analysts suggest that Fermi America's near-term development will likely emphasize natural gas generation and energy storage, with nuclear components representing a longer-term expansion phase. This phased approach reflects practical realities around equipment availability, regulatory timelines, and capital requirements.

Investment Implications and Market Dynamics

For sophisticated investors, the Fermi announcement represents both opportunity and cautionary signal. The immediate value creation lies in the supply chain serving these massive infrastructure projects—high-voltage transformers, gas turbines, specialized cooling systems, and project finance structures.

Equipment manufacturers face unprecedented order backlogs. General Electric Vernova, Siemens Energy, and Mitsubishi are experiencing multiyear delays for large gas turbines, while transformer manufacturers struggle with both supply chain constraints and skilled labor shortages. Companies that have secured early positions in these supply chains may significantly outperform broader market expectations.

The financing requirements for these projects create opportunities in specialized project finance and infrastructure debt markets. Facilities of this scale require innovative capital structures that balance construction risk, operational performance, and long-term power purchase agreements with technology companies.

However, execution risks remain substantial. Water resources in the Texas Panhandle face increasing stress, particularly during drought cycles. Even closed-loop cooling systems require significant water makeup, and public opposition to large industrial water users has intensified across the Southwest.

Regulatory evolution presents another uncertainty. While Texas currently maintains a supportive stance toward private grid development, cost-shift concerns among traditional utility customers could prompt policy adjustments. If private facilities avoid contributing to transmission infrastructure costs while maintaining grid interconnection rights, regulators may impose new charges or operating restrictions.

The Broader Energy Transformation

The scale of announced private grid projects suggests that America is entering a period of fundamental energy infrastructure transformation comparable to the rural electrification programs of the 1930s or the interstate highway system of the 1950s.

Beyond individual project announcements, this trend reflects the inadequacy of existing institutional arrangements to meet the demands of a rapidly digitalizing economy. Traditional utility planning processes, designed around incremental load growth and centralized generation, are proving insufficient for the concentrated, high-density demands of artificial intelligence computing.

Geothermal energy represents another emerging component of this transformation. Google's partnership with Fervo Energy, scaling from initial 3.5-megawatt pilots to 115 megawatts in Nevada, demonstrates the potential for 24/7 carbon-free energy sources that complement solar and storage.

Looking Forward: Risks and Opportunities

The success of projects like Fermi America's Amarillo facility will likely determine whether private grids become a permanent feature of the American energy landscape or represent a temporary response to current infrastructure constraints.

Water availability will prove critical. The Ogallala Aquifer, while substantial, faces long-term depletion pressures that could intensify with multiple large industrial users. Technological solutions—closed-loop systems, air-side economization, advanced cooling technologies—may mitigate but not eliminate these constraints. Historical water level changes in the Ogallala Aquifer, illustrating the long-term depletion trend.

Time PeriodAverage Water-Level Change (feet)Change in Recoverable Water in Storage (acre-feet)Predevelopment (approx. 1950) to 2015-15.8-273.2 million2013 to 2015-0.6-10.7 millionPredevelopment (approx. 1950) to 2019-16.5-286.4 million2017 to 2019+0.1+1.6 million

Equipment supply chains represent the most immediate bottleneck. Companies that can secure delivery slots for critical components—particularly large transformers and gas turbines—will determine project timelines more than regulatory processes or financing availability.

The broader question involves system integration. As private grids proliferate, their interaction with public utilities during emergency conditions, maintenance periods, and demand fluctuations will require new regulatory frameworks and operating procedures.

For investors positioned in the infrastructure value chain—from specialized engineering firms to equipment manufacturers to project developers—the current environment offers potentially exceptional returns for those who can navigate execution complexities and regulatory evolution.

The age of private power has arrived, reshaping not only how America generates electricity, but who controls the infrastructure that will determine technological leadership in the decades ahead. Fermi America's 11-gigawatt vision may prove ambitious, but the trend it represents appears both irreversible and accelerating.

Worden's visit also exemplified a bridge between innovation, education, and mentorship. His longstanding relationship with MIT, beginning with support from Harold “Doc” Edgerton who provided him with lab space as a freshman, through to delivering insights gleaned from a ""MIT fire-hose style"" hydrodynamics lecture, showcases the intertwined journey of education and application. The drive to inspire and educate remains a core aspect to Worden's engagements at MIT and beyond. ""There's a lot of connections,"" he remarked, reflecting on his ventures and the support that came full circle.

On a broader scale, the development and demonstration of the Anita represent a step forward in the pursuit of environmentally friendly transportation solutions.

Officials have unveiled plans for the city's first community-driven, freight-focused electric vehicle charging depot, which will be paired with a welcome center and workforce development hub in Hunts Point in the South Bronx.

The project, led by NYC-based MN8 Energy and announced by the New York City Economic Development Corp., will bring more than 40 light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EV charging stations to the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, one of the largest in the world.

The development will also include 10,000 square feet of indoor space dedicated to shared community areas, commercial businesses, and job training programs. The goal is to cut pollution from diesel trucks, improve air quality, and create new ""green collar"" jobs where they're needed most.

""For decades, the Hunts Point community has been unjustly oversaturated by air pollution due to truck traffic,"" Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson said. Swapping diesel engines for clean EVs could greatly reduce harmful air pollution, helping improve the public's respiratory health and lowering noise pollution. And by modernizing freight transport, the project could lower operational costs for businesses, savings that may reach consumers.

""This isn't just about charging trucks — it's about creating opportunity and jobs, improving air quality, and building a more equitable clean energy future,"" said Alan Dowdell, head of distributed energy solutions at MN8 Energy. Elijah Hutchinson, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice, called the effort a ""shining example"" of how environmental justice and economic development can go hand in hand.

The initiative also builds on the Bronx Is Breathing program, which recently rolled out the city's first electric refuse truck.

The U.S. government announced opposition this month to a United Nations (UN) plan that would establish global carbon emission standards and fees for the shipping industry. The proposal, called the “Net-Zero Framework,” was approved by a committee of the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) in April and will face a full vote in October. If adopted, it would take effect in 2027, imposing costs on ships that exceed certain emission limits and offering incentives for lower-emitting vessels. U.S. officials say the plan would significantly raise costs for American consumers and businesses.

In a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the nation will not support measures that increase domestic shipping expenses and may respond if the proposal is enacted.

They said in the joint release, “Whatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization. These fuel standards would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale. These standards would also preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where U.S. industry leads such as liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels.“

The secretaries continued, “Under this framework, ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets. These fees will drive up energy and transportation and leisure cruise costs. Even small vessels would incur millions of dollars in fees, directly driving up costs for American consumers.“

The administration stated the decision is part of a broader approach to limit international control over U.S. energy policy. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin is also reviewing existing climate regulations, projecting substantial cost savings if certain rules are rolled back.

State incentives, called TECH Clean California Incentives, launched about a month ago and will run out quickly.","You may be wondering, when do the electrification incentives run out? Well, in a sense, they never run out. The climate is warming, which is as good a reason as any to reduce your use of gas. While it’s been a cool summer in coastal California, those of you who visited Europe for vacation have gotten a direct sense of this. It is also likely that gasoline prices will be going up. The Energy Institute at UC Berkeley produces a terrific blog, and the latest talks about how the closure of two California-based oil refineries will affect gasoline prices in the state. It is less clear what will happen with natural gas prices in Palo Alto (natural gas is used to heat many homes here), but the fact that the current proposal has gas bills going up by 20% on average cannot be reassuring. These incentives to electrify have no expiration date.

However, there are even more incentives to electrify, $1000s of dollars worth, some of which do have an expiration date. You can learn more about them on the city’s residential electrification site, or by watching this informative video made by several local experts in home electrification. But I will also try to summarize some of the information here for you.

City of Palo Alto Incentives

First of all, the city has some substantial incentives available. There is no expiration date on these, though at some point the money will run out.

On top of this, the city is offering meaningful assistance for residents who want to electrify. There is a super easy program to install heat pump water heaters at low cost. The city’s installers are very experienced with these installations and they use good equipment.

In addition, Palo Alto has partnered with QuitCarbon to help people who are looking to go beyond water heaters, or who have circumstances that make it challenging for them to replace their gas appliances (e.g., an electrical panel that is maxed out). These consultants are on top of the fast-moving field of home electrification, and they know lots of ways to help homeowners find the equipment they want while also saving money. For example, the QuitCarbon folks know many techniques for getting more out of an existing electric panel, they have experience with different configurations for heating water (e.g., for those of you who have instant-hot gas heaters), and they know the ins and outs of multiple options for heating and cooling homes with efficient electric appliances.

Their phone assistance is free of charge. Another great (free) service they provide is they will help you to evaluate contractor bids. They will help you to identify which contractors are properly evaluating the project and whether their pricing is fair.

State of California Incentives

On top of these (yes, these can be layered) are both state and federal incentives. State incentives, called TECH Clean California Incentives, launched about a month ago and will run out quickly. If you want to take advantage of these, you need to act fast and use a TECH-enrolled contractor. The city has a list of contractors who have done electrification work in the city, and QuitCarbon can help you identify those that would qualify for these incentives.

One notable thing with the state’s TECH Clean rebates is the incentive for air-to-water heat pumps, which are used for electrifying hydronic systems. Those of you in Eichlers with radiant floors, this is for you!

Federal Incentives

Finally, there are federal incentives in the form of tax credits. The tax credits for electric vehicles and chargers expire on September 30. These vehicles make so much sense around here. They are fun to drive; they are quiet, odor-free, and very low-maintenance; they use inexpensive electricity; and you can charge them at home. They save you money, and even more so if you can buy one in the next month.

Federal incentives for residential electrification expire at the end of the year. So you have more time there. QuitCarbon can help you to navigate these.

These incentives all stack on top of each other. My across-the-street neighbors had replaced their aging radiant system with mini splits a few years ago. A few weeks ago they installed a heat pump water heater. My neighbor rattled off to me so many incentives and discounts they received that I couldn’t keep track, and on top of that they got a $2500 bonus for disconnecting their home from gas. Pretty unbelievable.

Want to Learn More?

We are very fortunate to live in a city that is pulling out all the stops to help wean us off of gas, keep our home energy bills low, and shepherd us into the modern era of clean, efficient electric homes and vehicles. Our city is deploying not only financial incentives but also very knowledgeable concierge-level assistance.

But our city can only do so much. We residents also have to step up. Fortunately it takes just one phone call. A heat pump water heater will reduce your gas use by one-third while insulating you from gas price swings. And you don’t even need to find a contractor. Start here for that. For more general questions, or to get a holistic look at your home, start with our full-home concierge here.

I’d love to hear from those of you who have electrified some part of your home — how has it gone? — and from those of you who are thinking about it and have questions.

The state-owned company, responsible for managing production, transportation, and distribution of energy, leads this initiative that aims to strengthen renewable infrastructure and reduce costs in the expansion of the provincial electrical grid.

Mining and clean energy: a strategic alliance for development

Historically linked to gold and silver mining, San Juan now plans to move towards the extraction of strategic minerals such as copper, essential for clean technologies.

With less than a million inhabitants and 4838 registered mining jobs in 2024, the province was the second in mining exports between 2019 and 2023, according to official data.

Representatives of EPSE and the mining sector agree that renewable energy generation and solar technology manufacturing are solid complements for mining development. “We have one of the best solar radiation rates in the world. We can become a hub for the renewable industry,” says Estrada.

San Juan, leader in solar generation nationwide

Thanks to sustained political decisions, San Juan has 66.4% of installed solar power, according to Cammesa data, the administrator of the Argentine wholesale electricity market. The rest is divided among large hydroelectric plants and, to a lesser extent, thermal power plants, like a 30 MW plant that only operates during peak demand.

Since 2017, the province stopped importing electricity and became a net exporter, achieving a positive balance between generation and consumption. The current focus is on increasing available power, especially to supply the energy demand of the mining sector, as part of the San Juan Solar Project, initiated in 2007 to take advantage of the high heliophany of the region.

Argentina’s first solar panel factory prepares for production[/caption>

From solar parks to industrial production: milestones of a comprehensive energy policy

In 2011, San Juan inaugurated the first solar park in South America, San Juan 1. Currently, there are 21 operational solar parks and five under construction, most developed in partnership with private companies that lease land and manage operations.

The solar panel factory, on the other hand, is a strategic state project, designed to supply local infrastructure, reduce costs, and strengthen the electrical grid. Additionally, Estrada anticipates seeking to export components and establish links with international actors, especially from China, Europe, and the United States.

An expanding solar economy

“We are going to transform San Juan’s economy by investing mining resources in renewable energies,” says Estrada, who highlights milestones such as the completion of the first wind farm, the development of provincial solar and wind maps, and the progress of the solar panel factory.

This development model aims to integrate energy production, technological innovation, and territorial sustainability, positioning San Juan as a national benchmark in energy transition.

USA Today reported that recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed that ""between May 2024 and May 2025, the average retail residential price for 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity increased about 6.5%.""

What's happening?

""Americans are paying more for electricity this summer"" due in part to hotter weather, and partly because data centers are siphoning more energy for AI, the paper explained.

A study backed by the Department of Energy predicted that the demand for power from these data centers will increase threefold over the next three years, requiring as much as 12% of the U.S.'s total electricity supply.

Why is this concerning?

Residents of some states have already seen an increase in their electricity costs due to increased data center activity.

According to the Washington Post, areas serviced by PJM Interconnection — including Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia — have seen AI-related increases in their electricity costs.

""Electricity bills for some consumers in New Jersey have increased by 20% and in Ohio, prices rose between 10% and 15%,"" USA Today noted.

In early June, some residents in the PJM Interconnection provider region saw their utility bills rise by a staggering 180%.

Additionally, a Jack Kemp Foundation report warned Virginia residents that their energy prices could increase 70% due to growing demand from data centers.

What can be done about rising energy prices?

While electricity costs vary based on local taxes, utility fees, and energy rates, installing solar panels can save customers thousands of dollars each year.

The upfront costs of solar panels could be prohibitive to some customers, but leasing can be an affordable alternative. Palmetto's LightReach leasing program makes it easier for homeowners to install solar panels while minimizing initial expenses.

Palmetto also offers plans with no down payment required, making home solar even more accessible.

If leasing isn't your preference, EnergySage provides free online quotes from vetted local installers, making the switch to solar easier than ever.

Voters in Taiwan are headed to the polls on Saturday to decide whether Taipei should reignite its nuclear power capabilities as the island faces immense energy vulnerabilities amid growing concern over threats posed by China.

In May, Taiwan shut the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant — its last remaining nuclear plant — after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pledged in 2016 to phase out nuclear power by 2025 over concerns relating to nuclear fallout following the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan.

Security experts have since been sounding the alarm that the move further exposes Taiwan’s vulnerabilities to China as the island is highly dependent on energy imports, relying heavily on nations like the U.S., Australia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar for both Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and crude oil imports.

""Taiwan's energy dependence is an Achilles heel,"" Craig Singleton, China Program senior director and senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said during a media call following a delegation’s visit to the island earlier this month.

""Beijing can exploit this issue without firing a single shot,"" he added, noting the ease at which China can cut off trade to the island. ""China can leverage its maritime dominance, its legal warfare and cyber tools to choke supply and test Taiwan's political resilience.""

Over the last decade, Taiwan has imported up to 97% of its energy needs, largely through fossil fuel options, which currently make up a little over 90% of its energy usage, while renewables reportedly make up another 7%, according to FDD experts.

Though prior to its decision to cut ties with the alternative energy option, nuclear power was a strong supply source and provided nearly 12% of the island’s needs in 2011.

By 2021, that supply had dropped to roughly 9.5% and by the following year it had dipped to just over 4% before completely being eliminated this year.

Nuclear power for some nations, especially in Europe, has become a solution as they look to drop dependence on carbon-emitting fuels amid escalating concern over climate change.

TRUMP'S REPORTED SNUB OF TAIWAN PRESIDENT SPURS CONCERNS OVER DEFERENCE TO CHINA

But some nations, like Germany, have taken a strong anti-nuclear approach over concerns relating to nuclear fallout — as seen following the devastating consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, which not only affected those in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine, but had resounding effects across Europe.

Berlin in 2023 also phased out nuclear power entirely — but Taiwan is facing some glaring security challenges that Germany is not.

Some opponents of nuclear power have also pointed out that wartime scenarios in recent years have shown the security risks surrounding active nuclear power plants — as seen during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its fight over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

But experts also argue that Taiwan would likely use up its stores of oil in a matter of weeks to days if China implemented a blockade, according to a report by DW.

Therefore, nuclear power would give Taipei an additional energy storage solution.

""Nuclear power does, in my view, change that calculus, providing a lot of continuity under coercion, and I think it really complicates Beijing's playbook,"" Singleton argued.

Ultimately, he said that Taiwan needs to better diversify its energy needs in order to better protect against a potential Chinese blockade.

""The U.S. needs to help Taiwan diversify fast, cut exposure to vulnerable suppliers like Qatar, and probably prepare for a contest of endurance because I think that's exactly how China is thinking about this issue,"" he added, noting Qatar’s relationship with China and its large number of LNG exports to Bejing.

In an era of escalating energy demands, solar and wind power are demonstrating remarkable resilience, even as federal subsidies face potential rollbacks. According to a recent analysis in The Wall Street Journal, the surge in electricity needs—driven partly by data centers powering artificial intelligence—has created a fertile ground for renewables to compete on their own merits. Costs for these technologies have plummeted over the past decade, making them increasingly viable without government incentives. Industry experts note that while subsidies like those from the Inflation Reduction Act have accelerated deployment, the underlying economics now favor solar and wind in many markets.

This shift is underscored by rising wholesale electricity prices, which bolster the case for renewables. For instance, natural gas prices have spiked due to supply constraints, pushing utilities toward cheaper alternatives. Analysts project that by 2025, renewables could overtake coal as the dominant global electricity source, a milestone highlighted in reports from the International Energy Agency.

Demand Surge from Tech Innovations

The AI boom is a key catalyst. Data centers, which consume vast amounts of power, are turning to renewables for stable, low-cost energy. Hindustan Times reports that this demand, combined with the escalating costs of fossil fuels, cushions the impact of subsidy reductions. In the U.S., where policy changes under the Trump administration aim to tighten tax credits, as detailed in Reuters, renewables are still advancing. Projects are securing power purchase agreements at competitive rates, often below those of gas-fired plants.

Moreover, global trends support this trajectory. A United Nations assessment, covered in The Times of India, indicates that solar and wind have reached a tipping point, with costs dropping to levels that outpace traditional sources. This is evident in auctions where unsubsidized bids for solar projects in regions like the Middle East come in under 2 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Cost Competitiveness and Market Dynamics

Even without subsidies, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) metrics show renewables holding their own. A 2021 report from Renewable Energy World affirmed that solar and onshore wind remain competitive with gas, nuclear, and coal. Updated data from Lazard’s 2025 LCOE analysis, referenced in posts on X, pegs utility-scale solar at $26-40 per megawatt-hour, undercutting natural gas at $37-50. This cost edge is driving installations, with wind and solar projected to supply 33% of global energy by 2030, per industry roadmaps shared on social platforms.

However, challenges persist. Critics, including those in FactCheck.org, debate whether wind truly “works” without aid, pointing to variability and grid integration costs. Yet, advancements in battery storage are mitigating intermittency, enabling renewables to provide reliable power.

Policy Implications and Long-Term Strength

Recent policy moves, such as the executive order seeking to end wind and solar subsidies reported by Reuters, could initially slow growth. Business Report suggests installations might dip 23% short-term, but the sector could emerge stronger, weaned off incentives and focused on efficiency. U.S. Energy Secretary’s call to eliminate all energy subsidies, as discussed in CleanTechnica, echoes this sentiment, advocating a level playing field.

Internationally, the story is similar. In the UK, guidance for renewable auctions shows offshore wind contracts at around £117 per megawatt-hour, competitive with wholesale prices, according to posts on X from energy analysts. This reflects a broader decoupling from subsidies, with solar photovoltaic costs falling 80% since 2010.

Innovation and Future Projections

Technological innovations are accelerating this independence. Microinverters and energy storage systems, highlighted in X discussions on companies like Enphase and Tesla, enhance efficiency and grid stability. The Institute for Energy Research notes in a recent piece that while the Inflation Reduction Act provided uncapped benefits, market forces are now dominant.

Looking ahead, experts predict renewables will cover nearly all global demand growth in 2024-2025, per IEA analyses shared on X. By 2028, solar is expected to surpass wind, overtaking nuclear earlier. This evolution positions solar and wind not just as subsidized alternatives, but as core components of a cost-effective energy mix, resilient to policy fluctuations and poised for sustained expansion.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-2ead61b8-b2e8-4e11-9ad5-6f84ef748fa0.jpeg,N,,2025-08-23 11:01:53.312093

There’s no shortage of sunlight in the Lone Star State — which is leading the nation in renewable energy production.
Miggins says the state’s power grid needs all energy sources working together to keep up with demand.
“We need as much energy as we can get in Texas,” Miggins said.
“There’s a lot of manufacturing that’s comes to Texas around renewable energy,” Miggins said.","TEXAS — In Texas, we need all the power we can create to keep up with demand. But developing wind and solar projects could get more difficult for power generators across the country.

There’s no shortage of sunlight in the Lone Star State — which is leading the nation in renewable energy production.

“If you look at all the growth that is happening in Texas, our energy needs are growing faster than ever — not just with population growth, but particularly with data centers,” Big Sun Solar CEO Robert Miggins said.

Miggins says the state’s power grid needs all energy sources working together to keep up with demand.

“We need as much energy as we can get in Texas,” Miggins said. “We need oil and gas. We need coal. We need nuclear. And we definitely need wind and solar. Now I think is not a great time to for us to find ways to reduce the amount of energy we can put on the grid.”

In July, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ending tax incentives for power generators investing in clean renewable energy.

“We are going to see pretty significant rollbacks in new investments in wind and solar projects,” said Dr. Taylor Collins, an energy economics professor at the University of the Incarnate Word. “The good news is it really shouldn’t have too much influence on projects that are already in place. It shouldn’t roll back any currently existing infrastructure.”

Collins says that while this act could make an easier path for natural gas production, keeping up with increasing demands will become more difficult without a mix of energy sources.

“Basically, these wind and solar projects have until July 4, 2026, to start construction in order to remain eligible for the investment tax credits,” Collins said. “Which means for the next year or so, we really won’t see too much of a hit to the Texas economy.”

Even with tax breaks disappearing, CPS Energy’s CEO Rudy Garza says they will continue investing in solar and battery storage — because the community needs it, no matter the cost.

“When you decide to start taking, arbitrarily taking resources off the table, it doesn’t mean they’re going to go away,” said Garza. “It means customers are going to pay more for them.”

The electricity demand in the United States is expected to increase by 16% in the next five years. Miggins fears this legislation may push companies to build data centers outside of the U.S., which could be a security risk.

“There’s a lot of manufacturing that’s comes to Texas around renewable energy,” Miggins said. “I think a lot of these jobs are at risk.”

In the short term, Collins says the economy may see a boost as power generators push through projects before the tax credit ends, but customers won’t feel the economic effects until 2026 or 2027.

“A lot of projects that likely would have taken place might not occur anymore,” Collins said. “That’s a big loss in investment. A loss in investment comes with a loss of jobs that could potentially hit some of our GDP.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/solar-3,N,,2025-08-23 10:00:06.416008

Many experts are punting this move as the primary factor in what will finally elevate electric vehicles into the position of the new mainstream option for personal mobility. Modern lithium-ion technology has taken the industry very far in recent years, having more than doubled EPA-estimated range capabilities compared to older EVs using simpler chemistries.

While the mainstream electric car industry is relatively young, the history of electrified vehicles stretches past well over 100 years. In the early 1900s, electric cars stood as serious contenders to steam and gasoline vehicles, offering quiet operation, easy starting, and zero emissions at a time when internal combustion engines were noisy and required hand cranking. These cars used lead-acid batteries and were marketed for their cleanliness and reliability, but limited range, slower speeds, and improving gasoline infrastructure eventually pushed them out of the mainstream by the 1920s, despite their technological elegance and ease of use. Veritasium tells us about some engineers who applied lithium chemistries to their battery packs and highlights why this was such a problematic route to take in the early years of energy storage solutions.

To give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturers and other authoritative sources, including Veritasium, Hyman, RM Sotheby's, and Interesting Engineering.

The Dramatic Introduction Of Lithium In Early EVs

Initial Adoption Was Way Ahead Of Its Time

The goal of Veritasium's video is to highlight how engineers struggled with applying lithium-metal battery packs

to early examples of electric vehicles, due to their high energy, resulting in extreme reactivity. Lithium reacts with standard liquid electrolytes, causing dendrite formation. These are tiny, tree-like lithium structures that develop from the source of the material as it becomes more unstable, resulting in puncture separators, spark shorts, and resultant fire risks. The video also shows us how chemistry and materials science finally got control over that behavior by modifying the electrode architecture. This introduces the nano-structured scaffold design with protective coatings, or three-dimensional frameworks, which help distribute charge evenly, thus drastically reducing stress points and thermal runaway risk.

This breakthrough centers on replacing or reformulating traditional liquid electrolytes. Researchers use advanced ceramic, polymer, and composite solid electrolytes that suppress dendrite growth while maintaining ion transport speed. Visuals depicted in the research-based video demonstrate how the battery now survives nail-puncture tests and high-temperature exposure without igniting. These tests highlight how stabilized lithium metal can finally behave safely under extreme conditions, representing a breakthrough shift in modern battery design. In today's manufacturing climate, electric vehicle battery packs have shrunk in size, while bringing longer range and faster charging, resulting in better consumer confidence.

The Genius Of Solid Electrolytes

Solid electrolytes replace flammable liquid electrolytes with ceramic, polymer, or composite materials that conduct lithium ions while physically blocking dendrite penetration. Ceramics like garnet-type oxides offer high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, while polymers improve flexibility and make for a simpler manufacturing process. Some designs layer multiple materials to combine advantages.

Electrodes use nano-structured scaffolds, which are tiny and precisely engineered frameworks that spread lithium deposition evenly across the surface, preventing the aforementioned hotspots that trigger dendrite growth. Materials like carbon nanofibers or porous metal foams create more uniform current density during charging.

Ultra-thin films of stable compounds coat the lithium metal surface. These act as artificial solid-electrolyte interphases, reducing unwanted side reactions with the electrolyte and enhancing cycling stability. Nail penetration, crush, and thermal exposure tests measure resistance to short-circuits and fires.

The First Examples Of EVs Were Interesting

And Surprisingly Successful Considering Their Flaws

Some of the earliest examples of electric vehicles include the Columbia Runabout, produced by the Electric Vehicle Company in 1901. This was capable of reaching a 15-MPH top speed while covering 40 miles of range on a single charge. The Baker Electric Model V from Ohio’s Baker Motor Vehicle Company became a status symbol for wealthy urban drivers, including Clara Ford, the wife of Henry Ford. Detroit Electric also built some of the most successful early EVs, achieving ranges of over 80 miles per charge and catering to doctors, socialites, and city professionals.

Bear in mind that all of these models featured lead-acid batteries, which are terrible at maintaining capacity between charging cycles, ultimately causing gasoline vehicles to rapidly take over as the mainstream fueling method due to their much more practical usability, longevity, and better performance. After just 500 charge cycles, the battery pack would have lost half of its capacity, making early EV adoption a truly impossible task, as they would need full battery pack replacements at least every two years.

The GM EV1's Progressive Battery Technology

It Wasn't The Best, But It Showed A Dramatic Improvement

Early adoption of electrified vehicles in the U.S. started with the cool but rather controversial GM EV1. This compact electric coupe was intended to fill a very niche spot in the new vehicle market, but the project was ultimately scrapped due to a lack of mass market feasibility, leading to all but one test unit being scrapped and crushed. The very first iteration of the EV1 featured a 16.5-kWh lead acid battery pack, which was enough to carry the peculiar EV for a full 55 miles before running out of juice. Towards the end of its development cycle, GM finally managed to get a 26.4-kWh nickel-metal hydride battery pack into the chassis, increasing its mileage claim to a much more impressive 142 miles.

GM EV1 Performance Specifications

The GM EV1's drivetrain consisted of a single three-phase alternating current induction motor with an IGBT power inverter. This sounds like a fancy and technical configuration, but it was only enough to twist out 137 horsepower and 110 pound-feet, resulting in an eight-second 0-60 MPH time and 80 MPH top speed. GM approached Delco Electronics for the Magne Charge inductive charging paddle, which would take anywhere between six and eight hours to replenish the battery pack, depending on the output. While the GM EV1 was a considerable failure for the brand, we can't deny that it was a considerable stepping stone, the fruits of which it got to experience a couple of decades later.

The Current Progress Of Solid-State Battery Technology

Over the last year or so, a lot of manufacturers have been investing heavily in getting solid-state battery technology ready for the new electric car market. This has been an uphill battle for many brands, but most have promised that the first production-ready examples will be launched globally by the end of the decade. At the moment, the Hyundai Group appears to be the front-runner of the development program, but Mercedes-Benz isn't too far behind, as it already has a working prototype that's been tested by some reviewers. Toyota has also been very vocal about getting solid-state battery technology right before opting to make the switch to a fully electrified catalog.

On the sidelines, a lot of power source developers have been investing a great deal of time and resources into alternative energy storage chemistries. Lithium batteries are currently the leading technology for almost every electric vehicle manufacturer in the industry today, but it is an ultimately flawed model, because it requires heavy and invasive mining practices to secure the necessary amount of rare earth materials. It also aggressively fuels the ongoing humanitarian crisis of modern slavery in the Congo, where many are being forced to work in grueling conditions for little to no pay, all through the means of gathering the material at a low cost to the manufacturer. Solid state and lithium sulfur programs at Toyota, QuantumScape, and Mercedes all bank on lithium metal, yet most companies are still fighting runaway dendrites that pierce solid electrolytes and cause thermal runaway.

Viable Solutions Are Being Discovered Across The Globe

There's also a South Korean team at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology that has developed a printing method that stabilizes ultrathin lithium‑metal anodes and more than doubles their lifespan compared to conventional lithium‑ion cells. The team focused on the dendrite formation by applying a protective layer via printing technology.

The dendrite formation is what impacts the chemistry's safety and cycle life over time and with use. In pouch‑cell tests, the protected lithium‑metal anodes maintained 81.5 percent of their original capacity after 100 percent charging and discharge cycles and achieved a Coulombic efficiency of 99.1 percent. The Coulombic efficiency in batteries refers to the ratio of charge extracted during discharge to the charge inserted during charging. This represents more than double the stability of unprotected lithium cells. Even under extreme conditions via charging and discharging in just nine minutes, the cells retained 74.1 percent capacity, showing exceptional resilience under rapid and high‑rate usage.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/the-first-evs-were-doomed-by-batteries-that-aged-like-bananas.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 11:01:38.851537

Even as the federal government moves to roll back and delay air pollution protections, states still have the option to implement their own stricter regulations, including more stringent permitting requirements and pollution control rules, said Buonocore.
“Power plants, any of those kinds of things, these are things that the state has some say over ….,” he said.
The industry impacted health in cities with little or no oil and gas activity, including Washington, DC, New York City and Chicago, according to the study.","Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI).

Air pollution from oil and gas activities is responsible for an estimated 91,000 deaths and over 10,000 preterm births in the US each year, according to a new study that examined the impacts of the industry through its lifecycle from extraction to refining to burning fuel in power plants.

The study, published August 22 in the journal Science Advances, also attributes an estimated 216,000 annual incidences of US childhood asthma to air pollutants from fossil fuels, as well as over 1,600 lifetime cancers.

California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have the highest total health burden from all stages of oil and gas production and use, according to the study, with racial minorities facing disproportionate exposure to harmful air pollutants that include fine particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide.

The findings, based on data from 2017, likely underestimate the health toll of the US oil and gas lifecycle, the authors said, given annual production increased by 40% from 2017 to 2023 and consumption increased by about 8%.

“Every day, new peer-reviewed evidence emerges demonstrating the level of harm the petrochemical industry causes,” Heather McTeer Toney, executive director of the nonprofit Beyond Petrochemicals, said in a statement. “Faced with this data, I can’t imagine how a government official at any level could support building more petrochemical plants.”

Previous studies have focused on air pollution from a single stage of the oil and gas lifecycle, a single air pollutant, or a specific region, according to the study authors.

To measure the industry’s national health impact, the researchers combined data from several sources, from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s National Emission Inventory. The new study is “a solid leap forward” in its effort to determine the industry’s broader health impacts, said Johnathan Buonocore, an air pollution researcher at Boston University. “This paper shows there’s impacts across that whole supply chain that we all should be paying attention to,” he said.

The findings come after the Trump administration launched what the US EPA in March called the “biggest deregulatory action in US history,” with a particular focus on easing regulations “throttling the oil and gas industry.”

Last month, the administration announced plans to rescind the government’s “endangerment finding,” which forms the basis for enforcing limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The administration issued a rule that extends by 18 months deadlines for fossil fuel operations to reduce their emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds.

The Environmental Defense Fund, the Center for Biological Diversity and other nonprofits this week filed a motion asking a federal court to stop the move to delay these limits on pollution from oil and gas operations.

“Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for its pollution, the Trump administration is forcing people to breathe dangerous chemicals and suffer the harms of an overheating climate,” Maggie Coulter, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, said in a statement.

Even as the federal government moves to roll back and delay air pollution protections, states still have the option to implement their own stricter regulations, including more stringent permitting requirements and pollution control rules, said Buonocore.

“Power plants, any of those kinds of things, these are things that the state has some say over ….,” he said. “States have the ability to set their own regulations that go above and beyond the federal floor.”

Buonocore and colleagues concluded in a 2023 study that oil and gas production is responsible for $77 billion in annual health costs – about three times the cost of climate impacts from the industry’s methane emissions. The industry impacted health in cities with little or no oil and gas activity, including Washington, DC, New York City and Chicago, according to the study.

Battery energy storage systems are becoming a vital part of our nation’s energy infrastructure.
Even in the rare event of a fire, battery energy storage systems are designed with layers of safeguards to keep it contained.
Those same lessons about readiness, accountability, and public trust, all apply today as battery energy storage expands across New York.
Our message is simple: under New York’s standards and fire code, battery energy storage systems are safe.","During my time as head of hazmat operations for the New York City Fire Department, I learned that New Yorkers expect one thing above all else: to know their safety is never compromised. That principle guided every decision I made at the FDNY, and it should continue to guide how we evaluate new technologies today.

New York’s recently adopted fire code updates for battery energy storage systems (BESS) do exactly that. These standards are among the strongest in the country, built on years of safety testing, collaboration, and the expertise of experienced fire professionals. They prove that when it comes to public safety, New York doesn’t cut corners.

Battery energy storage systems are becoming a vital part of our nation’s energy infrastructure. They help stabilize the grid, reduce costs, and keep the lights on during periods of high demand. Like any technology, they must be held to the highest safety standards — and in New York, they are.

Even in the rare event of a fire, battery energy storage systems are designed with layers of safeguards to keep it contained. New York’s fire code requires each battery unit to be housed in its own compartment, preventing flames from spreading. Before these systems are ever installed, the code requires manufacturers to subject them to extensive fire testing.

If an incident occurs, the system is automatically taken offline, trained firefighters respond, and independent experts are brought in to investigate the cause and assess impacts.

To date, no battery energy storage fire in New York has ever spread beyond a facility’s perimeter, nor has one caused injury or environmental harm to the surrounding air, soil, or water. That record is not chance — it reflects rigorous codes, continuous monitoring, and proactive training.

Modern systems go even further. Today’s projects in New York are purpose-built with safety designed into every corner of the system. These projects are monitored 24/7/365 with sophisticated detection systems that atomically turn components off if they are malfunctioning. This also allows operators to turn portions of the system or the entire system off if something isn’t operating correctly.

Fires at these facilities are extremely rare. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, BESS fire cases have dropped by 98% from 2018 to 2024, despite a 25,000% increase in battery energy storage systems during that time. By comparison, electrical failure or equipment malfunctions in commercial buildings were attributed to 12,600 fires in 2022 alone. In that same year, there were six reported BESS events.

In any response, firefighters rely on training, planning, and coordination in the face of potential unimaginable circumstances. Those same lessons about readiness, accountability, and public trust, all apply today as battery energy storage expands across New York. The priority must always be to anticipate risks and put protections in place well in advance.

That is exactly what New York is doing. The state’s code builds on and strengthens one of the nation’s most comprehensive fire codes for energy storage, establishing some of the most robust requirements anywhere in the country.

The latest updates go further by requiring Emergency Response Plans to be developed with local fire departments, mandating firefighter training, and ensuring independent third-party technical reviews. These safeguards guarantee that firefighters have the tools and information they need before a system is built, and that every project undergoes a thorough, impartial review.

New York’s fire code now exceeds even recent EPA recommendations. In addition, every BESS site in New York is required to provide fire departments with a direct phone line to trained experts for immediate support, even though EPA boss Lee Zeldin is raising doubts.

That is why fire safety experts and former fire officials, including myself, issued a Fire Safety Declaration last month. Our message is simple: under New York’s standards and fire code, battery energy storage systems are safe.

Trust grows from transparency, honest engagement with the public, and ongoing training for fire departments as these systems expand. Safety is never a finished job; it is a continuing responsibility. For New Yorkers, the takeaway should be clear: these systems are being carefully reviewed before being installed, the codes are rigorous, and safeguards are firmly in place.

I can say after more than three decades as a firefighter: I stand by these updated codes and the process that produced them. New York has once again set the standard for putting public safety first, and communities across the state will be safer because of it.

Overview of Tax Credits for Cars in 2025

Tax credits for vehicles in 2025 come in several forms designed to promote cleaner transportation and support American manufacturing. The two most notable are the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit and the newly reinstated auto loan interest deduction under the Big Beautiful Bill. Both aim to make owning a new vehicle more affordable, particularly for Chicago-area families balancing urban commutes and weekend getaways.

The EV tax credit provides up to $7,500 for qualifying new electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Vehicles must meet specific assembly and battery sourcing criteria, with price caps generally set at $80,000 for SUVs and trucks, and $55,000 for sedans. This incentive is particularly relevant for buyers in neighborhoods like University Village and Mid-North District who prioritize sustainability and cost savings.

Complementing this is the auto loan interest deduction introduced by the Big Beautiful Bill, effective for new vehicle loans starting in 2025. It allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in auto loan interest paid, benefiting those financing their purchase. Importantly, this deduction applies only to vehicles assembled in the United States, aligning with Chevrolet’s commitment to American manufacturing.

Specific income limitations also apply: single filers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) up to $100,000 and joint filers up to $200,000 qualify for the deduction, with gradual phase-outs above these thresholds.

For Chicago families in areas like Maplewood or Wrightwood Neighbors, understanding these credits can translate into real savings on reliable Chevrolet SUVs and trucks built for both city streets and suburban roads.

What Cars Qualify Under the Big Beautiful Bill?

The Big Beautiful Bill reintroduces a valuable tax deduction for auto loan interest, targeting new vehicle purchasers who finance their cars. This provision specifically excludes leased vehicles and used cars, focusing exclusively on new vehicles with final assembly in the United States.

Eligible vehicles include:

Cars, minivans, SUVs, pickup trucks, and motorcycles with a gross vehicle weight rating under 14,000 pounds.

Vehicles intended strictly for personal use, excluding commercial or business applications.

This means Chevrolet’s latest models, including the Equinox and Silverado EVs assembled domestically, are prime candidates for the deduction, offering Chicago-area customers an added financial benefit beyond the vehicle’s performance and features.

Financing must commence after December 31, 2024, ensuring that loan interest paid during 2025 to 2028 qualifies for the deduction. Importantly, if you refinance a qualifying vehicle, the interest on the refinanced loan may also be deductible, provided the vehicle was originally new and personally owned.

While the maximum deduction is $10,000 annually, experts note that average buyers may see smaller savings due to typical loan sizes and interest accrual. For example, a typical new Chevrolet financed at local Chicago dealerships might realize a deduction translating to several hundred dollars in tax savings, which still contributes meaningful relief given current vehicle prices.

Residents of Chicago’s South Loop and East Village can take advantage of this deduction when choosing Chevrolet models known for their American craftsmanship, blending performance with tax-smart purchasing.

Which Vehicles Qualify for the Auto Loan Interest Tax Credit?

To benefit from the auto loan interest deduction, both the vehicle and financing must meet precise conditions:

The vehicle must be new, purchased with a loan starting on or after January 1, 2025.

Final assembly must occur within the United States; buyers can verify this via the vehicle’s window sticker or VIN.

The vehicle type must be a car, SUV, minivan, pickup truck, or motorcycle weighing less than 14,000 pounds.

It must be used for personal purposes only; commercial or business vehicles are excluded.

Leases are not eligible for this deduction.

Refinancing is allowed but only if the vehicle was originally purchased new and owned personally.

These criteria underscore the benefits of choosing Chevrolet vehicles, many of which are assembled domestically and designed with Chicago’s urban and suburban driving in mind. For instance, the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Equinox EV models meet these assembly and weight requirements, making them ideal candidates for buyers in neighborhoods such as Ducktown.

The deduction phases out for taxpayers exceeding income limits, so prospective buyers should consult with a tax professional to assess their eligibility based on household income and loan details.

IRS Car Allowance and Mileage Rates for 2025

For individuals using their vehicles for business, charitable, medical, or moving purposes, the IRS standard mileage rates provide a method to calculate deductible expenses related to car use.

The 2025 mileage rates are:

Business use (including self-employed): 70 cents per mile

Charitable activities: 14 cents per mile

Medical or moving purposes (military only): 21 cents per mile

These rates have increased slightly from previous years, reflecting rising fuel and maintenance costs. Commuters and business owners in Chicago’s Forestville and Mid-North District can use these rates to maximize deductions related to vehicle use on tax filings.

Understanding these rates is essential for those who might not qualify for direct tax credits but still want to reduce taxable income through mileage deductions, especially when operating Chevrolet trucks or SUVs that are well-suited for heavier-duty or versatile driving needs.

Vehicles Eligible for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit

The $7,500 federal tax credit remains a significant incentive for buyers of qualifying electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chevrolet leads with several models that qualify for this credit in 2025, benefiting Chicago drivers seeking a dependable, American-made EV or PHEV.

Some Chevrolet models eligible for the full $7,500 credit include:

Chevrolet Equinox EV (2024-2026, LT and RS models) with an MSRP cap of $80,000

Chevrolet Silverado EV (2025-2026, LT model), also capped at $80,000

Chevrolet Blazer EV (2024-2026 models) fitting within the same price limit

Other notable vehicles qualifying for the credit include the Ford F-150 Lightning EV and Chrysler Pacifica PHEV, but Chevrolet’s offerings stand out for their combination of American assembly, advanced connectivity, and family-friendly features.

Buyers in Chicago’s University Village and Wrightwood Neighbors will find these vehicles well-suited for both city driving and weekend excursions.

It’s important to check the specific VIN of the vehicle to confirm eligibility, as assembly location and battery sourcing affect qualification. The Department of Energy’s VIN check tool is a valuable resource for this verification.

Does a Toyota Plug-in Hybrid Qualify for Federal Tax Credits?

Toyota’s plug-in hybrid models have historically qualified for federal tax credits; however, recent changes to EV tax credit legislation have introduced stricter battery sourcing and assembly requirements.

While many Toyota plug-in hybrids meet the criteria for federal tax incentives, buyers should verify:

Whether the vehicle was assembled in North America

Compliance with specific battery component and critical mineral sourcing rules

MSRP limits (typically capped at $80,000 for SUVs and trucks)

Compared to Chevrolet’s plug-in hybrids and EVs, Toyota models may have different eligibility statuses depending on assembly location and battery composition.

“The tempo of activity on the production floor was positive with large materials handling orders in fulfillment, plus substantial electrolyzer activity and a GenSure project for a rail customer,” Irwin said. “We think investors under-appreciate the importance of the three elephant-sized electrolyzer projects Plug is pursuing, as just one would load production for a few years and support +EBITDA. Gross margins and cash flow are probably tracking well towards recent targets.”

Roth hosted the tour and met with chief executive officer Andy Marsh and chief financial officer Paul Middleton. Irwin said Plug’s materials handling business appears to be rebounding on improved funding visibility from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s 48E clean energy credit. Updated 48E terms allow the full 30% investment tax credit for qualified fuel-cell property that begins construction between 2026 and 2032. “We saw a couple of large materials handling orders in process of fulfillment on the production floor, giving confidence to our thesis. Electrolyzer and GenSure activity also seems to be benefiting,” he said.

Plug Power, headquartered in Latham, N.Y., designs and manufactures hydrogen fuel-cell systems used in forklifts and other equipment across large manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America.

Irwin pointed to the scale of three major electrolyzer projects, in Spain, Finland, and Australia, as potentially transformative.

“The 3GW Allied Green Ammonia project in Australia aims for committed financing later this year, which would present a major catalyst,” he said. “On the 2Q25 call, management confirmed the electrolyzer pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic the company could announce Cape Buffalo-sized agreements in 2H25.”

He also noted engagement from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which continues to work with Plug despite cancelling many other facilities.

“Greg Beard, who assumed the leadership role at LPO in May, spent a decade at Apollo and has about 30 years’ experience in energy investment,” Irwin said. “We believe management is intently focused on cementing an external equity partnership for the Texas electrolyzer and satisfying updated disbursement conditions/terms with DOE.”

Cash flow could also improve in the second half of 2025, he said, with benefits from power purchase agreement recovery, inventory liquidation, credit sales, and positive margins on multiple projects. Plug ended the second quarter with US$140-million in unrestricted cash and US$876-million in total cash. Cash burn of US$230-million compared with US$146-million in Q4 2024 and US$356-million in Q2 2024. The company expects restructuring efforts to yield substantial progress by year-end 2025.

Irwin expects Plug Power to post 2025 Adjusted EBITDA of negative US$400.0-million on revenue of US$733.9-million, versus his prior forecast of negative US$350.0-million and US$700.0-million, respectively. For 2026, he sees improvement to negative US$215.0-million on revenue of US$850.0-million

“I like working, and I love tough problems, and I've never met a harder problem than farming,” Belk said.
For many farmers in the Carolinas, like Belk, it's all in a day's work.
At Wild Hope Farm they grow in succession, so the next round of crops will hopefully be healthier, but handling the impacts of weather can be difficult.
Last year with Helene, Wild Hope Farm lost about 80% of its fall crops.","CHESTER, S.C. — Katherine Belk started farming in 2017. The owner of Wild Hope Farm said she thinks about the weather all the time.

“I like working, and I love tough problems, and I've never met a harder problem than farming,” Belk said.

This year those problems include the high temperatures in July and heavy rain in August.

For many farmers in the Carolinas, like Belk, it's all in a day's work.

“Because of the kind of variability in weather these days, we’ve invested heavily in the high tunnels. These allow us to grow year-round,” Belk said.

Growing inside high tunnels usually protects plants but can cause issues with runoff when it consistently rains.

“We’re trying to prevent erosion, so right now what we’re trying to do is laying some drainage pipes on either end of the high tunnel,” Belk said.

The last several weeks produced several inches of rain, which damages uncovered crops.

“You can see clearly that this bed is eroding. You can see where the water, the heavy rains, where the soil was moved from the bed,” Belk said.

At Wild Hope Farm they grow in succession, so the next round of crops will hopefully be healthier, but handling the impacts of weather can be difficult.

“Incredibly frustrating,” Belk said. “I woke up at 4, just stressed about the weather. The fact that we’re going to be like two weeks behind on our fall plantings.”

Tough weather conditions even impact the distribution side of farming. Belk sells at farmers markets, community-supported agriculture and wholesale.

“When our crops are suffering, we have fewer yields, lower yields, and it means that we make less money from whole-selling,” Belk said.

That’s why she says it’s crucial to support local farmers and even restaurants that sell locally grown food.

“It is just really, really challenging to grow, to farm in today’s weather climate and so we need all of the support we can get, and it really does make all the difference to have the community at your back,” Belk said.

She said to support farmers, go to farmer's markets. Buy local produce, eggs and meat.

This time of year, with hurricane season, conditions for farmers can be unpredictable. Last year with Helene, Wild Hope Farm lost about 80% of its fall crops.

Belk said there’s not much you can do to prepare for weather like a hurricane, so the farm is hoping for the best this hurricane season.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/View_recent_photos-35,N,,2025-08-23 15:02:30.439523

Range anxiety is one of the biggest ‘pitfalls’ of EVs, with many customers holding back on buying an electric car due to fears of running out of battery.

Companies around the world are looking for a solution, and a Chinese team might have come up with the answer.

Its new battery has twice the range of the Tesla advanced 4860 cell, and could eliminate range fears once and for all.

How much range does the battery have?

Currently, a pilot production line has been set up for the new EV battery.

The team behind it is from Tianjin University, and they say it has 660 watt-hours per kilogram of energy density.

For context, the Tesla 4680 battery has 300 watt-hours per kilogram of density.

Even more interesting is that BYD’s Blade Battery has an energy density of just 150 watt-hours per kilogram.

In terms of mileage, the team behind it has not yet released any figures.

For context, in the base Model Y standard range, the 4680 battery packs have 311 miles of range.

But in longer-range models, it approaches the 400-mile mark.

If we crudely say double the density is double the range, the Chinese battery could last for up to 800 miles in some cases.

How bad is range anxiety?

Range anxiety has been a problem with electric cars for some time.

It stems from a fear of running out of battery on the road, without an EV charger being nearby.

As electric vehicle charging points become more common, though, that will become a thing of the past.

In fact, it then becomes no different from wanting to find a gas station for an ICE car.

But it is still something that holds many people back from buying an electric car.

Should this battery be put into production, it could double or quadruple the range of many EVs.

An electric car of 600 miles or more would shatter any fears of range anxiety and eliminate it altogether.

,Detroit Environment,2025-08-23 11:02:41+00:00,The Christian Science Monitor,"Ford is a bellwether: Electric vehicles are coming, despite Trump policy shifts","Eric C. Evarts, The Christian Science Monitor",,,,,https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2025/0823/ford-trump-electric-vehicles-china,"Pioneer of assembly lines, Ford aims to innovate again To make EVs affordable, Ford envisions a massive overhaul of the production process.
We knew that the Chinese would be the major player [in global EV competition.]
And the biggest drop in sales came from Tesla, which alone accounts for 46% of the U.S. EV market.
“The global EV environment is facing increasing domination from Chinese automakers,” says Mr. Brauer of iSeeCars.com.
Now, U.S. automakers “are adapting, shifting products around,” says Mr. Abuelsamid.","President Donald Trump has positioned himself as a defender of gas cars, and a foe of any mandate to phase them out. But his U-turn on federal policy doesn’t spell the end of an electric revolution in Detroit, which has invested decades and hundreds of billions of dollars in developing electric vehicles, batteries, and their supply chains.

An announcement last week by Ford marks the most definitive statement yet by an American automaker that it is committed to the future of electric cars, no matter what happens in Washington.

CEO Jim Farley said the company will invest $5 billion in an all-new modular EV platform and assembly process that will make it easier and cheaper to produce electric models in the United States. The company also announced the first product to be built with this system: a small electric pickup set to debut in 2027 for under $30,000.

The announcement, at a union factory in Louisville, Kentucky, reflected what many in the auto industry say is an increasingly clear reality: Electric transportation – and the technology to produce it more affordably – is barreling ahead, regardless of American politics or culture. And if U.S. automakers don’t want to fall behind, they need to figure out how to strike a delicate balance among shifting political demands in Washington, the evolving tastes of American car buyers, and global competition, especially from China.

“It’s so difficult to impress on people who are not watching the industry that the next step in the automobile will be electric,” says Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. “If you take your foot off the accelerator of EV development, China is not going to slow down. And once you lose the lead, you become an also-ran very quickly.”

Ford’s announcement demonstrates its dedication to not becoming one of those also-rans by staying in the global competition.

Soon after he took office, Mr. Trump instructed Congress to eliminate the $7,500 purchase rebates for American-made EVs, as well as fuel economy standards for car manufacturers that effectively required EV production in order to comply. The administration has also done away with the Environmental Protection Agency’s mandate to regulate carbon emissions and California’s waiver to set its own air quality standards that are stricter than the rest of the nation. It recently implemented a federal road tax just for EVs that is about twice what an average driver pays in federal gas taxes.

All of this has made the environment for EVs “far more challenging in the U.S. market this year,” says Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com.

Pioneer of assembly lines, Ford aims to innovate again

To make EVs affordable, Ford envisions a massive overhaul of the production process. Its plans, years in the making, developed out of view. A small, dedicated skunkworks of management engineers, poached from EV and tech firms such as Apple, Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, and Amazon, has been working in Long Beach, California, far from Ford’s Detroit-area headquarters.

“The automotive industry in America is at a crossroads about new technology and about new competition from everywhere,” Mr. Farley told the assembled autoworkers. “We saw this coming for years. We knew that the Chinese would be the major player [in global EV competition.] For too long, legacy automakers played it safe. We needed a radical approach. We need to do it and be sustainable and make money, and we need to do it with American workers.”

Ford called its plan a “Model T moment,” because it aims to bring back a kind of modular production system that will allow it to easily build a variety of body styles on a single production line. Instead of a single car moving down an assembly line with workers adding parts along the way, the line will have three branches, like rivers coming together at the end, with front, middle, and rear sections that can be mixed and matched to meet demand. So a single center cabin could get a sedan, hatchback, SUV, or pickup back end. With each portion built separately, workers will no longer have to reach through doors to install large parts like dashboards, making production much more efficient – and safer.

Despite the anti-EV rhetoric coming out of Washington, 10% more EVs were sold during the first quarter of 2025 – nearly 300,000 vehicles – than during the same time frame in 2024, according to Cox Automotive data. Sales dropped in the second quarter, to 6% below last year, but they were still higher in the first six months of 2025 than they were in 2024. And the biggest drop in sales came from Tesla, which alone accounts for 46% of the U.S. EV market.

At the time, Tesla had shut down its Model Y factory in Texas in preparation to build an updated model with a new assembly process similar to the one Ford announced last week. Many potential Tesla buyers and existing owners also balked at CEO Elon Musk’s actions at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), giving rise to bumper stickers proclaiming, “Bought before I knew Elon was crazy,” or “This is my last Tesla.”

Excluding Tesla, EV sales actually rose 4% in the first half of 2025 compared with last year.

“If this administration had its way, [American automakers] would stop production of anything electrified; they would only build big trucks and SUVs,” says Samuel Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at the Detroit-based consultancy Telemetry. But “People in Japan are never going to buy [Ford] F-150s, because they won’t fit on their tiny roads. Markets like Japan and Korea don’t buy U.S. products because we don’t build anything they can use.”

China drives a changing global marketplace

Ford’s investment shows that Detroit is motivated more by Chinese competition than by Washington politics, analysts say.

“The global EV environment is facing increasing domination from Chinese automakers,” says Mr. Brauer of iSeeCars.com. Chinese automakers have been gobbling up market share with EVs in Europe, where Ford and Stellantis have business worth tens of billions of dollars. EVs account for 49% of car sales in China, where Ford made $660 million last year, while business for both General Motors and Stellantis there has been faltering.

Now, U.S. automakers “are adapting, shifting products around,” says Mr. Abuelsamid. Going forward, legacy automakers will focus more on smaller, more affordable electric cars, such as the new small electric pickup that Ford announced, he says. GM is bringing back the affordable Chevrolet Bolt EV. And Hyundai and Kia have a raft of new smaller models in the wings. Legacy automakers have “realized they put too much emphasis on the high end of the market,” he says, in part trying to emulate Tesla’s success in selling $70,000 to $130,000 EVs.

“We’re committed to electrification,” says Marty Gunsberg, spokesperson for Ford Model e, in a statement to the Monitor. “We appreciate the administration’s work to align regulations with market realities, and we believe electric vehicles are a great customer solution. These are the vehicles that will go toe-to-toe with China. We ... think our investments speak for themselves.”

Cheaper batteries are also part of the effort to bring prices down. GM, Ford, and Tesla are transitioning to batteries using the lithium iron phosphate technology from power tools, which costs half as much as earlier EV technology that was akin to what’s used in laptop computers and cellphones.

If there is a change in the EV market at the moment, then, it’s less a pullback from electric cars than a reflection that previous forecasts were too optimistic, says Mr. Fiorani, the analyst in Pennsylvania.

“The problem in both the U.S. and Europe is that regulators pushed [automakers] to produce more [EVs] than the markets could bear,” he says. “The whole industry was under the misperception that this was going to be a relatively quick transition to EVs, and that just wasn’t going to be the case.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/08/0822%20NEVFUTURE%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-08-23 08:03:02.490829

According to the financial services major, lowering GST rates for conventional vehicles may make them more attractive in terms of upfront cost, which could slow the adoption of EVs that are still relatively expensive despite government incentives.

Currently, EVs attract a 5% GST rate, compared to 28% for ICE vehicles. Any reduction in the latter category could narrow the price gap, discouraging customers from transitioning to electric mobility. HSBC emphasised that such a move could undermine India’s broader goals of achieving carbon neutrality and boosting clean transportation.

The warning comes as the Indian government continues to weigh strategies to balance consumer affordability, industry competitiveness, and climate commitments.

The total cost of the project was $4 billion.

Ørsted announced in a press release:

Revolution Wind is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.

The project commenced offshore construction following the final federal approval from BOEM last year. The project is 80% complete with all offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously. This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.

Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits including its Construction and Operations Plan approval letter on 17 November 2023 following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, enough to power over 350,000 homes across both states to meet their growing energy demand. As a reference, South Fork Wind, which is adjacent to Revolution Wind and uses the same turbine technology, delivered reliable energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53% for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.

Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states. Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind.

Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings. Ørsted will, in due course, advise the market on the potential impact of the order on the plan announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement 12/2025) to conduct a rights issue. Existing shareholders and prospective investors are advised to await further announcements by the company.

But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels.
Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.
Ending Biden-era clean energy policies Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects, according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.
“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement.","If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you’re not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.

Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.

But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that’s being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation — all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, “When supply is scarce, then prices go up,” he said.

Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity — or 120 gigawatts — by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.

The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.

The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.

U.S. falling behind on transmission

Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there’s no shortage of fuel to add to the grid — it’s a shortage of transmission that’s the major problem.

At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.

To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.

“If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,” Gramlich said.

AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT’s Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.

“AI data centers are much more power intensive,” Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. “So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.”

Role of tariffs and equipment shortages

Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example — gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that’s holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.

“The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,” Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years — even as long as seven, according to a May analysis by S&P Global.

Energy sources

Over the past decade, the nation’s energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won’t be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.

“That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,” Gramlich told CBS News.

But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.

“If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,” Gramlich said.

Trump energy policies projected to raise prices

Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a “National Energy Emergency” executive order, arguing the country needs “reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.”

Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.

The passage of Trump’s signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.

OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O’Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.

O’Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, “The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar – subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,” said Ben Dietderich, the department’s press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.

Ending Biden-era clean energy policies

Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects, according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.

“Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, “The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.”

Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive

To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich’s firm, Grid Strategies.

“These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,” said Gramlich.

Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation’s electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.

If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates — 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 — the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.

According to the source, who requested anonymity because the plan has not been finalized, the Department of Energy (DOE) is expected to solicit proposals from industry within days.
The plan envisions offering the plutonium to companies at little or no cost.
A similar program to convert the material into mixed-oxide (MOX) reactor fuel collapsed in 2018 when the Trump administration terminated a costly project that was expected to exceed $50 billion.
“Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.","The Trump administration is preparing a plan to release roughly 20 metric tons of Cold War-era plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads for potential use as reactor fuel by U.S. power companies, according to a source familiar with the discussions and a draft policy memo obtained by Reuters.

While plutonium has previously been tested in commercial reactors only on a limited basis, the proposal would mark the first significant effort to integrate the material into the U.S. energy market.

The move stems from a directive signed by President Donald Trump in May, which instructed federal agencies to scale back a long-running program aimed at diluting and disposing of surplus plutonium, instead prioritising its use in advanced nuclear technologies.

According to the source, who requested anonymity because the plan has not been finalized, the Department of Energy (DOE) is expected to solicit proposals from industry within days. The source cautioned that key provisions could still change before a formal announcement.

The plan envisions offering the plutonium to companies at little or no cost. In return, utilities would assume full financial responsibility for transporting the material and building, operating, and eventually decommissioning government-approved facilities to process it into reactor-ready fuel.

The 20 metric tons represent a portion of a 34-metric-ton stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium that Washington pledged to eliminate under a 2000 non-proliferation agreement with Moscow. Specific details about the proposed allocation, industry responsibilities, and the timing of the rollout had not been previously disclosed.

The DOE, while not confirming the draft plan, said in a brief statement that it is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium,” in line with Trump’s directive.

The policy shift comes as the administration seeks to bolster the domestic energy sector, with electricity demand climbing for the first time in two decades due largely to the surge in data centers driven by artificial intelligence technologies.

Still, the idea of recycling surplus plutonium has drawn scepticism from nuclear safety experts. A similar program to convert the material into mixed-oxide (MOX) reactor fuel collapsed in 2018 when the Trump administration terminated a costly project that was expected to exceed $50 billion.

Currently, surplus plutonium is stored at high-security facilities such as the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the Pantex Plant in Texas, and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. With a half-life of 24,000 years, the material requires strict safety protocols and specialised equipment for handling.

Until Trump’s order in May, the U.S. disposal strategy involved blending the plutonium with inert materials and burying it at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), an underground repository in New Mexico—a process the DOE estimated would cost around $20 billion.

Critics argue the administration is repeating past mistakes. “Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It would entail trying to repeat the disastrous MOX fuel program and hoping for a different result. The excess plutonium is a dangerous waste product, and DOE should stick to the safer, more secure, and far cheaper plan to dilute and directly dispose of it in WIPP.”

“Because Donald Trump is in the White House again, it’s going to be up to mayors and governors to really enact and sustain the momentum around addressing climate change at the local level,” said Bibb, who formerly chaired Climate Mayors, a bipartisan group of nearly 350 mayors.
The biggest concern for Americans right now isn’t climate change, Bibb added.
Another is deploying electric vehicle chargers in underserved neighborhoods, as Cleveland is doing, and making their use free for residents.
But I think as mayors, we are well positioned to make that case at the local level.”","“This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.”

In the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, Justin Bibb was living in a tight, one-bedroom apartment in Cleveland, Ohio. He couldn’t open his windows because his home was an old office building converted to residential units — not exactly conducive to physical and mental well-being in the middle of a global crisis. So he sought refuge elsewhere: a large green space, down near the lakefront, that he could stroll to.

“Unfortunately,” Bibb said, “that’s not the case for many of our residents in the city of Cleveland.”

A native of Cleveland, Bibb was elected the 58th mayor of the city in 2021. Immediately after taking office, he took inspiration from the “15-minute city” concept of urban design, an idea that envisions people reaching their daily necessities — work, grocery stores, pharmacies — within 15 minutes by walking, biking, or taking public transit. That reduces dependence on cars, and also slashes carbon emissions and air pollution. In Cleveland, Bibb’s goal is to put all residents within a 10-minute walk of a green space by the year 2045, by converting abandoned lots to parks and other efforts.

Cleveland is far from alone in its quest to adapt to a warming climate. As American cities have grown in size and population and gotten hotter, they — not the federal government — have become crucibles for climate action: Cities are electrifying their public transportation, forcing builders to make structures more energy efficient, and encouraging rooftop solar. Together with ambitious state governments, hundreds of cities large and small are pursuing climate action plans — documents that lay out how they will reduce emissions and adapt to extreme weather — with or without support from the feds. Cleveland’s plan, for instance, calls for all its commercial and residential buildings to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

For local leaders, climate action has grown all the more urgent since the Trump administration has been boosting fossil fuels and threatening to sue states to roll back environmental regulations. Last week, Republicans in the House passed a budget bill that would end nearly all the clean energy tax credits from the Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. “Because Donald Trump is in the White House again, it’s going to be up to mayors and governors to really enact and sustain the momentum around addressing climate change at the local level,” said Bibb, who formerly chaired Climate Mayors, a bipartisan group of nearly 350 mayors.

City leaders can move much faster than federal agencies, and are more in-tune with what their people actually want, experts said. “They’re on the ground and they’re hearing from their residents every day, so they have a really good sense of what the priorities are,” said Kate Johnson, regional director for North America at C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 mayors fighting climate change. “You see climate action really grounded in the types of things that are going to help people.”

Shifting from a reliance on fossil fuels to clean energy isn’t just about reducing a city’s carbon emissions, but about creating jobs and saving money — a tangible argument that mayors can make to their people. Bibb said a pilot program in Cleveland that helped low- to moderate-income households get access to free solar panels ended up reducing their utility bills by 60 percent. The biggest concern for Americans right now isn’t climate change, Bibb added. “It’s the cost of living, and so we have to marry these two things together,” he said. “I think mayors are in a very unique position to do that.”

To further reduce costs and emissions, cities like Seattle and Washington, D.C. are scrambling to better insulate structures, especially affordable housing, by installing double-paned windows and better insulation. In Boston last year, the city government started an Equitable Emissions Investment Fund, which awards money for projects that make buildings more efficient or add solar panels to their roofs. “We are in a climate where energy efficiency remains the number one thing that we can do,” said Oliver Sellers-Garcia, commissioner of the environment and Green New Deal director in the Boston government. “And there are so many other comfort and health benefits from being in an efficient, all-electric environment.”

To that end, cities are deploying loads of heat pumps, hyper-efficient appliances that warm and cool a space. New York City, for instance, is spending $70 million to install 30,000 of the appliances in its public housing. The ultimate goal is to have as many heat pumps as possible running in energy-efficient homes — along with replacing gas stoves with induction ranges — and drawing electricity from renewables.

Metropolises like Los Angeles and Pittsburgh are creating new green spaces, which reduce urban temperatures and soak up rainwater to prevent flooding. A park is a prime example of “multisolving”: one intervention that fixes a bunch of problems at once. Another is deploying electric vehicle chargers in underserved neighborhoods, as Cleveland is doing, and making their use free for residents. This encourages the adoption of those vehicles, which reduces carbon emissions and air pollution. That, in turn, improves public health in those neighborhoods, which tend to have a higher burden of pollution than richer areas.

Elizabeth Sawin, director of the Multisolving Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, said that these efforts will be more important than ever as the Trump administration cuts funding for health programs. “If health care for poor children is going to be depleted — with, say, Medicaid under threat — cities can’t totally fix that,” Sawin said. “But if they can get cleaner air in cities, they can at least have fewer kids who are struggling from asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses.”

All this work — building parks, installing solar panels, weatherizing buildings — creates jobs, both within a city and in surrounding rural areas. Construction workers commute in, while urban farms tap rural growers for their expertise. And as a city gets more of its power from renewables, it can benefit counties far away: The largest solar facility east of the Mississippi River just came online in downstate Illinois, providing so much electricity to Chicago that the city’s 400 municipal buildings now run entirely on renewable power. “The economic benefits and the jobs aren’t just necessarily accruing to the cities — which might be seen as big blue cities,” Johnson said. “They’re buying their electric school buses from factories in West Virginia, and they’re building solar and wind projects in rural areas.”

So cities aren’t just preparing themselves for a warmer future, but helping accelerate a transition to renewables and spreading economic benefits across the American landscape. “We as elected officials have to do a better job of articulating how this important part of public policy is connected to the everyday lived experience,” Bibb said. “Unfortunately, my party has done a bad job of that. But I think as mayors, we are well positioned to make that case at the local level.”",https://dxu6k2kio89d8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/13131421/cleveland-metropark.webp,N,,2025-08-23 09:00:23.577860

The second, regional environmental justice law center Midwest Environmental Advocates, won a July case concerning Wisconsin public records law.
Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, but today still obtains three-quarters of its electricity from fossil fuels.
“We’ve argued that the fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts resulting from the approval of fossil fuel power plants is harming the plaintiff’s health, their homes, their property and their safety, and ultimately violating those constitutional rights to security and health,” Bellinger said.
Donald Trump’s policies have made youth climate action even more important, particularly at the state level, said Kaarina.","Fifteen young climate advocates, aged eight to 17, on Friday sued the state of Wisconsin over its pro-fossil fuel policies.

The case provides the opportunity for state officials to “make the correct step to decarbonize Wisconsin” because of the “climate harms they’ve caused youth”, said Kaarina, 17, who is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Kaarina grew up in the state’s Vernon county along the Mississippi River. But in 2023, a large boulder rolled into her backyard and knocked over trees.

Concerned for their safety, her family decided to relocate, but could not find an affordable home in the county that was safe from floods, which the climate crisis has made more common and severe. They were forced to move an hour north to La Crosse county.

Incidents like the one Kaarina experienced are occurring more frequently in Wisconsin, as winter thawing and subsequent refreezing cycles, known as “freeze-thaw events”, are increasing due to global heating. If it weren’t for the fossil fuel-driven climate crisis, Kaarina believes, her fate might have been different, as the boulder that tumbled toward her home would probably have never become dislodged.

“I had to move away from the childhood I planned to live in my entire life and enjoy with my own children,” said Kaarina, who is using only her first name because she is a minor.

The “incredibly traumatic and life-changing experience” helped inspire her to join the case, she said.

The new lawsuit was filed by two non-profit law firms. The first, Our Children’s Trust, notched a landmark 2023 win in a Montana case when a judge ruled that the state’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated young challengers’ state-given rights. The second, regional environmental justice law center Midwest Environmental Advocates, won a July case concerning Wisconsin public records law.

In the new lawsuit, plaintiffs are specifically targeting two Wisconsin laws governing the state’s public service commission, which regulates utilities. One prohibits the regulator from considering toxic and planet-heating air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel power plants, while another bars it from requiring utilities to increase the amount of electricity they obtain from carbon-free sources.

“These laws set up a system where the public service commission continues to approve fossil fuel power plants and cannot bring online more renewable energy,” said Nate Bellinger, supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust.

Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, but today still obtains three-quarters of its electricity from fossil fuels.

“The state legislature and the executive branch have both set goals and mandates to decarbonize the electricity sector,” said Bellinger. “These laws are getting in the way of that.”

The plaintiffs are aiming to have the two laws declared unconstitutional, which could ultimately lead to their overturning. The state’s constitution enshrines a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which the perpetuation of an oil and gas-based electricity sector impinges upon, the lawsuit argues.

“We’ve argued that the fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts resulting from the approval of fossil fuel power plants is harming the plaintiff’s health, their homes, their property and their safety, and ultimately violating those constitutional rights to security and health,” Bellinger said.

The challengers also say the constitution’s invocation of the public trust doctrine, which requires certain natural resources to be held in the government’s trust for the public’s benefit, should force Wisconsin to protect navigable waters for present and future generations, including from the climate crisis.

Climate impacts on Wisconsin are mounting, including not only flooding and rapid freeze-thaw cycles but also wildfires, ecosystem degradation and increasing extreme heat. Each of these is taking a toll on local youth, the lawsuit says.

“I coached tennis during the summer, but I recently did have to give it up due to such extreme weather and extreme climate events that don’t make it safe for me to be outside any more,” said Kaarina. “Also, my family enjoys gardening at my grandparents’ tree farm nearby, and my summers in the gardens have been cut short due to such extreme heat that does not make it safe to be outside, and extreme weather events that ultimately washes away the gardens that we’ve put so much incredible work into.”

Plaintiffs have also experienced asthma worsened by the burning of fossil fuels, while Indigenous challengers have seen their access to traditional foods hampered by ecosystem degradation and warming waters, the lawsuit says.

“Our clients are asking the court to uphold their right to a livable future,” said Tony Wilkin Gibart, executive director of Midwest Environmental Advocates. “This case is about whether they will inherit a future shaped by clean energy and a stable climate – or one burdened by fossil fuel pollution, extreme weather events, and growing threats to their health and safety.”

The lawsuit comes as the federal government rolls back a slew of environmental rules and worked to boost fossil fuels. In May, Our Children’s Trust sued the Trump administration for some of its anti-environmental executive orders; the case will have a two-day evidentiary hearing next month.

Donald Trump’s policies have made youth climate action even more important, particularly at the state level, said Kaarina.

“There’s very many dark things going on in our world right now, and especially in our federal government,” she said. “However, I don’t think that that should squish the light that is in youth.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/461488f3029cdc4dd1063e0e5ec3608f6d43f548/586_0_3828_3063/master/3828.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=299df2010bf842a61678f6657695fcb8",N,,2025-08-23 06:59:22.181122

Wholf,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-utility-bills-are-rapidly-rising-in-some-states/,"One example — gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.
But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels.
Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.
""By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,"" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement.
Grumet cited EIA data and noted, ""The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.""","If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you're not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.

Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were ""THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!"" And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.

But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that's being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation — all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, ""When supply is scarce, then prices go up,"" he said.

Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity — or 120 gigawatts — by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.

The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.

The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.

U.S. falling behind on transmission

Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there's no shortage of fuel to add to the grid — it's a shortage of transmission that's the major problem.

At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.

To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.

""If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,"" Gramlich said.

AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.

""AI data centers are much more power intensive,"" Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. ""So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.""

Role of tariffs and equipment shortages

Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example — gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.

""The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,"" Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years — even as long as seven, according to a May analysis by S&P Global.

Energy sources

Over the past decade, the nation's energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won't be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.

""That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,"" Gramlich told CBS News.

But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.

""If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,"" Gramlich said.

Trump energy policies projected to raise prices

Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a ""National Energy Emergency"" executive order, arguing the country needs ""reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.""

Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.

The passage of Trump's signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.

OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O'Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.

O'Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, ""The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar – subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,"" said Ben Dietderich, the department's press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.

Ending Biden-era clean energy policies

Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects, according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.

""Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,"" said Bob Keefe, E2's executive director.

""By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,"" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, ""The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.""

Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive

To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich's firm, Grid Strategies.

""These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,"" said Gramlich.

Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation's electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.

If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates — 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 — the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.

After careful review, EPA said it is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions and determining seven petitions to be ineligible.

EPA policy set through the 2020 renewable volume obligations (RVO) rulemaking grants partial relief (a 50% exemption) when a small refinery can demonstrate that it faces partial economic hardship. Under the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief even if demonstrating partial hardship, EPA noted.

With the Aug. 22 action, the agency said it is ""getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences."" Concurrent with this decision, EPA will update the RFS Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect its action on the 175 petitions.

At the same time, EPA is reaffirming a policy to return RFS compliance credits, or Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year.

Under the RFS program, RINs have a two-year window for use, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the next. Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window, according to EPA. Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not affect the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

In addition, EPA said it will soon be submitting a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management & Budget on the proposed reallocations of exempted volumes for the 2023 and later compliance years. ""EPA does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016 to 2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use.""

EPA will also be providing updated information on how it intends to forecast SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in these actions and projected SREs granted for 2025-2027 in the “Set 2” proposal. The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.

In June, EPA announced its proposed RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. This Set 2 proposal ensures the RFS program remains true to the original intent of Congress to increase the use of homegrown biofuels to support American energy dependence and rural economies.

EPA is currently reviewing the input it received during the comment period, which closed Aug. 8, 2025, and is working on a final regulation. Upon publication of a supplemental proposed rule on potential reallocation of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes, EPA will accept public comments on this supplemental proposal.

The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) said in a statement it questions whether the refineries truly faced economic hardship but feels ""EPA’s approach for implementing these exemptions appears reasonable and should not disrupt the marketplace or reduce actual renewable fuel consumption.""

RFA president and chief executive officer Geoff Cooper added this approach should be ""minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs. We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

The American Biogas Council, which represents more than 400 companies all along the U.S. biogas supply chain, issued a statement applauding the timing of EPA’s actions on the exemptions and RVOs. Executive director Patrick Serfass said, “Issuing SREs now, before the RVOs are finalized, allows the EPA to balance both levers in the RFS to make sure they work together harmoniously and promote the healthy function of the RINs market. The RVOs set demand for the RINs market, and SREs decrease demand. Announcing the SREs now gives the EPA the opportunity to follow the recommendation from the American Biogas Council and other renewable fuel producers to increase RVOs, which would increase demand and balance out the impact of issuing SREs.

“Without an increase in RVOs, RIN credit prices could crash, creating a harmful economic ripple effect across rural America. The EPA can make this all work together to protect farmers and rural communities, who depend on a strong, stable RFS program,” Serfass added.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blte5a51c2d28bbcc9c/bltc363037a0fa004e7/68a8eadfae7db00fa3fa2a2a/Ethanol_plant_in_SD_Aerial_View_-Getty_Images.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-23 12:03:11.404993

That is down from its prior outlook of it turning a modest gross profit in 2025.","After two straight quarters of positive gross margins, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) returned to producing negative gross margins in the second quarter. This largely appears to be due to higher material costs, as China's cutback on the export of heavy rare-earth metals in the quarter disrupted supply chains and drove up the cost of electric vehicle (EV) production.

Meanwhile, a reduction of regulatory tax credits will be a headwind going forward, as the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit will expire at the end of September. As a result, Rivian lowered its expectations for 2025 regulatory credit sales from a prior outlook of $300 million down to $160 million. Tax credits are pure gross margin, so that reduction hurts. Tariffs will also be a headwind, with Rivian estimating that tariffs will cost it a couple of thousand dollars per vehicle.

The automaker said it is now looking for gross profits to be about breakeven for the full year. That is down from its prior outlook of it turning a modest gross profit in 2025. Gross margin and gross profit are key metrics for Rivian, as it must be able to make its vehicles for less than it sells them for to even think about becoming profitable and generating free cash flow down the road.

""Michigan State University is proud to expand our efforts with ADASTEC as we launch this new automated bus deployment on campus,"" said Judd Herzer, Director of Mobility and Innovation at MSU. ""SpartanXpress is not just a transit service. It's part of a living laboratory where cutting-edge technology meets real-world conditions. By operating one of the nation's only full-size format, fully automated buses within an existing campus network, we're creating safer, more sustainable, and more accessible mobility solutions while providing unmatched research and learning opportunities for our students, faculty, and industry partners.""

Named SpartanXpress through a campus-wide student contest, the bus will serve as a hands-on learning platform for students across multiple disciplines. Through access to performance data and real operational scenarios, future engineers and researchers will gain direct insight into how ADASTEC's SAE Level-4 automated driving software platform, flowride.ai, interacts with infrastructure, passengers, and varied traffic conditions, creating a living classroom that blends technology, education, and public service.

""Automated driving alone is not the destination, it's the starting point,"" said Dr. Ali Peker, CEO of ADASTEC. ""With Michigan State University, we are showing what's possible when technology, accessibility, and sustainability come together in one service. This bus is more than a vehicle, it's a living classroom, a community connector, and a model for how full-size SAE Level-4 automated driving can operate safely, inclusively, and in harmony with daily life. From snowy mornings to busy afternoons, it delivers real value to the people it serves while generating the insights that will drive cleaner, smarter, and more connected cities worldwide, building on the global deployments and real-world operations we have already achieved.""

Advanced Technology for Real-World Conditions

The FMVSS- and ADA-compliant bus is equipped with ADASTEC's advanced sensor suite including six LiDARs, six radars, eleven RGB cameras, a GNSS and a C-V2X onboard unit. flowride.ai manages all driving functions from acceleration and braking to steering and decision-making on pre-mapped urban routes in mixed traffic that includes cyclists, pedestrians, cars, buses, and trucks. The system communicates with surrounding infrastructure and other road users, intelligently adapting to dynamic traffic conditions while managing intersections, bus stops, and crosswalks without the need for human intervention.

Through vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, the system communicates with 13 traffic lights and roadside units for precise coordination at intersections and pedestrian crossings. Through C-V2X connectivity, the system also operates with continuous communication with traffic lights to ensure precise coordination. The bus operates reliably in adverse weather conditions including light snow, rain, and haze. It also features an automated accessibility ramp and ADA-compliant boarding, with real-time fleet monitoring and remote operation capabilities for enhanced safety. The maximum speed limit for the route is 25 mph. This level of situational awareness ensures uninterrupted service and makes sustainable automated transportation a natural part of campus life at MSU.

""At ADASTEC, our SAE Level-4 automated driving software platform is built to work hand-in-hand with connected vehicle infrastructure,"" said Cemre Kavvasoglu, Product Management Director, North America at ADASTEC. ""This deployment at Michigan State University not only provides safe and reliable service for students, faculty, and visitors, but also contributes valuable operational data to research efforts. By integrating with nine C-V2X roadside units, we are able to coordinate intersections with precision and generate real-world insights that will advance both public transportation and the education of future mobility leaders.""

Mr. Trump has been a critic of wind power for years, ever since he unsuccessfully tried to stop an offshore wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses.","The Trump administration on Friday ordered that all construction stop on Revolution Wind, a $4 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is already mostly built.

The 65-turbine project had obtained all necessary permits from the Biden administration, and nearly 70 percent of the turbines have been installed. The developers behind the project had said it was on track to produce enough electricity for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring.

Matthew Giacona, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, issued a letter on Friday to Orsted, the Danish company building the wind farm, ordering it to “halt all ongoing activities” because of unspecified issues.

“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests in the United States,” Mr. Giacona wrote, adding that Orsted “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the project.

The decision was first reported by The Daily Caller. The Interior Department declined to comment on the order to stop work on Revolution Wind.

In a statement, Orsted said that it was “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” including “potential legal proceedings.” The company said it still aimed to complete the project by next year.

Last week, Orsted said that it needed to raise an additional $9.4 billion to shore up its finances as it attempted to complete both Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, another large offshore wind project near Long Island, while contending with an industry downturn that has been exacerbated by President Trump’s opposition to wind farms.

“Orsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the U.S.,” said Rasmus Errboe, the company’s chief executive.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, said the state was “evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.”

“Trump wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy,” Mr. Tong said. “Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers.”

The Trump administration’s move against Revolution Wind is the latest in a series of its escalating attacks against the wind industry.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department opened a trade investigation into imported wind turbines and their components. The probe could result in further tariffs on the wind industry that could increase costs for offshore projects that are already underway.

Two weeks ago, the administration said it was reversing a Biden administration decision to approve the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a giant wind farm planned for southern Idaho. The administration said it had discovered “legal deficiencies” in the original approval but did not provide details.

The Interior Department had signaled last month that it would consider revoking federal permits for wind projects that opponents have sued over, even if those projects were already under construction.

In April, the Trump administration ordered a halt to work at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of Long Island that was already being built, without publicly providing a justification. After a month of negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, the administration let Empire Wind move forward, but administration officials suggested that they had done so only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state. Ms. Hochul has denied that any such deal was made.

Equinor, the developer behind Empire Wind, recently said that those delays and other regulatory changes affecting U.S. offshore wind projects had cost the company nearly $1 billion.

At the same time as it thwarts the wind industry, the Trump administration has taken several steps to boost oil and gas as well as coal, the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuel when it comes to burning it for electricity.

The Energy Department on Thursday extended an emergency order compelling a Michigan coal-burning power plant to stay open past its retirement date. The department has issued several orders to keep coal plants running past their planned closure dates, even in cases where the operators never sought an extension and ratepayers would shoulder the costs of complying.

“This administration has it exactly backward,” said Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest-growing energy sources of the future — solar and wind power.”

Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore energy companies, said in a statement the Trump administration decision would kill jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.

“Revolution Wind is already under construction and nearly complete, representing years of planning, billions in private investment, and significant progress for America’s offshore energy supply chain,” he said, adding, “Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts and communities already benefiting from the project.”

Green Oceans, a nonprofit group that has sued over the approvals of federal permits for Revolution Wind, praised the Trump administration’s move. “This decisive action demonstrates that the federal government finally recognizes the seriously flawed permitting process that allowed this project and others to move forward,” the group said in a statement.

Mr. Trump has been a critic of wind power for years, ever since he unsuccessfully tried to stop an offshore wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses. Mr. Trump has called the large turbines ugly and expensive and has insisted that offshore wind farms are killing endangered whales in the Atlantic Ocean, although scientists have said there is no evidence to support that claim.

The Biden administration had tried to accelerate the development of offshore wind, which is commonplace in Europe but barely exists in the United States, and approved nearly a dozen commercial-scale wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean. Yet some of those projects foundered as a result of soaring costs, high interest rates, supply chain delays and bursts of local opposition.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/22cli-wind/22cli-wind-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 08:02:12.661688

Transcript

Cris Sheridan:

Joining us on the show today is Doomberg. He's one of the most popular writers on Substack, covering everything from energy and the economy to geopolitics. We will have a link to his Substack column where you can sign up and follow more of his work. Doomberg, thanks for coming on and speaking with us.

Doomberg:

Hey, great to be back with you.

Cris Sheridan:

So, Doomberg, we've covered a number of different topics with you over the years, including many of the things that I just mentioned: energy, the economy, and geopolitics. You have in your tagline how energy is life. However, when it comes to the major financial media news channels and the wider investment base, it seems that most people do not understand just how important energy is until they're forced to reckon with it.

Doomberg:

Yeah, absolutely. One of the great mysteries of our time is why so few macro analysts or geopolitical strategists start their analysis with energy. Energy should not be treated like any other commodity. It is vital to standards of living. It's vital to winning wars. The history of modern warfare can be traced through the lens of energy. Daniel Yergin has written some great books in this regard. And so, when you study, for example, the relative geopolitical positioning of, say, Russia and the United Kingdom, all you have to do is download a copy of the Statistical Review of World Energy and start making a few plots. And you see one is an energy superpower and the other is a flaccid energy vassal. Energy explains geopolitical tensions. Anytime we see a skirmish in a weird country involving great powers, it is almost always an oil pipeline, a gas pipeline, or a critical energy choke point. And so, physics is a great indicator of how things should be. It doesn't necessarily predict the future, but it tells you the direction of travel pretty accurately. And so, whenever we look at the world, we have a whole series of indicators on our Bloomberg dashboard that we look at every day. And you can kind of tell how the world is doing, where there are geopolitical hotspots, and so on. So, it's just a great place to start. When we launched Doomberg four and a half years ago, there weren't many people doing it, especially with the industrial lens that we brought to our writing. And so, it's been a success. We've obviously demonstrated product-market fit and are having a blast doing it.

Cris Sheridan:

And I want to dive into some of your recent pieces and also speak with you about a theme that came up this week on our show. Tell us a little bit from your viewpoint, given a lot of what you cover on your Substack column, about just how important energy is when it comes to overall competitiveness on the global stage.

Doomberg:

An electricity grid is a foundation for a developed economy. China has by far the largest and most sophisticated energy grid in the world, backed by a mountain of coal that it burns literally every day. More than half of all of the world's coal, I think it's 56%, is now burned by China. It's cheap, it's domestic, they stockpile it, and they produce two and a quarter times as much electricity as the US does, and it's growing quite rapidly. China is a very large country. It's a very impressive country. I competed against Chinese companies and sold into China during my career. I have a fair number of friends there and a pretty good understanding of the country. People in the West have this techno-arrogance about them when they look at countries like China, India, and Russia. These are very sophisticated countries. China does all manner of dirty tricks to achieve its geopolitical objectives. You should expect that your geopolitical opponents will behave that way and prepare accordingly. But yeah, among the many reasons why China has such a huge manufacturing base is the fact that it has such a large and sophisticated electricity grid. One of the plots that you can do when you look at the fate of a country is to plot how much electricity it produces. Take a look at the grid's reliability. You know, a 99% reliable grid is functionally useless for a developed economy. It needs to be far higher than that. 99.97 is the US target. They're held to what's known as a 1-in-10 standard: one day of outage over 10 years cumulatively. And so, China is leading the pack there. They're leading the pack in critical minerals. They're leading the pack in automotive production. If it weren't for tariffs, BYD would put the big automakers out of business overnight. They can't compete with that local cost structure. So, they've been strategic, they've been effective. And we did a whole presentation on China last year called ""The Year of the Dragon: China through the Lens of Energy."" Back to my first answer about the importance of energy: if you just look at China through the lens of energy, you see the weaving of their strategy with tactics, and it's pretty self-evident.

Cris Sheridan:

Yeah. And now they're building the world's largest dam. And I know you recently wrote about that. Tell us a bit about the Maidong Dam they're building based on your analysis and some of the facts that we see there.

Doomberg:

Yeah. So, we wrote a piece a couple of weeks ago, as you mentioned, called ""Five Dams in Tibet."" And it's really a colossal project. It's been getting a fair bit of print coverage in the mainstream media. We decided to write about it. The largest dam in the world right now is in China. It's called the Three Gorges Dam, and it is rated to produce 22.5 gigawatts of power. Just to give you some benchmark, that's more than 10 times the size of Diablo Canyon in California, California's last remaining nuclear power plant. And they're going to build five run-of-the-river dams in Tibet. And the combined capacity of those dams is going to be 60 gigawatts, which is just mind-boggling--two-thirds the rated capacity of the US's entire nuclear power fleet in one project. It's going to be a massive project. It's going to affect global demand for diesel, cement, truck tires--you name it, it's going to be a boom. Now, one of the things that's interesting about this project is that it is a run-of-the-river dam, not an impoundment hydroelectric dam. There's a big difference between those two. Run-of-the-river dams are baseload power but typically not very dispatchable. Even though this dam, because it's run-of-the-river, should have less of an environmental footprint--there's no big flooding upstream of the dam to worry about--it won't be as dispatchable. It won't serve to stabilize the grid in a way that a standard hydroelectric dam does. But this is a really fascinating project. I don't doubt for a second that they're going to get it done, and then it's going to work.

Cris Sheridan:

You were talking about how it's supposed to be 60 gigawatts of power, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that is the equivalent of roughly 60 nuclear reactors.

Doomberg:

Right. Yeah. And you know, an AP1000 reactor is about a gigawatt. Now, nuclear power reactors tend to run at a higher capacity factor. So, you have to consider that the rated capacity and the amount of power it produces--you know, we would probably anticipate that this dam would produce at about a 50 or 60% capacity factor, and much depends on the rainy season and all that stuff. But nonetheless, it is a mind-bogglingly big project, and China is probably the only country in the world capable of pulling it off from an engineering perspective.

Cris Sheridan:

The clearest example that we can see where they have absolutely taken the lead over the US and every other country is when you look at the amount of electricity and power that they are generating domestically--no other nation even comes close at this point. How important is this in terms of setting them up for being the next superpower?

Doomberg:

Better still, they've tricked much of the Western world into buying solar panels and wind turbines while they're burning the world's coal at a lower price than it would otherwise be because demand is going down in the West. They take their energy very, very seriously. Here's China's strategy in a nutshell: whenever they decide to get strategic about an industry that they're not naturally endowed with, they find the earliest part of the value chain that they can dominate through financial brute force. So, China is short on oil. It is the world's largest refiner of oil as measured by capacity. So, if China loses its oil, its neighbors pay a hefty price too, because many countries rely on Chinese exports, for example. And so, they're pretty strategic about things. The US used to be this way. The US built the National Highway System in the '50s, and they used to build stuff. The US used to build stuff--it doesn't anymore. Outside of the primary energy companies, which are cutting-edge technological superpowers that actually build real stuff on a massive scale, the rest of the US is lagging significantly. And this is being exposed in the war in Ukraine. Of course, that is a war of attrition that NATO has lost. And it lost it because it doesn't make stuff anymore. It doesn't make its own weapons. Eighty percent of the US military-industrial complex supply chains pass through China at some point. Of course, China helping Russia has defeated NATO in Ukraine. And this is what happens when you hollow out your manufacturing base in the name of quarterly results as pressured by Wall Street. And China doesn't have those issues.

Cris Sheridan:

You know, it's very interesting because when we think about how China is just so far ahead in terms of electricity production--again, they're building this dam now, which is the equivalent of 60 nuclear reactors. That is a lot of electricity that's going to be produced from this world's largest dam that they're building. You think that they are going to be successful in doing this, but the US has so much catching up to do now at this point. Trump is trying to change that. He's trying to streamline the regulatory process, fast-track nuclear power development. There are a number of things that he's doing, but I don't think--at least from my point of view, and I'd like to get your thoughts on this--can the US actually do what's necessary? Can it catch up? It seems like it is so far behind now at this point.

Doomberg:

I'm a little more optimistic than that. If you wanted to make the bullish case, the US is a global energy giga-power. It is by far the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. It has an enormous coal reserve base. Natural gas in the US--obviously, it's a very regionalized market, prices vary--but on balance, natural gas in the US is the cheapest, cleanest hydrocarbon base in the world. There are an enormous number of cogeneration facilities in the US; these facilities produce electricity and steam, typically for heavy industry. The US has the resources. Whether it needs to catch up to China is a whole question--I don't know why we always assume that to compete globally, you have to bring other countries down. I mean, the Western Hemisphere is endowed with so much energy that if Trump could just get out of this war in Ukraine, keep the peace in the Middle East, and come to a détente with China, there's plenty to do on this side of the world. We published a piece this morning called ""Blooming Flower."" We were talking about how, once a critical mass of super-majors ends up in a location, it tends to branch out and produce more and more oil. And that's happening at the interface between the Caribbean and the northern bit of South America, namely Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname, so there's plenty here. Greenland, Arctic Argentina has a massive shale resource that's just now coming to life--it could be on par with the Permian by the time it's done, assuming that Milei gets their economic house in order. There's no need to catch up to China. The US is a wealthy country. It can make stuff again, and it should. And kudos to Trump for trying. But also, I think Trump is a bit delusional about the current state of the US and how prepared it is to compete on the world stage with China and Russia. Right now, 1985 isn't walking through that door, but I do think that Trump's instincts are correct. And so, yeah, it's going to be fascinating to watch.

Cris Sheridan:

You mentioned this earlier, but where does grid stability fit into this conversation? Of course, we did see a major outage in Europe, and the US is increasingly facing more and more outages, and those outages are lasting longer than they have in the past. Many guests have commented that our grid goes back, you know, 100 years or so and is highly dilapidated. So, tell us a little bit about the problem the US faces from an electrical grid standpoint. Of course, we did note earlier that China has now taken the lead in terms of the amount of electricity produced in their country, head and shoulders above any other nation. But if you wouldn't mind, comment a little bit about the US and the issues it faces when it comes to its own electrical grid.

Doomberg:

A couple of things. The first step is recognizing that you have the problem, and Trump gets full grades for that. Also, we're at a turning point in the intermittent renewables debate--just in time, hopefully. The US Northeast is struggling with its ""oh, you know what"" moment. You know, as a fundamental rule of thumb for people who aren't as familiar with how the grid actually operates, we put a promotional presentation out between now and the end of August. Anybody who subscribes to Doomberg gets a free copy of a presentation called ""Cocktail Party Trivia: Winning the Renewables Debate with Friends and Family."" Anytime intermittency begins to rub up against dispatchability as far as share on the grid goes, things start to break, and it's just no more complicated than that. So, natural gas is like the perfect fuel for a grid because it is both baseload--you could run it 24/7--but it is also very dispatchable. Grid operators can perfectly match supply with demand by toggling natural gas plants in a matter of minutes. And grid reliability is a subset of grid operators' ability to perfectly match supply with demand. And when you have intermittent renewables like wind and solar that the grid must make room for when they decide to show up, and the grid must have backup for when the wind doesn't blow or it's nighttime, when you get enough--typically, say, 10 to 15%, as California is proving--you have these huge swings in intermittency that the grid operators have to account for. And then, the final point on grid stability is that wind and solar are known as inverter-based resources, whereas nuclear power plants, coal plants, and natural gas plants have giant spinning turbines. And those giant spinning turbines impart upon the grid what's known as inertia. And inertia allows grid operators to ride out small faults that might otherwise cascade because operating a grid is a deeply nonlinear complex system upon which linearity is enforced in part by these giant spinning turbines. And when you have an insufficient amount of inertia on the grid, you end up being susceptible to what happened in Spain. A small fault at one solar facility cascaded through the entire system. There was insufficient inertia because, hey, it's sunny in Spain, and they've got so much solar that basically the entire grid was running on renewables. Well, there you go--the grid collapsed. And so, why people don't see this or understand this is a great mystery. We're going to see it happen in Australia, by the way. It's going to happen in China, we think, this year. We note with great interest that Chinese solar is penetrating around 8 to 10% of the grid, I believe. And suddenly, they put a pause in May on new approvals because it just becomes, I mean, the laws of physics are the laws of physics. The amount of batteries you would need to install to back up an entire grid for any period of time is absurd--it just can't happen. And so, many challenges with the grid. But to your original question, Trump has gutted much of the Inflation Reduction Act and the subsidies for wind and solar, unfairly, we think. He has destroyed the US wind sector. I just think that this incredible regulatory whiplash is unfair and is not conducive to capital formation. On balance, because the wind sector goes from ""you must build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind"" to basically the whole thing gets shut down in a matter of years. And the last point is the length of heavy industry's capital planning cycle is longer than the US political cycle. And that sets up for whiplash. And so, if a Democrat wins in '28, all of these pro-growth investments that Trump has been making would pivot. And so, it is risky. But you know, you have to start somewhere.

Cris Sheridan:

There has been a growing recognition this decade, I would say, that nuclear power needs to play a much more prominent role. China and India have recognized this, and they've been pushing forward and building nuclear, as many other nations have. The US is now starting to recognize this. Again, like we mentioned, Trump is attempting to move in this direction. There's bipartisan support behind it as well--it's not just Trump. So, we're seeing an effort in that direction. What is your point of view? How fast could we realistically phase in nuclear power and alleviate some of these bottlenecks that we see with electricity?

Doomberg:

Yeah, that's a political choice for sure. If France could build a power grid that has 70% nuclear on it 50 years ago, surely the US could do it today. The US has 90 operating reactors or so--93, I think, is the number. But China's putting up nuclear power plants at a record clip at an enviable price. But the Koreans can do it--the Koreans are quite competitive with the Chinese. Russia is actually the leading exporter of nuclear technology in the world. Very few people understand that, but Rosatom is a very widely respected constructor of nuclear reactors. And they provide the enriched uranium for them and help maintain them over the decades. Nuclear is great because it is a baseload power. It is not very dispatchable, as France is now finding out, because France has been loading its grid with solar and forcing nuclear power plants to react, and that's causing maintenance issues and other troubles with the grid. And you know, of course, France, too, is now putting a pause on new solar rollout because they realize after this stuff is built that you actually need a grid that's able to use it. There's a world where Russia, China, Korea, the US, and Canada are generating gigawatt reactors at a record clip. I think we're going to see China overtake the US in nuclear energy soon--by soon, I mean 15 years or so. So, we'll see. But the US--it's the time it takes to build a reactor and the cost it takes to build a reactor are overtly political choices. They just are. And judicial constraints, permitting constraints--Canada, Ontario, built out its nuclear reactors 50 years ago. Again, there's nothing technologically difficult about doing it. It is just a matter of political will.

Cris Sheridan:

Well, how long does it take on average? I mean, you did cite that, but regulatory hurdles obviously play a major role in that timeline. But, you know, I mean, I believe it's on the order of six to eight years on average here in the US--10 years. Whereas China, it's probably closer to what, like three to five?

Doomberg:

Yeah, you could probably get it done start to finish with political will in four years. I think the Japanese kind of proved that out. China's going a little bit faster than that. But let's say the last, you know, the most recent US build in Georgia was a catastrophe. It was wildly over budget and took way, way too long to make. If the US could get down to about five years, I think it would be quite a feat. I know that Secretary Wright has nuclear ambitions as part of the Trump administration. The real challenge is the nuclear industry doesn't do itself many favors. You know, the free market works most of the time. It fails in two regards: it fails in properly measuring environmental impact, and it fails in national security as well. So, there's, like, China is just going to build nuclear reactors. And as our friend Mark Nelson likes to say, these reactors will live forever--like, 80 years from now, the current reactor fleet of the US will still be operating. These are forever factories of electricity, basically. And so, it's kind of like building the US highway system. If Trump could get 10 or 15 reactors on the go before his term is over and they have some reasonable completion, I think that would be a lasting legacy. There is a sort of cost curve of where the next reactors would go. And you would start with sites that are already approved to expand and are already, you know--let's say a site was approved to build six reactors, and there's two reactors on it. You put the next four there before you would start a completely new greenfield site. So, the problem that the nuclear industry has is it hasn't really settled on a standard design, and it has fallen for the trap that environmentalists have set for them, which is they are trying to solve political problems with technology. So, let's just take a little sidebar and talk about fusion for a second. Fusion is a giant waste of time and money. The two problems it purports to solve are fake: nuclear waste and meltdown risk. Those aren't real problems--they're concocted problems by Malthusian environmentalists. I'll just give you two examples. The first is nuclear waste is not waste--it's partially spent fuel that can be reprocessed. The vast majority of the embodied energy in a spent nuclear fuel rod is still there. And we view nuclear waste as a gift to future engineers because they can just pass them through a fast-breeder reactor and recycle them and bring them back online, and they don't have to mine the uranium and enrich the uranium--it's all just right there. And then, the second is this whole nuclear meltdown risk and the catastrophic overreaction to radiation that the environmentalists have pulled off. A giant dam in China collapsed in 1975--the name of that dam escapes me, but it was, you know, a freak storm of the century. And a bunch of dams collapsed downstream of that one, and the flooding was horrific. And the estimated number of deaths was somewhere between 50,000 to 250,000. One person died from Fukushima four years after the accident because of cancer--a tragedy for that one person, to be sure. When that dam collapsed in China, did we go about deconstructing all the other hydroelectric dams around the world? No. And by the way, more people have died falling off wind turbines while servicing them than have died from Fukushima. You know, energy is all about trade-offs. And so, fusion then solves two fake problems. And by the time fusion is ready--it is perpetually four decades away from being ready--the same environmentalists who have tricked everybody about fission would concoct fake problems to obstruct the deployment of fusion. That's how it's going to go. So, just take the best of 1980s technology and build it over and over and over and over and over again. That is the slightly obvious answer. If we had our way, the US would build CANDU reactors--beautiful design, safe to operate, off you go. And, you know, but Westinghouse, AP1000, whatever--it doesn't matter. Pick the design. Who cares what it is? Pick the Chinese reactors, pick the Russian reactors--they're amazing feats of engineering. If fission was invented today, it would be hailed as a civilization-saving technology. And if aliens visited us today, they'd be puzzled as to why there aren't fission reactors all over the place. It really is a testimony to the power of Malthusian environmentalists that nuclear has been painted with such a bad brush.

Cris Sheridan:

Those are some really good points that you made. And I'd like to get your thoughts on the race over data centers and how this fits into artificial intelligence. Because one of the things that we've been discussing is you want to be exposed as an investor to what is probably the most important investment theme that we've seen in our recent lifetimes with this race over artificial intelligence. But, of course, data centers feature prominently in that. The US has the largest number, I think, at around 5,000. I think there's 8,000 globally, maybe closer to 10,000 now, but the US has the largest number and highest concentration of data centers. But one of the key bottlenecks, again going back to the theme of our discussion today, is electricity and grid stability.

Doomberg:

Yeah, so we've been on this for a while. We wrote a piece last year called ""Bridge Burning,"" where we predicted that natural gas would be the bridge fuel. And then we followed that up with a piece called ""Irreconcilable Differences,"" where we made a call that we actually don't think the data centers are going to go on-grid. The existing grid is not made to grow at the pace with which AI data center demand is growing. Second, that electricity is more valuable to a data center than what the current market price is, which means prices would be going up for everybody. We're seeing that already. And so, we believe that the long-term solution is you have natural gas going into one end of the building and data coming out of the other. And maybe it's connected to the grid for backup, but we're seeing this now. So, we just wrote a piece called ""Out with the Old: Powering AI Without Crowding Out Grid Demand."" We published that on August 13th. What we're seeing now is all of these coal plants that were shut down are perfect places to build new natural gas power plants with a data center co-located on it because they have the grid connection already, so the grid can provide backup. But in reality, it's not crowding out existing demand because they're bringing on new gas turbines. So, the two projects that we profiled in that piece, both driven by EQT, the largest natural gas producer in the Marcellus Shale--a kind of pure play there, a great company run by the Rice family. The Rice family knows how to make money. They're drilling the natural gas and have signed agreements to fund a 4.4-gigawatt facility at the old Homer City coal plant--a great deal there. And then another one as well, the Shippingport Industrial Park project northwest of Pittsburgh, another 3.6 gigawatts. So, 8 gigawatts of natural gas going in, new electricity supply coming online, 85-90% of that electricity is earmarked for the data center, and the rest can dance with the grid if the grid needs a little help, or vice versa. But by and large, this is threading the needle because you can't really put much more in the way of new demand onto the existing grids without new supply. Finally, if you're running your own facilities, you tend to be able to keep the stability issue at bay because you're kind of just like, you know, we like to think of these as basically giant buildings where gas goes in and data comes out. And so, I think that's going to be the trend. EQT is pretty forward-looking. We don't own any stock, by the way. We don't invest publicly; we do invest privately. And one of the things we've been toying with is the AI market. And, boy, you want to talk about a bubble--huge amount of money flowing into the VC world. I read yesterday, again because we are participating in one of them, there are 498 AI unicorns--startups that have raised a valuation of a billion or more. And when I sent that to the founder of the company that we're involved in, his immediate reply was, ""Let's make it 499,"" to which I said, ""Yes, please, I'd be winding down Doomberg pretty quick if we do.""

Cris Sheridan:

Here at our firm, we're definitely trying to look at the ecosystem behind the AI bubble, as you called it. I mean, when you just look at the trillions of dollars that are being invested in this direction, the amount of money going into data centers, but also the amount of energy that's required to service this--these are all the different ways that you can invest around this theme. So many ways to tackle this. You don't have to just put all your money in Nvidia, of course. And I think, as you said, you know, there are some different ways that you can do that from an energy and electricity standpoint, where natural gas is playing a pivotal role.

Doomberg:

Yeah, when we invest, we always look for energy plays that are tied to volume, not price. So, we would shy away from energy producers, and we certainly wouldn't invest in the commodity directly because the long-term real price of all commodities is lower. But any company that is leveraged to volume or facilitates the release of energy volume is very interesting to us. So, service providers in the Permian, for example--if I was to do a startup, I always try to think of, like, what startup can I create out of this? Right, thinking laterally. So, any startup that has breakthrough technology that helps facilitate the produced water issue in the Permian, for example, would be very interesting to us because that is constraining production in some ways. So, royalty plays--you know, obviously, GE Vernova is flying. The stock is flying because it has a multi-year backlog of gas turbines, and it's a printing press, basically, for them. It's even outdoing their terrible wind business, which hopefully they would shut down eventually and just take a loss and write it off. And so, those are the types of things we look for: is it leveraged to volume, or does it release volume? Then that gets interesting as we close.

Cris Sheridan:

Doomberg, you are an excellent writer, as I noted, one of the most popular Substack writers. What's the best way that our listeners can follow more of your work?

Doomberg:

Yeah, you can find everything at doomberg.com, D-O-O-M-B-E-R-G.com. We ejected a squatter off of that domain name last year for a healthy price, unfortunately. But that's where everything is. We publish about 90 articles a year, and then we also have a premium tier that gets, in addition to those 90 articles, a monthly presentation that usually runs around 45 minutes to an hour on a deep dive. I mentioned one earlier--you know, ""China through the Lens of Energy"" is a pretty classic Doomberg pro talk--and all of our podcast appearances, like this one, are under our Doomcast tab as well. So, look, it's been great, I really appreciate it. Always have a good time with you guys and look forward to coming back.

“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Rollins said.
A view of active, utility scale solar projects in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, power grid shows Iowa has fewer solar projects than surrounding states in the MISO power grid.
Rollins’ announcement also noted solar panels manufactured by “foreign adversaries” could not be used in USDA projects.
According to Clean Grid Alliance, Iowa farmers and landowners receive $4.3 million annually in land-lease payments for solar projects.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it would restrict the use of federal subsidies for solar energy projects in favor of protecting farmland, but clean energy advocates say solar gives farmers a higher production value per acre than any traditional crop.

A press release from USDA notes specific funding programs can no longer be used for wind and solar projects. The action, the release said, furthers the department’s goal to end taxpayer support of “unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and ensure the supply chain consists of American products and manufacturing.”

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in the release the changes also will stop the loss of prime farmland to solar fields. According to the release, the number of solar panels on U.S. farmland has increased by more than 50 percent since 2012.

Rollins said beginning farmers have a more difficult time entering the agricultural market when they also have to compete with solar projects for land.

“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Rollins said. “It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage.”

Scale in Iowa

USDA defines prime farmland as land with the “best combination” of characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops. This land must also be available for these uses, per the definition.

According to the Clean Grid Alliance, about 17.5 million acres of Iowa’s 30 million acres of farmland are considered prime agricultural ground.

The Clean Grid Alliance analyzed data from USDA and the power grid for the central U.S. and found that if all of the proposed solar projects in Iowa were built on only prime farmland, it would occupy 0.2 percent — or about 35,000 acres — of prime farmland in the state.

The alliance report shows in 2025, Iowa had 677 megawatts of solar online, and on about 5,755 acres of land. A view of active, utility scale solar projects in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, power grid shows Iowa has fewer solar projects than surrounding states in the MISO power grid.

Rollins’ announcement also noted solar panels manufactured by “foreign adversaries” could not be used in USDA projects. Rollins said again in a press release Thursday that foreign-made solar panels would not be allowed in USDA projects. This separate release directed agencies to prioritize land use efficiency in power generation projects on National Forest System lands.

According to a 2022 report from the International Energy Agency, China “dominates” solar manufacturing and accounts for more than 80 percent of the share in all manufacturing stages for solar panels.

The USDA initiative would target the Business and Industry program and the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, both of which are under USDA Rural Development.

Per the press release, wind and solar projects are no longer eligible under the Business and Industry program.

Recipients of REAP must ensure any wind or solar installations are “right-sized for their facilities.” The release specifies that ground mount solar photovoltaic systems must be smaller than 50 kilowatts and be able to record historical energy use to remain eligible under the REAP program.

USDA did not detail how it would judge location or solar panel origin as it relates to these programs.

Clean energy advocates say the action restricts farmers’ choices

Andy Olsen, the senior policy advocate for Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a statement that USDA’s claim to protect farmland was “dubious.”

Olsen said commercial development and data centers are “legitimate threats” to American farmland, while wind and solar projects can “coexist successfully with crops or grazing.”

Olsen argued the REAP program gave farmers and rural businesses “greater freedom” to care for their operations. The program has been used for things like rooftop solar on small businesses or on top of hog barns. Other grants have helped with energy efficiency upgrades at farms and rural businesses.

“Any conversation around protecting farmland should come from thoughtful, balanced input, not blanket restrictions that strip choices from the very people REAP was designed to serve,” Olsen said in a statement.

REAP was established in the 2008 Farm Bill, and funding for the program increased substantially under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Olsen also said solar and wind projects give farmers the ability to generate energy on their own and to create additional revenue streams.

According to Clean Grid Alliance, Iowa farmers and landowners receive $4.3 million annually in land-lease payments for solar projects.

The fact sheet from the alliance also notes solar pays significantly more per acre than traditional row crops. According to its data, solar can generate a production value of $11,068 per acre, annually, for farmers. Corn, by contrast, has a per acre production value of about $930. These figures are dependent on the price of electricity and on corn.

Some larger-scale solar projects in Iowa are managed and run by utility companies, including the 150 megawatt Wever Solar Project, operated by Alliant Energy in Lee County.

A spokesperson for Alliant said the company did not seek federal grants from USDA for any of its solar projects and is not impacted by this latest decision from USDA.",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com/?uuid=fa482997-b914-5075-b57f-67431a70ab45&type=preview&q=75&width=1200&height=800,N,,2025-08-23 10:00:12.147769

I recently had the distinct honor to join a House Natural Resources Committee Congressional delegation, or CODEL, to Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Along with Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas), Congresswoman Sarah Elfreth (R-Maryland), Congresswoman Celeste Maloy (R-Utah), and Congressman Nick Begich (R-Alaska), we met with allied foreign leaders and the business community to discuss a host of issues relating to our committee work and the state of Wyoming, including; forestry, energy, mining, resource development, fishing, and national parks.

South Korea is a country that has historically understood the value of free markets, sovereign decision-making, and the importance of standing strong in the face of growing threats from communist China and North Korea. These are not abstract geopolitical concerns; they are daily realities in this region. South Korea’s geographic proximity to both adversaries means our alliance is not just symbolic, but it is strategic, necessary, and mutually beneficial.

South Korea relies on imported energy to fuel its economic engine. What we heard loud and clear from our meetings is that this region is eager to increase imports of reliable, affordable American coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Yet, American producers, particularly those in energy-rich states like Wyoming, are hindered by misguided federal and state policies that restrict access to export markets, particularly through our West Coast ports. Until resolved, restrictive policies driven by subservience to “climate change” politics in blue states along our western shores stands in the way of Wyoming and the U.S. realizing even greater economic opportunity, one which helps our allies in the process.

Wyoming’s energy resources are among the most abundant and reliable in the world. Our coal is clean and abundant. Our natural gas is plentiful. We produce energy more responsibly and with greater regulatory transparency than any other nation on Earth. There is no reason why Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan should not be able to import our resources to meet their development and energy needs. Doing so would not only strengthen their national security but bolster the U.S. economy as well. It is a win for all involved.

In the entire Indo-Pacific region, the Chinese Communist Party continually pursues hegemonic control, and North Korea remains unpredictable under a dictator seeking global relevance. Regional security for our allies rests on a healthy defense relationship with the U.S. This is a true two-way partnership, as the U.S. receives in return an initial buffer between such regional threats and our homeland, in addition to a forward presence for our military bases to deter the CCP. In fact, we had the distinct privilege to visit U.S. troops stationed at the U.S. Naval Base Fleet Activities Yokosuka (CFAY) to discuss the nature and importance of their work and to personally thank them for their service and sacrifice. We also had the opportunity to visit the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom and take a tour of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between South and North Korea.

I am committed to deepening these partnerships — not only for our defense and diplomatic ties, but also trade, resource development, and business-to-business collaboration. South Korea is an innovator in technology and manufacturing. Wyoming is a leader in energy and natural resource development. There is enormous potential in expanding our cooperation, and it is time we removed the roadblocks that stand in the way.

The trip we took was one of strengthening existing relationships and forging new ones. Building relationships with world political and business leaders will open even more opportunities for Wyoming’s businesses. There is an ever-growing demand for Wyoming’s reliable, affordable, and dispatchable energy resources. As we prepare for the future, the U.S. must continue to engage, to lead, and to insist on the ability to export prosperity to the world.

Faced with a perfect storm of energy insecurity, supply chain fragility, and the relentless rise of China and the U.S., the EU has launched a multi-pronged offensive to secure its future. This isn't just about survival—it's about seizing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution. For investors, the question isn't whether to act, but where to allocate capital to ride the wave of structural transformation.

The Clean Energy Gold Rush: Where the EU is Betting Big

The EU's Horizon Europe program has allocated €636.6 million for 2025 to accelerate climate-neutral technologies, with a laser focus on hydrogen, battery storage, and grid modernization. The Net-Zero Technologies call alone received 359 proposals for €2.4 billion, underscoring the frenzy in heavy industries like cement and chemicals. These sectors are not just “greening” their operations—they're reinventing themselves.

Take battery storage: The EU's Electric Vehicle Battery Cell Manufacturing call received 14 proposals for €1.6 billion, far exceeding its budget. Lithium-ion NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) technology is the holy grail here, and European startups like Northvolt and ACC (A Better Battery) are racing to scale. But the real opportunity lies in the supply chain. With the EU's Omnibus legislation slashing renewable energy permitting delays from a decade to six months, infrastructure plays in solar, wind, and grid storage are primed for explosive growth.

AI as the Secret Sauce: Digital Twins and Energy Data Spaces

The EU's latest report on AI in energy systems is a masterclass in strategic thinking. By leveraging AI to create digital twins of the European grid, the bloc is not just optimizing energy flows—it's building a real-time, decentralized network that can predict outages, manage microgrids, and even enable consumers to trade energy like stock options. This isn't science fiction; it's happening now.

The concept of “AI Factories”—dedicated hubs for training energy-specific AI models—is a game-changer. These facilities will require massive compute power, driving demand for high-performance computing infrastructure and cloud services. Companies like Atos and Siemens are already positioning themselves as key players in this space. Meanwhile, the EU's push for harmonized data standards and Model Delivery Networks (MDNs) will create a fertile ground for edge computing and AI-as-a-Service providers.

The China Factor: Strategic Partnerships in a Fractured World

While the EU is tightening its noose around AI exports to China, it's doubling down on clean energy collaboration. Chinese giants like CATL and Gotion High-Tech are building battery gigafactories in Europe, supplying critical components for the green transition. These partnerships aren't just about cost—they're about securing supply chains for rare earth minerals and critical metals.

The EU's Single Market Strategy is also opening doors for Chinese firms in renewable energy and smart manufacturing. Projects like the Pelješac Bridge in Croatia and the Hungary-Serbia Railway highlight the EU's willingness to leverage Chinese capital for infrastructure. For investors, this means opportunities in joint ventures, green bonds, and cross-border tech licensing deals.

The Geopolitical Playbook: Why the EU Can't Afford to Wait

The EU's Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act (IDAA) and the CBAM simplification are more than regulatory tweaks—they're existential moves to outpace China and the U.S. in decarbonizing heavy industries. By creating lead markets for low-carbon products, the EU is forcing global competitors to raise their game.

But the clock is ticking. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the EU's Green Deal Industrial Plan are creating a transatlantic race to dominate clean tech. The EU's recent $40 billion AI chip purchase from the U.S. underlines its strategic alignment with Washington, but it also highlights the need to invest in homegrown alternatives. Startups in the EU's Scaleup Europe Fund—focused on AI, hydrogen, and carbon capture—are the next Microsofts and Telsas waiting to be discovered.

The Bottom Line: Act Now or Miss the Boat

The EU's push for innovation is not a passing trend—it's a structural shift. Clean energy infrastructure, AI-driven grid management, and strategic partnerships with China in green tech are the pillars of this transformation. For investors, the key is to act decisively:

Clean Energy Infrastructure: Prioritize companies involved in battery storage, hydrogen production, and grid modernization.

AI and Digital Twins: Target firms building AI Factories, edge computing solutions, and energy data platforms.

China-EU Collaborations: Look for joint ventures in solar, EVs, and critical mineral supply chains.

The EU may be geopolitically irrelevant in some circles, but its ability to innovate and adapt is anything but. This is your moment to bet on the bloc's quiet revolution.

Jairam Ramesh has criticized the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project, labeling it an ecological disaster being ""bulldozed"" through. He alleges that the rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act have not been settled, despite claims by the administration. The project, involving a port, airport, township, and power plant, threatens the habitat of vulnerable tribal groups.

Congress leader and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh on Saturday described the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project as a ""maha ecological disaster"" and alleged that it is simply being ""bulldozed"" through.

He cited his earlier conversation with the Union environment minister on the issue, where he raised concerns over the project, but lamented that it has not yielded any tangible results.

He also cited media reports to say that fresh evidence suggests that rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act have not been settled.

""The Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project is without doubt a maha ecological disaster. I have had exchanges with the Union Minister of Environment and Forests on this subject but the march of folly continues.

""Now comes fresh evidence that the administration has falsely claimed that the rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 have been identified and settled; the consent of the affected tribal communities themselves has not been lawfully obtained,"" he said in a post on X.

Live Events

""It has been abundantly clear for some time that the project is simply being bulldozed through,"" Ramesh said.

The Congress leader has been highlighting concerns over the Great Nicbar project, claiming that it is an ecological disaster and the rights of forest dwellers and tribals in the area have not been addressed.

The project, titled 'Holistic Development of Great Nicobar', involves the construction of a transhipment port, an international airport, a township and a power plant spanning more than 160 sq km. This includes around 130 sq km of pristine forest inhabited by the Nicobarese, a Scheduled Tribe (ST), and the Shompens, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), whose population is estimated to be between 200 and 300.

In 2020, the Department of Energy predicted that Appalachia was “on the cusp of an energy and petrochemical renaissance” fueled by abundant shale gas. The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.

“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.

For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility—first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities—was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant—which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates—is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.

Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”

What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility. “Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.

As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of least 25 years.

Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.

Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.

“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.

Shell’s Tax “Windfall” in Pennsylvania

Shell’s tax breaks from the state are behind its decision to push forward with the project even as other companies walked away from the “renaissance” for economic reasons, said Anne Keller, managing director at Midstream Energy Group, an energy consultancy. Keller has worked in the energy and petrochemical industry for more than 30 years. Compared to Ohio and West Virginia, Pennsylvania “far and away shelled out more money,” she said.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_3674-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 13:03:55.439791

Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com, expressed concern over consumer awareness of the impending tax credit deadline, noting that increased interest in EVs hasn’t matched her expectations.
As the fall approaches, there is potential for a wave of disappointment among consumers who may not realize the significance of the tax credit and its expiration.","As the deadline for the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit approaches, car buyers are racing against the clock to take advantage of the incentives before they expire on September 30. The tax credit, which offers up to $7,500 for qualifying electric vehicle purchases, was set to be eliminated under the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, new guidance from the IRS has introduced some flexibility to the deadline.

Buyers now have the option to secure a tax credit as long as they enter into a binding contract for the vehicle before the cut-off date, even if the delivery occurs later. The IRS clarified that a partial payment, such as a nominal down payment or trade-in, is also required to meet eligibility criteria. Although the tax credit won’t be granted until the buyer takes possession of the car, the binding contract condition could significantly ease concerns for shoppers trying to navigate the tight timeline.

Traditionally, the IRS has relied on delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit. For instance, if a vehicle qualified for a credit in one year but not in the following, customers who took delivery on January 1 would miss out on the incentive. However, this recent guidance reflects a shift in approach. Sean Tucker, lead editor at Kelley Blue Book, remarked that this is not entirely new for the IRS, noting that similar language was employed when the rules for claiming the credit adjusted post-Inflation Reduction Act.

This flexibility is expected to benefit those buying vehicles that need to be shipped from another state or custom-ordered vehicles not yet in production. Andy Phillips, vice president of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, emphasized the importance of this added leeway, stating that it could make a significant difference for buyers already aware of which vehicles they want.

Understanding the implications of the federal EV tax credit can be complex, especially given its evolving nature. Unlike typical tax credits, the EV credit can now be applied as an upfront discount at the point of sale. To qualify, new vehicles must adhere to specific price caps and manufacturing criteria, including certain percentages of battery minerals sourced from North America and allied countries. Additionally, buyer eligibility is income-restricted, with limits set at $150,000 adjusted gross income for individuals and $300,000 for married couples.

Several well-known EV models, including offerings from Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Kia, are on the list of vehicles qualifying for this credit. Prospective buyers are advised to confirm with dealers that the specific vehicle in question is eligible, as not all model variants meet the necessary criteria. A separate used vehicle credit allows buyers of EVs over two years old to benefit from up to $4,000, provided the selling price is under $25,000. There is also an advantageous leasing option without restrictions, which has led to mixed reactions among critics and enthusiasts alike.

Despite rapid growth in the EV market between 2020 and 2023, recent months have shown stagnation, with electric vehicles holding steady at approximately 10% market share in the U.S. This plateau has raised concerns among automakers and environmental advocates. With the current administration’s move to roll back various policies promoting EV adoption, including the elimination of tax credits, analysts anticipate an initial surge in EV sales as consumers rush to meet the deadline. Notably, data from Cox Automotive indicates that new EV sales rose nearly 20% year-over-year in July, with used EV sales climbing 40%.

However, many industry experts remain cautious about long-term trends. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com, expressed concern over consumer awareness of the impending tax credit deadline, noting that increased interest in EVs hasn’t matched her expectations.

Read more about the methodology to estimate for offshore wind jobs.","Working people in coastal areas and industrial heartlands are set to benefit from better workforce protection and skilled job opportunities in Britain’s mission to secure clean, homegrown energy.

A Fair Work Charter has been set out in proposals published today (Saturday 23 August) – working with Unions and business – that will require offshore wind developers to pay into a skills fund or spend a minimum amount on skills training in their local communities to support oil and gas workers, apprentices or school leavers move into the UK’s growing offshore wind industry.

Skills training could be provided through education schemes, training facilities, new equipment or work experience and internships, creating new opportunities for working people and unlocking growth across Britain.

Proposals also encourage developers and supply chain firms to create more high-quality, secure jobs in offshore wind, with better access to trade unions and stronger protections on pay and terms and conditions. This could include a commitment to a ‘Fair Worker Charter’ co-developed between industry and trade unions.

As we reach our clean power mission by 2030, offshore wind is estimated to support up to 100,000 jobs, with many jobs outside of London in coastal and rural parts of the country. Industry estimates a typical salary for an offshore wind worker is £10,000 higher than the UK average, with 90% of the UK’s oil and gas workforce having skills that are transferrable into offshore renewables.

These changes will help ensure these jobs are always skilled, secure and well-paid as more of these jobs become available on the clean energy transition providing long-term stability and job opportunities.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

Britain’s clean energy future will be powered by secure, unionised jobs for local people right across the country – from East Anglia to Teesside and Aberdeen.

We’re backing businesses that invest in working people in these communities, securing a route to long-term careers for oil and gas workers, apprentices and school leavers, as we deliver our Plan for Change.

Christina McAnea, General Secretary at UNISON, said:

Clean, homegrown energy is vital to Britain’s future growth and to tackling climate change. A highly skilled, fairly paid and secure clean energy workforce is essential to achieving these goals.

UNISON has long argued that the government needs to invest in retraining existing energy workers so their skills and experience can be transferred to clean energy jobs. Investment in apprenticeships and opportunities for young people is crucial in building the workforce of tomorrow.

This initiative offers a chance to boost skills across the energy sector, create and protect well-paid jobs, and support the renewal of coastal communities and industrial regions. Working together under a Fair Work Charter – unions, government and business – can deliver growth and stronger protection for workers.

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary at RMT, said:

We welcome the commitments to make trade union recognition and strong pro-worker standards a part of offshore wind contracts, covering re-training, protecting pay, and working conditions.

This ensures that oil and gas workers are not being left behind.

Alongside the Employment Rights Bill and wider pledges to strengthen offshore workers’ rights, including for seafarers in the supply chain, the progress so far shows a plan is coming together.

That will give our members confidence that their livelihoods will be protected through these turbulent times.

Sue Ferns OBE, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect, said:

Transitioning to a clean energy future will mean tens of thousands of new jobs being created across the UK, and it is welcome to see a clear commitment from the government that these should be good quality, unionised jobs.

Training the clean energy workforce of tomorrow is one of the biggest challenges we face, and it is only fair that renewables developers that rely on this labour contribute to skills programmes.

While progress has been made on unionisation in renewables, there is still more to do, and Prospect has been calling for the strongest possible signal from government that they expect companies receiving public money or participating in public procurement processes to work with and recognise trade unions.

This comes ahead of the UK’s first ever Clean Energy Workforce Strategy, which will ensure that clean energy jobs are not only widely available, but also high-quality. Offshore wind will be the backbone of Britain’s future energy needs, offering skilled jobs on good wages, and the opportunity to build a varied and fulfilling career.

Offshore wind requires skilled workers across the country in areas such as blade repair, mechanics, wind turbine maintenance, marine spatial planning and health and safety protocols.

But in some parts of the sector workers and trade unions have called for more consistency around workplace standards and trade union access to support these roles. Today’s proposals would ensure the industry is always delivering for its workforce by encouraging them to work in partnership with trade unions to develop stable, long-term jobs.

The measures would be introduced through the Clean Industry Bonus, which provides offshore wind developers with funding on the condition that they build new factories in deprived regions or invest in more sustainable supply chains to drive economic growth.

The consultation will also seek views on the introduction of onshore wind into the Clean Industry Bonus to help turbocharge its deployment in the UK after years of stagnation due to the de-facto ban under the previous government. This follows the government’s launch of the first ever onshore wind strategy earlier this year, and will get the country building again, as the sector is estimated to support up to 45,000 jobs in Great Britain by 2030.

Notes to editors

Earlier this year, the government allocated up to £544 million (2025 prices) through the scheme for offshore wind and partnered with Great British Energy - the UK’s publicly owned clean power company - alongside industry and The Crown Estate, to invest £1 billion in offshore wind supply chains.

These reforms will be included in the government’s flagship renewables auction in 2026, known as Contracts for Difference Allocation Round 8 subject to consultation.

Brazil's ag sector wants to flip climate script

Sao Paulo, 22 August (Argus) — Agriculture and land-use produce the largest share of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions, but the sector is trying to show it plans to clean up its act ahead of the UN Cop 30 summit there later this year. Emissions from agriculture and land-use, which ag contributing the most to the latter, accounted for 74pc of all Brazilian greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2023, according to the latest data from GHG emissions monitoring platform SEEG. The agribusiness sector alone was responsible for over 97pc of all deforested area in the last six years in Brazil, according to land monitoring system MapBiomas. The sector will send observers to Cop 30 to promote its investments to adapt to and mitigate global warming, Brazil's agribusiness confederation CNA executive director Muni Lourenco said. Federal initiatives have pushed agribusiness into the climate action package as part of Brazil's strategy to both reduce climate change and support economic development, which Cop 30's executive director Ana Toni has said she will fight for during the summit. ""Agribusiness can also be part of the climate solution,"" climate and society institute ICS director Maria Netto said during a climate conference recently. Brazil's Caminho Verde program aims at increasing productivity in the agribusiness sector through reforestation and recovering already deforested but unproductive land for planting. Agriculture occupies 280mn hectares in Brazil, of which 165mn are used as pastures and 82mn of those hectares are not considered productive. The program's goal is to recover 40mn lower-producing hectares by 2035, converting them to higher-producing areas without deforesting new lands. Other climate solutions stemming from agricultural practices are Brazil's mandatory biofuel mixes , which recently increased to 30pc of ethanol in gasoline and 15pc of biodiesel in diesel, and clean energy generation from agriculture waste such as sugarcane waste and manure. The biofuels that often come from agricultural feedstock count toward avoided emissions — the reduction that comes from burning this substitute for fossil fuel — but this does not help solve the agriculture industry's emissions problem. Still, the agricultural sector's presence in Brazil's climate action plan mainly stems from Brazil's government putting its foot down so it can try to comply with its nationally determined contribution (NDC). The NDC seeks to cut emissions by 59-67pc from 2005 levels by 2035, equivalent to 850mn-1.05bn tons of CO2 equivalent. The Brazilian NDC also aims at achieving zero liquid emissions — when emissions and carbon capture offset each other — by 2050 through low-carbon agriculture and cattle raising practices and reforestation, among other goals. This works to address the climate impact of its largest economic driver while not alienating the sector . Balancing act Yet agriculture's legislative efforts often clash with executive wishes to strengthen Brazil's climate-friendly image. Earlier in August, Lula partially vetoed a new environmental licensing bill, eliminating most of the items supported by the agricultural sector and coalition of lawmakers from rural states. The final text maintained a special licensing model that fast-tracks primarily agriculture ventures, but blocked the proposals to create a self-licensing procedure for small agriculture projects. Brazilian environment minister Marina Silva had also criticized the original bill because it could block trade deals — such as the EU-Mercosur — that rely on complying to climate pledges. Brazil's business interests will continue to argue that developing countries cannot be held to the same standards as much higher-polluting developed economies. The impact of each country's climate and environment are also key, groups such as CNA say. ""Brazil cannot be put under temperate [climate] standards when it operates under tropical circumstances,"" Lourenco added.

US exempts small refiners from biofuel quotas: Update

Updates throughout New York, 22 August (Argus) — The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today fully or partially granted the majority of small refiners' requests for waivers from federal biofuel blend mandates, while limiting the windfall for newly exempt refiners. The agency fully accepted 63 petitions, offered 50pc relief in response to 77 petitions, denied 28 requests, and determined that 7 were ineligible. Program data shows 13 petitions still pending, mostly from the 2025 compliance year. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits from those that do. Refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d can request hardship exemptions from the mandates, which they have long cast as financially onerous. President Donald Trump's administration had an unprecedented backlog of requests to decide after courts took issue with former president Joe Biden's reasoning for mass denials. While the number of exemptions frustrated biofuel and farm advocates, small refiners that lobbied officials for retroactive compensation were denied more sweeping relief. EPA said on Friday that it would return already-surrendered RINs to newly exempt companies but that only credits from 2023 and later could be used for future compliance. Returned older credits, effectively worthless, ""are not expected to impact demand for biofuels"", the agency said. Because the older credits have no value, EPA does not plan to force oil companies to blend more biofuels to account for those exemptions. But EPA signaled a different approach for more recent years, saying that it planned to account for actual exemptions in 2023 and 2024 and expected exemptions in 2025 when setting future biofuel quotas. The agency said it would ""in the near future"" submit a proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget that will clarify its plan. EPA had already signaled that it would estimate future exemptions when setting biofuel mandates, but accounting for actual exemptions from active compliance years in addition would be a major shift that could increase costs for larger oil companies, if implemented. Program data show that affected small refiners have to submit about 1.4bn fewer RINs across 2023 and 2024 following Friday's exemptions — but companies without exemptions could have to make up that lost volume in the future depending on EPA's pending proposal. The total mandates in those years were 20.9bn RINs and 21.5bn RINs respectively. EPA said Friday it aimed to ensure stability in the often-volatile RIN market, noting that replacing expired credits with active ones would have flooded the market with 3bn more RINs. Current-year D6 ethanol credits rose 4pc and D4 biomass-based diesel credits rose 3pc on Friday, as traders saw EPA's solution to older-vintage credits as limiting supply increases. Biofuel groups, while frustrated that most eligible refiners won at least some relief, expressed cautious optimism about EPA's plan. Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper said Friday's exemptions ""should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use"". But companies will eagerly await more details about EPA's proposal to account for 2023 and 2024 waivers, which could come as soon as next week. EPA has signaled that it wants to finalize new biofuel mandates before November, but that timeline appears ambitious if the agency has to first take comment on a proposal that could drastically shift its formula for setting those mandates. Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biomass-based diesel producers, said that the new plan ""will delay the finalization of the 2026 and 2027 rule"". In a draft regulation earlier this year, EPA proposed record-high biofuel blending for those years. Court fights await Legal challenges are virtually guaranteed. The agency said that its decisions had ""nationwide scope or effect"" — an effort to steer litigation toward one federal circuit court rather than a hodgepodge of regional courts that might issue conflicting rulings. Small refiners denied full relief are likely to challenge the Trump administration's reasoning. EPA said it almost entirely relied on recommendations from the Department of Energy (DOE), which scores individual applications for ""disproportionate economic hardship"" and considers factors like a refiner's output of diesel compared to gasoline and its local market's acceptance of renewables. While EPA is legally required to consult with DOE, the new policy of largely deferring to that department's recommendations would be a major change from recent years. A 2022 study from the US Government Accountability Office concluded that DOE's methodology was ""critically flawed"", and EPA officials at the time told the watchdog agency that DOE's analysis no longer provided useful information. Accepting DOE scores appears to have led to some counterintuitive results, though specific details from applications are kept confidential. Par Pacific's 18,000 b/d Wyoming refinery earned full exemptions for three straight years before losing relief the next. Ergon's 23,000 b/d facility in West Virginia won partial exemptions for 2021 and 2024, but not the years in between. And EPA offered at least some relief to Suncor's 36,000 b/d Commerce City East refinery over six straight years — while denying any relief for four of those years to Suncor's 67,000 b/d Commerce City West refinery at the same Colorado site. ""Not a lot of rhyme or reason to it"", a refining source told Argus . The unpredictability of the exemptions — with essentially all refiners receiving different answers depending on the year — could also make it hard for EPA to estimate future waivers when finalizing biofuel quotas. The agency has received some exemption petitions for 2025 but has yet to decide any for that year or beyond. Large oil refiners will also hotly oppose any effort from EPA to raise their biofuel blending to compensate for their smaller competitors winning exemptions. While some oil companies joined with farm groups this year to push for higher biofuel mandates, the industry has more recently expressed frustration with Trump-backed biofuel policies that they say are boosting feedstock and fuel costs. ""It is inexplicable that EPA is even considering adding more mandated biofuels on top of the largest and most expensive [Renewable Fuel Standard] mandate ever proposed by reallocating exempted volumes"", the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers said.

Brazil updates Cop 30 forest fund plan

Sao Paulo, 22 August (Argus) — Brazil has advanced its Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) initiative, a fund to preserve global tropical forests that will be launched at the UN Cop 30 summit, adding new governance and financing structures. Under the updated plan, TFFF will act through two distinct entities: the Tropical Forest Investment Fund (TFIF), a legally independent investment vehicle, and TFFF itself, hosted initially by the World Bank. The TFIF will blend sponsor capital — 20pc from sovereign and philanthropic sources and 80pc raised via bond issuance to institutional investors. Returns from this portfolio will fund annual payments to participating countries, starting at $4/ha of preserved forest. Payments are subject to an inflation adjustment, capped at 2pc/yr. It aims to raise $25bn in sponsor capital and an additional $100bn in senior market debt. TFIF will ""exclude investments that cause significant environmental impact"", such as those in activities related coal, peat, oil and natural gas. The updated plan also adds that funded countries must maintain deforestation rates below 0.5pc and will face steep payment discounts for forest loss or degradation. Each hectare (ha) deforested could reduce payments by up to 200ha worth of funding, depending on severity. It also includes a canopy coverage threshold of 20–30pc within specific mapping for countries to apply to the fund. That threshold is subject to updated degradation and deforestation discount ratios. It also highlights that TFFF will not generate or issue carbon or biodiversity credits, nor will it replace other existing forest finance initiatives such as REDD+. Instead, it is ""designed to complement, not duplicate, existing programs"". Finally, the TFFF has reduced its repayment term to 30 years — adding a 10-year grace period — and will require that at least 20pc of payments be allocated to indigenous peoples and local communities. Brazil plans to launch TFFF during Cop 30, which it will host in November in northern Para state. Deforestation is one of Brazil's flagship issues for the summit. The TFFF working group expects to conclude the details of the fund's financial model by September.

Incentive to book German Rehden gas storage decreases

London, 22 August (Argus) — The financial incentive to book capacity at the largest German gas storage site Rehden for the remainder of this storage year continues to decrease. Available injection capacity at Sefe's Rehden storage site in combination with maintenance in October have rendered bookings at the storage site unattractive, with a worse outlook each day that passes without additional bookings. Sefe has offered a doubled injection rate of 1.75 GWh/d since 16 July from 882 MWh/d in previous auctions. As of today, the firm had only sold 13.96TWh of capacity out of 44.68TWh of technical capacity. As a result of the increased injection rate on offer, Sefe can only sell 24.6TWh or 55pc of the site's technical capacity. The boosted injection rate did contribute to further bookings at first, but has not done so in recent auctions. It would take 64 days to completely fill a bundle, and given maintenance on 6-24 October at the storage site, if firms were to book capacity today and inject at the increased firm injection rate from Saturday, it would only fill the bundle by 8 November. Factoring in injection days in each month, the average THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.35/MWh. Market participants have indicated that a €1.80-2/MWh spread is needed for them to profitably book and make use of Rehden space. And every day that capacity is not booked brings the required injection period further into November, reducing the incentive. The THE November first-quarter 2026 spread is narrower than that of earlier months, closing at -€0.305/MWh at the last close, much tighter than the THE balance-of-August first-quarter 2026 spread of -€1.87/MWh. But if Sefe were to offer additional injection capacity, this would improve the incentive to book space at the site. Sefe could offer 3.11 GWh/d of injection capacity — which would further reduce the storage capacity it can offer — and still fill the site to 45pc of capacity, in line with Germany's national storage law. This would allow firms to fill a bundle in 36 days, before the start of October maintenance. If a firm were to book capacity today and inject at this rate from Saturday, it would fill the storage space by 28 September. Considering these injection days, the THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.81/MWh, bringing it within the profitable margin. Other storage sites currently more attractive Storage capacity at other storage sites in Germany is currently more attractive to book than at Rehden, when only considering injection rates. Space at the Etzel ESE (Uniper Energy Storage), Epe-L (RWE), Nuttermoor H-5 (EWE), Jemgum H (EWE) and Nuttermoor H-4 (EWE) storage sites is currently more attractive to book than Rehden based on their firm injection rates ( see table ). All these storage sites, where a total of 7.32TWh of capacity is available, currently offer higher firm injection rates per GWh of capacity than Rehden. This does not take into account additional or interruptible injection capacity that might be on offer at the sites. That said, EWE was unable to sell any capacity at Nuttermoor H-4 in an auction on Thursday, the firm told Argus today. The firm had offered 1.36TWh of gas for the remainder of the storage year.

I. Background

Section 129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) directs the Administrator to develop regulations under that section and section 111(d) of the Act to limit emissions of nine air pollutants (particulate matter, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen chloride, lead, mercury, and cadmium) from four categories of solid waste incineration units: municipal solid waste incinerators; hospital, medical, and infectious solid waste incinerators; commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators; and other solid waste incinerators.

On December 1, 2000, the EPA promulgated new source performance standards (NSPS) and EG to reduce air pollution from CISWI units, which are codified at 40 CFR part 60, subparts CCCC and DDDD, respectively. See65 FR 75338. The EPA revised the NSPS and EG for CISWI units on March 21, 2011. See76 FR 15704. Following promulgation of the 2011 CISWI rule, the EPA received petitions requesting that it reconsider numerous provisions in the rule. The EPA granted reconsideration on certain issues and, subsequently, on February 7, 2013, it promulgated a CISWI reconsideration rule. See78 FR 9112. Subsequently, the EPA received petitions to reconsider certain provisions of the NSPS and EG for CISWI units. On January 21, 2015, the EPA granted reconsideration on four specific issues and subsequently, on June 23, 2016, it finalized reconsideration of the CISWI NSPS and EG. See81 FR 40956.

Following promulgation of the June 23, 2016, final action, the EPA received requests from industry stakeholders and implementing agencies to clarify various issues with implementation of the standards. In addition, the EPA identified certain procedural issues, including testing and monitoring issues and inconsistencies within the rules, that required further clarification or correction. To address the issues, the EPA proposed amendments on June 15, 2018, to several provisions of the 2016 CISWI NSPS and EG. See83 FR 28068. On April 16, 2019, the EPA finalized technical amendments to the June 15, 2018, proposal by promulgating clarifying changes and corrections to the 2016 CISWI rule. See84 FR 15846.[ ]

Section 129(b)(2) of the CAA requires states to submit to the EPA for approval state plans and revisions that implement and enforce the EG—in this case, 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD. State plans and revisions must be at least as protective as the EG and become federally enforceable upon approval by the EPA. The procedures for submittal and adoption of state plans and revisions are codified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B.

On May 31, 2017, Florida submitted a state plan to implement and enforce the EG for existing CISWI units in the State, and submitted supplements on December 19, 2017, and February 2, 2018.[ ] In a notice of proposed rulemaking published on June 4, 2018 (83 FR 25633), the EPA proposed to approve Florida's State plan. Additional information concerning Florida's State plan submission and the rationale for the EPA's actions for this final rule are explained in the June 4, 2018, proposed rulemaking. Comments on the proposed rulemaking were due on or before July 2, 2018. The EPA received one comment on the proposed action that is not relevant. The comment is included in the docket to this action.

II. Final Action

The EPA is finalizing approval of Florida's section 129 State plan for CISWI units in the State, as submitted on May 31, 2017, and supplemented on December 19, 2017, and February 2, 2018. The State plan was submitted in full compliance with the requirements of sections 111(d) and 129 of the CAA, and 40 CFR part 60, subparts B and DDDD.[ ] This approval is based on the rationale provided in the NPRM associated with this rulemaking. The EPA's approval is in accordance with the general provisions of plan approval found in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B and 40 CFR part 62, subpart A, and is pursuant to the Agency's role under 42 U.S.C. 7411(d) and 7429(b). The EPA's approval of Florida's State plan is limited to those CISWI units that meet the criteria established in 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD, and grants the State authority to implement and enforce the performance standards and source requirements of the EG, except in those cases where authorities are specifically reserved for the EPA Administrator or his designee. Authorities retained by the EPA Administrator are those listed in 40 CFR 60.2542.

III. Incorporation by Reference

In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference of Florida Administrative Code (FAC) Chapter 62-204.800(9)(f), Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) Units, which became effective in the State of Florida on December 21, 2017. This incorporation establishes emission standards and compliance times for the control of air pollutants from certain CISWI units that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010, or commenced modification or reconstruction after June 4, 2010, but no later than August 7, 2013. FAC Chapter 62-204.800(9)(f), Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) Units, provides details regarding Florida's adoption of the applicability provisions, compliance times, emission guidelines, operational standards, test methods, compliance provisions, monitoring requirements, reporting guidelines, recordkeeping guidelines, and definitions contained in the EPA's emission guidelines for ( printed page 41305) existing CISWI units (40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD). The emissions standards and compliance times established within the Florida State plan are at least as stringent as those required by the EG for existing CISWI units subject to Subpart DDDD. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these materials generally available through the docket for this action, EPA-R04-OAR-2018-0184, at https://www.regulations.gov and at the EPA Region 4 Office (please contact the person identified in the For Further Information Contact section of this preamble for more information). This incorporation by reference has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register as of September 24, 2025, and the plan is federally enforceable under the CAA as of the effective date of this final rulemaking.

IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a 111(d)/129 plan submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. In reviewing 111(d)/129 plan submissions, the EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided they meet the criteria of the CAA and the EPA's implementing regulations. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:

Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget underExecutive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because state plan approval actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866;

Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);

Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);

Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);

Does not have federalism implications as specified inExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;

Is not a significant regulatory action subject toExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and

Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA.

In addition, the Florida State plan for existing CISWI units is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).

This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and the EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 24, 2025. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements ( see section 307(b)(2)).

This credit also extends to used EVs, where a $4,000 tax incentive is currently offered, according to Chase Auto Finance.
Amanda notes that leasing an EV can be especially advantageous, as the tax credits are often applied directly to monthly payments.
The monthly payment for the 2024 Prologue AWD EX was $239 with a $3,199 down payment, whereas the 2025 version requires a staggering $599 monthly payment and a $4,299 down payment.
Bloomberg echoed Amanda’s sentiments, advising consumers that leasing an electric vehicle before tax incentives are stripped away could be a savvy financial move.","As electric vehicle (EV) sales continue to gain momentum in the United States, a new wave of advice is emerging for potential buyers: don’t hesitate to negotiate. In a recent video, TikTok user Amanda (@themanidiway) underscores the importance of haggling, especially in light of the impending cessation of the $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit slated for September 30, 2025. This credit also extends to used EVs, where a $4,000 tax incentive is currently offered, according to Chase Auto Finance.

Amanda argues that the impending expiration of these credits could lead to significant price increases for electric vehicles, making them “extremely unaffordable” for many drivers. She suggests that this shift may trigger a broader transformation in consumer behavior, leading dealerships to reduce their EV inventories as they brace for a drop in demand. With the lucrative credits still in play, dealerships might currently be more inclined to sell EVs at a loss just to clear out their stock.

The interplay between these incentives and leasing options also offers a tantalizing glimpse into potential EV deals for consumers. Amanda notes that leasing an EV can be especially advantageous, as the tax credits are often applied directly to monthly payments. This structure has generated remarkable leasing opportunities, such as a unique deal in Colorado where drivers could lease a Fiat 500e with no down payment and no monthly payments, provided they meet certain credit criteria.

Other vehicles are also attracting attention, albeit with less irresistible offers. For instance, the Honda Prologue, while already a popular choice, has seen its leasing costs more than double from 2024 to 2025. The monthly payment for the 2024 Prologue AWD EX was $239 with a $3,199 down payment, whereas the 2025 version requires a staggering $599 monthly payment and a $4,299 down payment.

Bloomberg echoed Amanda’s sentiments, advising consumers that leasing an electric vehicle before tax incentives are stripped away could be a savvy financial move. The outlet highlights several appealing lease options. For example, the Mercedes-Benz EQB, priced at around $53,000, can be leased for roughly $352 per month, while Hyundai’s 2025 Ioniq 6 is available for $169 a month with a $4,000 down payment over a 24-month term.

For those leaning toward ownership, Amanda suggests exploring lease-to-own agreements, which could potentially allow drivers to negotiate a favorable buyout price after the lease term—especially crucial when federal tax incentives are no longer available. Amanda encourages buyers to leverage their knowledge of the upcoming incentive changes during negotiations, stating that it worked to her advantage in her own experience, leading her to secure a $22,000 discount on her new Audi A6 e-tron premium plus, which she enjoys “very much.”

With the market shifting and incentives fading, it appears that consumers who actively engage in negotiating could benefit significantly as they navigate the evolving landscape of electric vehicle purchases.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tips-for-Haggling-on-Electric-Vehicles-Before-EV-Tax-Credits.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 04:58:45.125105

As the U.S. and global solar markets grapple with the dual forces of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and escalating tariffs, Enphase's strategic positioning—rooted in innovation, operational discipline, and geographic diversification—offers a compelling case for value investors. But can this solar microinverter and energy storage leader rebound in a sector defined by turbulence? Let's dissect the numbers, the strategy, and the risks.

Strong Earnings and Operational Efficiency: A Foundation for Resilience

Enphase's Q2 2025 results underscore its ability to thrive amid headwinds. Revenue of $363.2 million, slightly above expectations, reflects a 2% sequential increase, driven by U.S. and European demand. The company's non-GAAP gross margin of 48.6%—bolstered by IRA tax incentives—掩饰 a more modest 37.2% margin when excluding policy benefits. While tariffs have eroded margins by ~2 percentage points, Enphase's pivot to U.S. manufacturing (shipping 1.41 million microinverters and 46.9 MWh of IQ Batteries domestically) has mitigated exposure to global supply chain shocks.

Operational efficiency is another pillar of strength. Non-GAAP operating expenses fell to $77.8 million in Q2, down from $79.4 million in Q1, while non-GAAP operating income rose to $98.6 million. The company's cash reserves of $1.53 billion and disciplined capital spending ($8.2 million in Q2, down from $14.6 million in Q1) further highlight its financial prudence. Share repurchases of $30 million in Q2 also signal confidence in its intrinsic value.

Strategic Positioning: Navigating Policy and Tariff Risks

Enphase's alignment with the IRA is a double-edged sword. The $50 million safe harbor agreement with a major TPO financier ensures access to tax credits for domestically produced IQ8HC™ Microinverters, shielding it from the 145% tariffs on Chinese battery imports. However, the looming expiration of Section 25D tax credits by 2027 could disrupt the U.S. residential solar market, pushing demand toward TPO models—a segment where Enphase currently holds a weaker market share.

Geographically, Enphase is diversifying its risk. European revenue grew 11% sequentially in Q2, driven by the IQ Battery with FlexPhase in Spain and Germany, and the launch of the IQ Balcony Solar Kit for urban dwellers. This expansion into high-growth markets offsets U.S. headwinds and positions Enphase to capitalize on the EU's green energy transition.

Product Innovation: A Long-Term Growth Engine

Enphase's product pipeline is a testament to its R&D prowess. The fourth-generation Energy System, including the IQ Battery 10C and IQ Meter Collar, addresses key pain points for residential users: energy density, installation efficiency, and grid integration. The Solargraf platform's AI-driven design tools and TPO integrations further streamline operations for installers, enhancing customer retention.

Critically, Enphase is building an ecosystem. By integrating microinverters, batteries, and EV charging solutions, it's positioning itself as a one-stop shop in a fragmented market. This holistic approach not only differentiates Enphase but also creates switching costs for customers, a rare advantage in a sector prone to commoditization.

Market Reaction and Near-Term Risks

Despite these strengths, ENPH's stock has underperformed in 2025, down 12% year-to-date. The Q2 earnings report, which exceeded revenue and EPS expectations, was met with a 3% post-earnings decline, reflecting investor skepticism about near-term visibility. Q3 guidance of $330–370 million in revenue, while conservative, falls below Wall Street's consensus, raising concerns about margin compression from tariffs and the phasing out of IRA benefits.

The company also faces rising competition from Chinese manufacturers and U.S. rivals scaling domestic production. Additionally, the potential shift to TPO models could pressure Enphase's margins if it fails to secure a larger share of the leasing market.

Weighing the Investment Case

For value investors, Enphase presents a paradox: a company with strong fundamentals and a visionary product roadmap, yet burdened by near-term policy risks and sector-wide volatility. The key question is whether its long-term growth potential in solar and energy storage justifies the current discount.

Risks to Consider:

- Policy Uncertainty: The expiration of Section 25D and potential changes to IRA incentives could disrupt U.S. demand.

- Tariff Pressures: Rising import duties may squeeze margins unless U.S. manufacturing scales further.

- Competition: Chinese and U.S. rivals are accelerating innovation and cost reductions.

Catalysts for Growth:

- IRA-Driven Domestic Production: Tax credits and 45X incentives will sustain U.S. manufacturing margins.

- Product Leadership: The IQ Battery 10C and Solargraf platform position Enphase to capture premium pricing.

- Global Expansion: Europe's energy transition and emerging markets offer untapped demand.

Conclusion: A Contrarian Bet on Resilience

Enphase Energy is not a short-term play. Its stock price volatility reflects the sector's turbulence, but its strategic alignment with policy tailwinds, operational discipline, and product innovation suggest a durable long-term story. For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, ENPH offers a compelling value proposition: a company that is not only surviving the current storm but actively building a moat for the future.

However, patience is key. The path to $100+ revenue per share (based on 2025 guidance) will require navigating near-term margin pressures and policy shifts. Those who can stomach the volatility may find Enphase's rebound—a blend of resilience and reinvention—worth the wait.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 04:01:04.733118

According to The New York Times, the Inflation Reduction Act was the biggest climate bill in U.S. history. By the end of 2025, though, many of its tax credits will be eliminated.

Upgrading your home and taking advantage of these credits sooner rather than later could mean saving thousands of dollars.

Shoppers who act fast can still make eco-friendly updates and save because many of the clean appliance rebates from the IRA are still available. One of the most attractive rebates to take advantage of is the induction stove tax credit.

The size of the credit is based on household income. Low-income households could get 100% of their costs covered after installing an induction range, but savings can be significant across the board.

""Moderate-income households (essentially everyone else who is eligible for the rebates) could get up to 50% of their costs covered,"" the Times explained. Eligible households can save up to $840 on an Energy Star-approved induction cooktop or range.

Unlike gas stoves, induction burners do not emit harmful pollutants indoors. So, switching to an induction stove is an easy, affordable way to improve indoor air quality.

Gas ranges have been linked to increased respiratory problems such as asthma, according to research published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society.

Induction stoves aren't just better for air quality, though. They're also more practical and user-friendly, as they cook food faster, conserve energy, and are easier to clean.

Induction converts say they save time and energy in the kitchen, which is a win for consumers and the environment. Reducing household energy consumption helps decrease the amount of harmful heat-trapping gases entering the atmosphere.

For renters or those who want to test drive induction burners, there are options for switching to induction.

Plug-in induction burners are a great way to try induction without a kitchen renovation or committing to a new stove.

But the new documentary The Nuclear Future argues nuclear is the solution to this country’s rapidly expanding energy needs – demands fueled in part by the sudden expansion of AI, which requires tremendous amounts of electricity for data centers. The film, premiering September 15 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, is directed by award-winning filmmaker Evan Mascagni (Building a Bridge, Circle of Poison) and narrated by actor Boyd Holbrook (Narcos, Logan). After the Kennedy Center premiere, the documentary will go on a nine-state tour of 14 college campuses, “where cutting-edge research is underway and future scientists and engineers are currently studying.”

Watch the trailer for The Nuclear Future below.

“The film follows young advocates and business leaders as they advocate for the expansion of nuclear power in America, where energy demand is surging due to factors including the construction of AI data centers,” notes a synopsis. “The added demand has raised questions about the reliability of America’s existing electric grid to support such increases. The advocates must overcome the power source’s controversial past, as they tackle policy and financial challenges to unlock its transformative potential as a clean baseload energy source.

“The Nuclear Frontier offers a rare, behind-the-scenes look at how industry, technology and policy are converging to shape America’s next energy chapter, particularly as the country competes against China for leadership in nuclear’s zero-carbon technology. The United States has built just two nuclear reactors in the past 30 years, while China has built 37 in just 10 years and has another 30 under construction.”

According to a release, the documentary was filmed at locations including Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California, the University of South Carolina, and Washington DC “that help tell the story of the movement toward more nuclear power.”

Director Evan Mascagni is a convert to the pro-nuclear cause.

“For years, I was opposed to nuclear energy, but I couldn’t fully explain why,” the filmmaker said in a statement. “After I was approached to make this film and began to seriously explore the issues, my perspective changed. I came to realize that embracing nuclear energy, along with wind and solar, may be one of the most effective ways to give my daughter and her generation a real chance at inheriting a planet that hasn’t been devastated by climate change.”

In 2020, the Department of Energy predicted that Appalachia was “on the cusp of an energy and petrochemical renaissance” fueled by abundant shale gas. The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.

“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.

For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction, and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility — first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities — was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant — which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates — is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.

Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”

What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility.

“Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.

As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise, and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of at least 25 years.

Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.

Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.

“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.

Shell’s tax ‘windfall’ in Pennsylvania

Shell’s tax breaks from the state are behind its decision to push forward with the project even as other companies walked away from the “renaissance” for economic reasons, said Anne Keller, managing director at Midstream Energy Group, an energy consultancy. Keller has worked in the energy and petrochemical industry for more than 30 years. Compared to Ohio and West Virginia, Pennsylvania “far and away shelled out more money,” she said.

In 2016, then-vice president of Shell’s Appalachia Petrochemicals Division, Ate Visser, acknowledged the role the subsidies played in its decision-making. “I can tell you, hand to my heart, that without the fiscal incentives, we would not have taken this investment decision,” he said.

Those incentives help to explain how Shell ended up stranded in a region that turned out not to make sense for petrochemical buildout in the current market.

Keller said Pennsylvania’s gift to Shell is unprecedented in the industry. “I’ve literally never heard of anything like that. It was just stunning,” she said. “The state got dealt.”

While there was some greater economic advantage to the region during construction, when more than 9,000 workers were needed, once the plant became operational and the workforce shrank to 500, “the state might as well have just put people in an office and written them a check,” Keller said. Essentially, she said, the financial benefit to the company is so large that the state is effectively off-setting the cost of all full-time employees at Monaca with the tax break.

Edwards, the company spokesperson, said Shell currently employs about 500 people in Monaca and “regularly averages” approximately 400 contractors at the site. Four hundred is the minimum number of permanent jobs required by the state’s tax agreement with Shell.

In 2012, the year the state legislature passed the $1.65 billion tax credit, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s industry and labor secretary, Julia Hearthway, said she was convinced that the Shell plant would “kickstart a chemical manufacturing boom.”

“And with it comes jobs. Not a few hun­dred jobs. Not one com­pany hir­ing 300 or 400 jobs. But thou­sands and thou­sands of jobs to Pennsylvania,” she told StateImpact Pennsylvania.

At one point, the Corbett administration claimed the Shell plant would spawn 20,000 permanent jobs directly and indirectly, because it would draw so many people to move to Beaver County. The administration said Shell would build its plant in another state if Pennsylvania didn’t offer enough incentives.

That same year, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center called the tax breaks “a windfall” for Shell and said the deal was expensive for taxpayers while creating few permanent jobs. That warning now appears prescient.

The economic boom and thousands of new jobs that were supposed to follow in Shell’s wake have failed to materialize, according to research conducted by the Ohio River Valley Institute.

“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened,” said Eric de Place, a research fellow at ORVI who has studied Shell Monaca. De Place’s analysis found that Beaver County’s population has declined since 2012, and it has not seen growth in jobs, GDP, or businesses.

“There’s simply no way to look at economic performance and say, ‘Beaver County got this petrochemical plant and it flourished.’ In fact, it is declining relative to the U.S. and Pennsylvania, and it has not outperformed the counties around it,” he said. “I think you look at the scoreboard and you say, this was a terrible investment of taxpayer money.”

Stier said of Shell’s change of course, “The real driver of this is corporate strategy. Fifteen years ago, Shell was going in a different direction.

“It just goes to show you how big global companies can change their strategies pretty quickly.

Just like the capital project, the upgrades in question would have no additional tax impact on Forestville’s school taxes.

The district is pursuing a Clean Green Energy Project through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to install HVAC systems and mechanical upgrades throughout the district. The project, totaling $7,466,977, would be entirely covered by state aid, grants and NYSERDA funding.

The project would be funded by a NYSERDA grant of $945,377 and $100,000 in utility rebates, with the remaining cost of over $6.4 million to be offset by New York State Building Aid.

Superintendent Dr. John O’Connor initially spoke on the matter in January. “We thought it was too good to be true,” O’Connor said at the time. In the months since, Forestville felt comfortable with the project’s scope and funding opportunities in order to proceed.

The only downside for the district is that in order for the work to be covered at no tax impact, voters would need to approve the project — the second substantial building project in less than two years.

The project will be up for a public vote Thursday, Oct. 16 from 1 until 8 p.m. in the Middle/High School lobby. Absentee ballots are available at the District Clerk’s office. Military ballot applications must be received by the District Clerk by 5 p.m. Sept. 22.

While the work would be covered by grants and state aid, it would still first need to be borrowed by the district. The total cost of the project combined with the previously approved Capital Project now surpasses $19 million, but it would still not require a tax increase. Voters approved the Capital Project by a vote of 128-31. Since then, the district approved a school tax levy increase of 2.3% this year, after no tax increase in back-to-back years. The increase of 2.3% was the most the district could request without exceeding the tax cap.

The already-approved Capital Project includes various maintenance upgrades both inside and out of multiple District facilities. The improvements include a repair of the cafeteria’s outside wall; a front entrance renovation at the Elementary School to mitigate flooding concerns; brick repointing at each of the District’s main buildings to address water damage; locker room upgrades at both buildings; and an upgrade to the Middle/High School Weight Room to provide access for the community after school hours.

Many other areas were also targeted as part of the initial planning phase of the proposal, including a major heating and cooling system, but it was deemed too cost-prohibitive for the District to pursue with all of the other needs. The additions through the Clean Green Energy Project would address many of those needs.

As part of the proposed Clean Green Energy Project, the district would install new rooftop units at both schools to address heating, air conditioning, and air quality in classrooms, cafeterias, music rooms, and gymnasiums. The project would also replace windows on the second and third floors of the Middle/High School to reduce energy loss. Electrical upgrades will improve efficiency, as well.

Addressing heating and cooling systems in schools is a more prevalent concern than ever now that the Heat Mitigation in Public Schools legislation takes effect Sept. 1. The law requires districts to adhere to statewide guidelines for temperatures in classrooms and other district spaces. The proposed upgrades to the district’s facilities would address such concerns.

“This is a tremendous opportunity for our district to modernize our buildings, meet environmental standards, and enhance learning environments — all without placing a burden on local taxpayers. I encourage all residents to participate in the vote and help us shape a healthier future for the Forestville school community,” O’Connor said.

A proposed GST recast in India, aiming to boost the small car market by lowering taxes on ICE vehicles, could inadvertently hinder the growth of the electric car sector. With reduced price advantages, EVs, particularly small models, may face increased competition, potentially slowing their adoption despite current high growth and government targets for EV sales by 2030.

The Indian electric vehicle (EV) sector, particularly the small car and hatchback segment, may soon face a speed bump. The proposed goods and services tax (GST) recast could boost the small passenger car market. Small cars are likely to be placed in the 18% tax slab, substantially reducing the tax burden on them, as per a recent ET report based on information from sources. Small cars of 4 metres and less in length and engine capacity up to 1,200 cc (petrol, CNG and LPG) now attract 28% GST and 1% cess. Large cars and SUVs are likely to face the special rate of 40%, sources told ET. Currently, these vehicles attract 43-50% tax, which includes GST and cess. There will likely be no change in the GST rate for electric vehicles (EV), currently at 5%, the sources said.

The tax recast, if it indeed results in such major cuts in taxes on small cars and hatchbacks, can have an unintended impact. Electric cars, particularly small ones and hatchbacks, will lose a substantial edge over ICE (internal combustion engine) cars.

A recent report by HSBC Investment Research says EV manufacturers might face a competitive setback with such a tax recast. While ICE vehicles will get a boost with lower prices, it would also undercut the price advantage of EVs, potentially slowing their adoption in India.

India’s GST framework is a key policy tool in shaping consumer choices in the automotive sector. The current GST rate for small ICE cars is 28%, with additional cess in some cases, while EVs enjoy a much lower GST of just 5%, a policy crafted to promote clean mobility and reduce oil dependence and urban pollution. This tax differential has been one of the major demand drivers for EVs in India, especially in the cost-sensitive small car segment. A reduction in GST for ICE cars, particularly in the entry-level category, will alter the total cost of ownership equation and potentially reverse some of the recent gains made by electric hatchback models.

India's electric cars are on a high growth path

Live Events

Though India has made big strides in the EV sector, its electric cars are still at a nascent stage. Electric passenger vehicle retail sales jumped 93 % year-on-year in July, led by Tata Motors, as per the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). Total electric passenger vehicle registrations rose to 15,528 units last month as compared with 8,037 units in the year-ago period, it said. However, these sales are dominated by vehicles other than cars. EV growth in India has been led by two and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year. Sales of four-wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019.

India aims to achieve a 30% share of electric vehicles in total vehicle sales by 2030. As per the Aayog, with 18.78 million EV sales in 2024 or just 7.6% of total vehicle sales, the country needs to accelerate significantly to meet its 2030 targeting which will require an increase of over 22% in the next five years. The overall EV sales bump will of course help electric cars too especially when so many attractive, in terms of looks, efficiency and price, have started flooding the market.

The share of electric vehicles in new car sales expanded at a rapid pace in the first five months of this calendar year, as new products from automakers such as Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, MG Motor and Hyundai boosted sales that had slowed down the previous year. EVs accounted for 3.7% in the January-May period, compared with 2.2% in 2023, show industry data. Automotive industry insiders have told ET the launch of new EV models with longer range and enhanced features, expansion of charging infrastructure and a reduction in price differential with fossil fuel-powered vehicles have boosted demand for electric vehicles in India.

Customers now have more vehicles to choose from; as many as 16 EV models are currently available to purchase, compared with 10 in 2023. While several of the new vehicles travel a longer distance than the older models on a single charge, the number of charging stations has more than doubled to 26,311 from 12,146 in the same period, as per Bureau of Energy Efficiency data, reducing range anxiety. Industry executives predict the growth to pick up in coming years.

Will the GST recast slow down electric cars?

Though electric cars are on a high growth path, the challenges still remain formidable. The share of electric vehicles in overall car sales has inched up in the last six months, but customers are opting for them largely as second or third vehicles limiting widespread adoption in the local market, a top executive at the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki has said. Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki, said, “The share of electric cars in total sales of passenger vehicles increased to 4.5% (in July) from about 2.5% last year. But the base is still small. Customers are mostly buying EVs as second or third cars, not as the first one. It is a chicken-and-egg situation, till the time an adequate public charging network is in place, customers are unlikely to use electric cars as a primary vehicle.” Low utilisation of public charging stations, on the other hand, makes it difficult for operators to invest in further expansion.

While Maruti Suzuki is focusing on setting up charging networks to smoother intra-city commute for customers, Korean rival Hyundai has announced plans to beef up the number of charging stations on major highways to make hassle-free inter-city travel for EV owners.

However, despite efforts to boost electric car adoption, the segment is still at a nascent stage. A tax roadbump can stymie its pace of growth.

Electric car manufacturers may find it hard to enjoy as much price premium as their vehicles currently command. Entry-level car segment is extremely price-elastic. A 5% to 8% swing in final pricing can tilt purchasing decisions significantly especially when entry-level buyers are more conscious about limitations of electric cars. Also, many entry-level EVs compromise on range, features or performance compared to their ICE counterparts. If price parity narrows, consumers may lean towards more familiar ICE models. Despite lower running costs, the higher upfront cost of EVs has remained a barrier for mass adoption. A smaller tax differential might reduce the financial incentive for choosing an electric car.

While the possible GST cut on ICE small cars will be very much beneficial for mass consumers as well as the broader automotive industry when India needs to spur consumption as well as economic growth, it might undercut the nascent electric car industry as an unintended consequence.

Yet, at a time when India is building an ecosystem of battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure and supply chain localisation, and competition hardens between electric car makers, EV policy incentives are likely to phase out or stagnate because a developed EV landscape will result in better economic and price efficiencies. However, the possible tax differential resulting from the GST recast might impact growth in the immediate future as the HSBC report points out.

For me, fighting climate change is more than a passion, it is a religious calling.
But my advocacy came at a high cost — in 2008, NAE fired me after an interview where I called for climate change action and expressed support for civil unions.
I continue to speak about the need to combat climate change because the cost of denialism is much too high.","Denialism — when people deny the existence or validity of a provable truth — is not just alive and well in the nation, it is a daily occurrence.

Think about how government officials deny the accuracy of labor statistics, the reality that tariffs are taxes on Americans, the safety of vaccines and the benefits of water fluoridation.

And let’s not forget the dishonesty about the Epstein files, which in effect, is a denial of the sexual trafficking of hundreds of girls and young women, some as young as 14. There is “truth decay,” as the nonprofit public policy group the RAND Corporation calls it.

Denialism of climate change is now official federal policy, and already, the first steps pose an existential threat to the nation — and the world as we know it. The Department of Energy in July released a report, “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,” written by five scientists known for their denial of climate change.

This specious report came the same day the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal to overturn a key 2009 legal ruling giving the federal government authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and other sources. Without this essential legal underpinning, the Trump administration will be able to roll back or repeal 31 key environmental rules advancing clean air, clean water and climate change mitigation almost overnight.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin proclaimed that this proposal would “amount to the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

This glib statement is good news for the oil industry executives to whom Trump promised a windfall in exchange for $1 billion in industry contributions to his campaign, but for the rest of the country, it is dire news.

Without environmental regulations, air and water pollution will increase, climate change will accelerate and there will be more devastating fires, floods, deadly heat waves, hurricanes and other extreme weather events. This will result in more foodborne diseases; respiratory illnesses, cancers and other serious health problems; burned-out or flooded communities; higher insurance costs; billions spent on disaster relief and thousands of preventable deaths.

As the son of a fruit farmer growing up in Quincy, I experienced in a deeply personal way the links between climate, energy and the economy. Farmers can attest to the impact of climate on their crops and their livelihoods. The looming reality of climate change should be of concern to everyone.

For me, fighting climate change is more than a passion, it is a religious calling.

As vice president of the National Association of Evangelicals in the early 2000s, I spoke out often and loudly about the need for Creation Care, gave a sermon at the National Cathedral on Earth Day, taught at Christian colleges and churches, authored articles, lobbied Congress and even appeared in documentaries.

But my advocacy came at a high cost — in 2008, NAE fired me after an interview where I called for climate change action and expressed support for civil unions.

Yes, I reeled from being fired, but NAE’s action did not defeat me. I continue to speak about the need to combat climate change because the cost of denialism is much too high.

George Orwell said, “However much you deny the truth, the truth goes on existing, as it were, behind your back.”

The truth behind our backs is that climate change is undeniable, it is happening right now and ending environmental protections will only make things worse — and fast.

There is another important truth: “We the people” can do something to preserve our environment. The administration must seek and review public comments on its proposals. The EPA has extended the public comment period to Sept. 22 for its proposal to repeal the 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment finding. (Instructions for commenting are at st.news/rule).

Don’t sit on the sidelines. Speak out, submit comments, contact your congressional representative or send a letter to the president.

This is a fight worth winning — for all of us.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08202025_tzr_tzr_215656.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-23 14:03:23.429617

“Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities.
Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totaled approximately 4 million labor union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind,” they continued.
Revolution Wind is the third project halted by the Trump administration this year.
In April, the Interior Department also halted the Empire 1 Wind project off the coast of Long Island, N.Y.","The Trump administration on Friday issued an order stopping all activities of a wind energy project in Rhode Island that could have supplied electricity to 350,000 homes.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in a letter sent to Ørsted, the Danish company operating the project, said the stop work order seeks “to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas.”

“You may not resume activities until BOEM informs you that BOEM has completed its necessary review,” the letter added.

The Revolution Wind Project, a $1.5 billion plan, approved under former President Biden is 80 percent complete and projected to be finished by 2026, according to Ørsted. The company says it’s “fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits.”

Friday’s order is the latest move by the Trump administration to dismantle wind and solar projects. Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which heavily limits incentives for renewable energy enacted in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

On top of that, the Interior Department announced last month that it would conduct strict review processes for all wind and solar projects. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s office said this would include decisions on grants, environmental impact and land leases.

This week, the administration also launched a national security probe into imports of wind turbines. Why wind turbine imports are considered a national security problem remains unclear. However, the administration requested comments from the public about the impact of foreign government subsidies, among other topics.

“Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including U.S. shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states,” the company said in a statement.

“Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totaled approximately 4 million labor union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind,” they continued.

The project was approved in 2023 and had a 20-year power purchase agreement. When fully built, the project could have provided electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. In May, the Attorney General of Connecticut, William Tong, and 17 other AGs sued the administration over its attempts to restrict wind projects.

“Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings,” the company said on Friday.

The Interior Department did not immediately respond to The Hill’s requests for comment.

Ørsted has another wind project in Rhode Island, named South Fork, which was approved in 2021 and also part of the Biden administration’s aim to start the clean energy transition.

Revolution Wind is the third project halted by the Trump administration this year. In early August, the Interior Department reversed Biden’s approval for the Lava Ridge Wind Project in Idaho, which could have supplied 500,000 homes with electricity.

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Burgum said in the press release early August.

In April, the Interior Department also halted the Empire 1 Wind project off the coast of Long Island, N.Y.

1. Why Can’t the U.S. Build 5-Minute E.V. Chargers? — The New York Times

China is dominating the EV market with 70% of global manufacturing in 2024. Two major Chinese EV companies have already announced a 5-minute charger.

However, car buyers in the US aren’t likely to get access to 5-minute chargers anytime soon. China has already pulled a generation or two ahead on the technology, and very few Chinese-branded cars are sold in the US because of tariffs. China treats EV charging stations as critical infrastructure, much like the US does highway maintenance. They build charging hubs directly into the grid, unlike the US.

China invested upfront in its charging network, before there was a market. They saw it coming, now they’ve pulled ahead and left others behind.

2. Will Oil Demand Peak Soon? Trump Administration Doesn’t Want to Hear It. — The New York Times

The latest International Energy Agency, or IEA, forecasts have shown oil and gas demand could peak by the end of this decade as EV sales grow, and the cost of solar and storage plummets. The projected peak in demand is partly because China’s appetite for oil is leveling off as they shift from oil to battery-powered transportation. BloombergNEF and oil companies like BP and Equinor have also projected a peak in oil use by around 2030.

Others, like Exxon Mobil and OPEC, believe oil will see continued growth in the coming decades.

ERCOT says electricity usage may rise 62% in 2030 from its current record. Data centers, crypto-mining facilities and factories are planned to be built in Texas, and renewables are slated to provide the power. 94% of new power capacity added to the Texas grid since 2020 has come from renewables or batteries. Texas has more clean energy and batteries than any other state, supplying more than 30% of its electricity.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” ends tax credits for these types of projects starting in 2028, making them more expensive to build. Texas officials have tried to encourage construction of natural gas plants, but cost uncertainties and a global turbine shortage have made it a challenge. The state’s booming economy is at stake if it can’t add more electricity generation.

Solar panels that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years, and are now gaining traction in the U.S. The systems are about the size of a door, and can be mounted on the balcony of an apartment or in a backyard. This is especially appealing right now considering rooftop solar tax credits are set to expire, and some homeowners can’t afford the upfront cost of rooftop solar. One plug-in solar customer saw $35 savings per month on their electricity bill. The smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.

In fact, a recent study confirmed that hands-free driving is now the most in-demand feature in new cars.","Rivian says it plans to have hands-free point-to-point driver assistance available in late 2026.

This will eventually lead to the brand's roll-out of an eyes-off, truly autonomous system at a later date.

CEO RJ Scaringe believes that autonomy will be an unintentional driver of electric cars.

Let’s be honest, half the folks out there with driver-assistance systems out there probably aren’t treating them like they should be anyway. They’re texting or sneaking in some Tiktoks while peeling back the wrapper on a Taco Bell burrito. I know this, you know this and Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe certainly knows it too. That’s one of the reasons that the brand is so hell-bent on getting that whole pesky autonomy thing figured out

It turns out that Rivian is on the “precipice” to introducing a more mature hands-free driving system in its trucks, and it’s coming a lot sooner than you think. In a recent interview with InsideEVs, Scaringe shared that the brand is not only on-track to delivering hands-free driving on both city streets and highways, with point-to-point driving available in 2026. But Scaringe believes the company will eventually deliver point-to-point eyes-off autonomy as well.

""We're at the precipice of starting to see the delivery of capabilities that map to all this infrastructure that we built. First was hands-free. The obvious next step is hands-free everywhere. Then the next step is the vehicle can drive itself point-to-point, you know, address to address,"" said RJ during the interview. He acknowledged that the timeline could be a bit dicey, though:

""It's hard to be overly precise on [a timeline], honestly. You can see why you can you can get the dates wrong on this. But we've said is in 2026 we'll be hands-free point-to-point. We're going to show some of this at our autonomy day. Then we'll increasingly start to allow eyes off.""

The point that RJ is trying to make is that self-driving is at this awkward phase in its lifecycle. Automakers see the value in bringing self-driving into the forefront of the modern car, but actually achieving autonomy is a hard task that has equated to a giant cash burn for most brands out there today (as many automakers very well know).

You can’t actually buy a self-driving car today. In industry terms, cars are technically still Level 2, meaning you’re supposed to be paying attention to what’s going on around you because the car isn’t driving—you are. But everyone is treating it like it’s Level 3 anyway and they’re free to sneak a peek away from the road to answer a text.

Rivian’s pitch here is to cut out the charade. Let the car actually do the driving and stop pretending that the meat sack behind the wheel is paying attention.

""One of the unspoken things about self-driving systems—especially in personally-owned vehicles—most systems are level two, meaning you, as the driver, are supposed to be attentive to the road and paying attention as a redundant layer but not actually driving the vehicle,” said RJ. “The way that this is often measured is your hand on the wheel or your eyes on the road. So what happens is, as we well know, you put your hand on the wheel, but you're still texting. This is very, very common. And so it's just a workaround to treat your level two as if it's a level three.""

It’s not just a convenience thing either. Ask Tesla, GM or any other automaker out there, and they’ll tell you that the industry is trending towards personal autonomy being the next big thing. In fact, a recent study confirmed that hands-free driving is now the most in-demand feature in new cars.

That makes the road to personal autonomy one driven by business and not just another tech bro looking to prove that their company can be the first one to do it.

RJ says that he believes Tesla’s head start in autonomy is one of the reasons that it was able to gain so much traction for its vehicles so quickly. He also credits the tech for driving demand not just for Tesla, but for EVs in general, and believes that the consumer push for the tech will push forward EVs as a whole by the end of the decade.

""I do think that as we get to the end of this decade, like as we get to like 2030-2031, the ability to have hands off, eyes off in most situations is going to become very valuable and will start to drive a lot of purchase decisions,"" said RJ. ""I think it could help accelerate—by coincidence—electrification because I think this is most likely to be seen on electric vehicles.

Long-term, it’s clear that autonomy is a sales hook for every automaker out there. If you’re not with it, you’re going to get left behind. And, let’s be real, if your neighbor is rocking a new ride that lets them turn their commute into more me-time than traffic, you start looking at your lane-keeping like it’s a pretty dumb feature in comparison.

“The United States continues to face an energy emergency, with some regions experiencing more capacity constraints than others,” Wright said in extending the order. “With electricity demand increasing, we must put an end to the dangerous energy subtraction policies embraced by politicians for too long.”

The power system is under unprecedented stress from the digital economy, as it tries to keep up with demand for cloud computing and artificial intelligence data centers — and prepare for voracious demand growth through 2030.

In a second order directing Consumers Energy and the Midwest grid operator to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, running through November, Wright deployed a nearly century-old law written for wartime use. Wright extended his original order in May that kept the plant open.

“The emergency conditions that led to the issuance of the original order persist,” Wright said.

But in hewing to Trump’s personalized understanding of the grid’s challenges, Wright risks ignoring the full range of stresses ahead, say electricity experts, issues that can’t be solved just by keeping old power plants running.

Wright again Thursday pointed an accusing finger at wind and solar power.

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining,” Wright said.

Grids serving Texas and huge swaths of the middle of the country use significant amounts of renewable energy to keep the lights on, with utilities and big technology companies building or purchasing more. California has installed large amounts of energy storage to enable its supply of renewable power.

The decisive action to keep the J.H. Campbell plant running contrasts dramatically with the snail-paced regulatory changes that have guided an industry that abhors surprises.

“Everything we do in the energy space takes too long — 10 years or more,” said Jeff Weiss, executive director of Distributed Sun, a solar energy developer, speaking at a U.S. Energy Association event this week. “We need to figure out how to do everything in two years,” he added, “and it’s critical to our economy.”

Yet whether an imminent emergency exists that would justify federal intervention into electricity markets is widely disputed — and pinned mostly on the Trump administration’s political calculations.

There is no imminent shortage of electricity, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) declared in a lawsuit challenging the original DOE order keeping the J.H. Campbell plant running.

The attorney general’s challenge to the DOE order cited the authority of states to oversee power generation and utility rates. The Michigan Public Service Commission and the region’s grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, both agreed to the closure.

The Trump energy policy

The executive order and lawsuit thrust the Midwest grid’s reliability challenges into a politically charged confrontation.

The foundation of Trump’s energy policy seems to boil down to four assertions: Power grids can only meet Big Tech’s artificial intelligence ambitions if they rely heavily on fossil fuels. Electrifying a limitless number of data centers is a matter of national security. Wind and solar power aren’t reliable sources of electricity. And lastly, U.S. policy should reflect the president’s hostility toward non-nuclear clean energy sources that benefited from former President Joe Biden’s climate policy.

“Energy dominance,” in Trump’s first year, translates to more natural gas, new nuclear reactors built sometime in the 2030s — and whatever existing coal plants the administration can keep from closing today.

Wright cited his department’s grid reliability study in July warning that power outages across the U.S. could increase by 100 times in 2030 “if the U.S. continues to take reliable power offline” — and just as the tech industry’s need for electricity spirals upward. DOE’s worst-case scenario holds that 104,000 megawatts of older coal and gas plants nationwide could retire by 2030, creating a supply crisis.

But that threat analysis assumes that data centers will require more than 50,000 megawatts of new generating capacity, most of it running around the clock for months at a time as it processes enormous AI workloads.

That figures are guesswork, at best, grid experts say. And companies operating in the power markets won’t build if they can’t count on a guaranteed, long-term electricity supply.

“No credible data center developer is going to break ground on a large data center without confidence in 24/7 electricity,” says John Moura, director of reliability assessment and performance analysis for the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC).

How much to build?

The demands for more power keep coming.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Tom Falcone, president of the Large Public Power Council. “We know that there’s a lot to build. How much exactly?”

Developers’ requests to hook new power plants into grid systems have choked interconnection queues. “Is it all needed?” Falcone asked.

States and utilities are pressing for longer-term financial commitments from data centers and others requesting a lot of electricity. “That is the balancing act when you’re in a large build-out,” Falcone said.

Further, clean energy advocates say that the administration’s eagerness to single out the risks of wind and solar generation during severe weather misses another critical point. The DOE grid emergency analysis uses historical weather patterns to estimate power needs during periods of stress. But in line with Trump’s views, DOE chose not to examine the severity and frequency of extreme weather as climate change worsens over time — threatening natural gas infrastructure and other conventional sources of power.

NERC’s most recent grid reliability assessment does consider the future, examining which hours of the year extreme cold or heat would put the grid at greatest stress. Those risk factors also apply to natural gas, the largest source of electricity generation.

NERC Chief Executive Jim Robb told a FERC conference in June that grid operators need “much deeper insight” into the probabilities of extreme storms and heat waves that could push power demand to new peaks. Current industry risk analysis is not adequate, Robb said.

“This will require stronger modeling of fuel and capacity performance to assess reliability risk,” Robb said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/9d/1d/1d978ab84bc8b3c09111219c7a73/unlimiteduse-03-19-2025-white-house-isp-012.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 05:00:20.776367

“Frequent changes to incentives and shifting targets erode confidence,” the report warns, urging policymakers to provide “stable signals” to support domestic production and investment.

The study, Europe’s Car Industry in Transition: Stuck in Neutral or Shifting into Gear?, warns that “standing still is not an option” for Europe’s carmakers as the global industry pivots to battery-electric vehicles. It argues that slowing the shift to EVs “does not stabilise the industry – it accelerates its decline.”

While the report focuses on the EU, its findings highlight challenges that are particularly acute for the UK. Car production in Britain has fallen to its lowest level since 1954, with post-Brexit supply chain disruption, rapidly escalating EV mandates, and inconsistent policy signals weighing on manufacturers.

“The problem isn’t demand,” the authors note, citing growing consumer interest in EVs across Europe. Instead, they argue, the real barrier is cost: average battery-electric vehicle prices in the Eurozone remain around 22% higher than comparable petrol models, a gap driven by manufacturers’ focus on premium offerings rather than affordable mass-market cars.

Several EU nations have begun to address this through coordinated industrial policy. Poland’s early investment in battery manufacturing has “sparked a regional cluster,” while France’s “Battery Valley” and Spain’s EV recovery schemes have attracted billions in investment. By contrast, the UK risks being isolated from these emerging value chains.

“National efforts can succeed,” the report says, “but without a broader ecosystem, they cannot compete with global leaders like China,” whose dominance in batteries and low-cost EVs poses a growing threat.

Last Friday, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) determined that the cost of keeping the plant online would be shared across MISO regions.
According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data cited by the DOE in its latest order, the Campbell Plant generated approximately 664,000 MWh over the month of June, running at a 61% capacity factor.","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has extended an emergency order that would keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired plant in operation until November 19, 2025, due to concerns about reliability in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region.

Consumers Energy had planned to close the plant by May 31 of this year as part of a transition to cleaner energy. But DOE intervened just days earlier, saying the plant must remain open, at least until August 21, because of possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.

“The summer season has not yet ended, and the production of electricity from the Campbell Plant will continue to be a critical asset to maintain reliability in MISO this summer,” reads the DOE extension order from this week. “That need is evidenced by the fact that the Campbell Plant was called on by MISO to generate large amounts of electricity during the heat wave that hit MISO this past June.”

J.H. Campbell is a three-unit, 1,560 MW coal-fired plant in West Olive, Michigan. Its first unit came online in 1962. Eight utility commissions, along with several environmental groups, challenged DOE’s initial emergency order.

Keeping the plant online after May cost Consumers Energy $29 million between May and June 2025, according to the utility’s latest quarterly filings. Consumers said it has continued to make J.H. Campbell available and is seeking cost recovery of the $29 million through FERC and a proposed MISO Tariff modification. Last Friday, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) determined that the cost of keeping the plant online would be shared across MISO regions.

According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data cited by the DOE in its latest order, the Campbell Plant generated approximately 664,000 MWh over the month of June, running at a 61% capacity factor.

MISO, which manages the flow of electricity in the central U.S., has said it should have adequate generating capacity this summer but faces “significant uncertainty” in overall resource adequacy projections.

Last month FERC approved MISO’s Expedited Resource Addition Study (ERAS), a temporary process designed to quickly bring up to 68 new generation projects online to address urgent load growth and reliability challenges. The program, which sunsets in 2027, ensures projects meet specific adequacy needs verified by state regulators, while aligning with long-term interconnection reforms.

However, DOE noted that “resources studied under the ERAS will have commercial operation dates that are at least three years away, and are provided an additional three year grace period to commence commercial operations.”

Additionally, the department noted supply chain constraints impeding the acquisition of large natural gas turbines and transformers that are likely to “further hinder rapid construction and exacerbate reliability concerns.”

J.H. Campbell is also not the first fossil-fired plant ordered to run past its expected retirement date due to resource adequacy concerns. The department also ordered the retention of Constellation’s two-unit Eddystone oil and gas power plant in Pennsylvania.

These mandates to override retirement plans could exceed $3 billion annually, according to a recent analysis by Grid Strategies, conducted on behalf of Earthjustice and other environmental groups.

Based on current trends and outreach to plant owners, DOE may attempt to require nearly all large fossil plants scheduled to retire before the end of 2028 to remain in service, the power sector consultant said. The low estimate here is 34,948 megawatts (MW) of capacity, and the high estimate is 66,337 MW.

Grid Strategies’ analysis uses the cost of recent Reliability Must Run (RMR) contracts as a proxy, estimating an average of $89,315/MW-year, though actual costs from recent DOE orders—such as Campbell’s—suggest this may be a conservative figure.

Under the low estimate, annualized ratepayer costs could exceed $3.1 billion by January 2029 as more plants are forced to stay online past their planned retirement dates.

In the high estimate scenario, applying a conservative 60-year plant age screen, DOE mandates could result in annual ratepayer costs exceeding $5.9 billion by the end of 2028, the analysis suggests.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 02:59:24.033793

But the state highway system can utilize other methods to comply too, including street sweeping, stream restoration and pollution credits.
MDE officials had called the proposed restoration of 11% of impervious acreage “consistent with” Chesapeake Bay restoration goals, but said they heard the feedback and agreed to raise the target to 15%.
Thereby, reducing more pollutants from the stormwater sector toward the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay,” reads the permit document.
A 2022 suit by a number of environmental nonprofits challenging Maryland’s stormwater permit for industrial facilities is still underway.","A new stormwater permit meant to control runoff of polluted rainwater from state roads into state waterways is a “critical missed opportunity,” according to environmental groups, who say the new guidelines backtrack from previous requirements.

The five-year permit, issued Friday to the State Highway Administration by the Maryland Department of the Environment, sets a requirement of controlling runoff on more than 4,000 acres owned by SHA, which is backed up by $216 million in combined state and federal funding, officials said.

“This permit strengthens our ability to protect the Chesapeake Bay and the businesses and communities that rely on it, manage stormwater in overburdened areas, and make our state an even more desirable place to live,” Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain said in a statement Friday.

But advocates, from groups like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said the new permit actually targets less acreage than the last five-year permit did, and it largely leaves it to the SHA to decide what methods it will use to achieve runoff control.

Instead of flexibility, the advocates were hoping the new permit would require more effective runoff control measures, like tree plantings and stormwater ponds that trap water before it reaches natural waterways. But the state highway system can utilize other methods to comply too, including street sweeping, stream restoration and pollution credits.

After last Bay cleanup plan fell short, new proposal aims to be flexible, data-driven

The advocates say those methods aren’t as helpful, in part because they don’t do as much to stop harmful nutrients from running off the streets. Environmental groups and scientists have also cast doubt on the efficacy of some stream restoration projects, which modify stream banks in an effort to curtail erosion.

“We wanted [MDE] to put a cap on … the things that are of lesser value, and a bare minimum on the important things — and they just didn’t do that,” said Evan Isaacson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit Chesapeake Legal Alliance, which represents clients in environmental litigation.

Isaacson added that he remains hopeful that state officials will take the feedback into account, and select the most efficient methods to meet the permit requirements.

SHA spokesperson Shanteé Felix said in a statement that the agency will “utilize a balanced approach of MDE approved strategies that are feasible within the current budget to meet the requirements of the permit.”

Matt Stegman, a staff attorney for the Bay Foundation who focuses on Maryland, said the advocates’ preferred methods also provide more lasting change.

“If you plant a tree, eventually it’s going to be there for decades, as opposed to if you sweep the street, you’ve got to come do it again next week,” Stegman said.

Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement Friday that she doesn’t feel as though the permit takes a strong enough stance to ensure that projects happen in communities near state highways dealing with pollution and flooding concerns.

“Unfortunately, this permit takes a minimalistic approach that fails to prioritize projects addressing climate resilience and water quality in communities most burdened by pollution,” Coble wrote.

But an MDE news release noted the new permit requires SHA to report back about environmental restoration efforts in communities “with environmental justice concerns,” meaning they’re considered historically underserved and overburdened by pollution. The permit also allows for “expanded collaboration” with scientists and other experts to improve data collection, and includes $2.5 million in new funding to perform flood risk studies.

As much as they find shortcomings in the new permit, environmentalists acknowledge it could have been worse: A draft version of the permit released last year was severely criticized.

The previous permit required that SHA take runoff control measures on 20% of its total acreage. The 4,000 acres in the new plan represent 15% of SHA land — but that’s better than the 11% goal in last year’s draft version.

MDE officials had called the proposed restoration of 11% of impervious acreage “consistent with” Chesapeake Bay restoration goals, but said they heard the feedback and agreed to raise the target to 15%.

“As part of these discussions, … SHA indicated a desire to lead by example based on the most recent State budgetary projections: increasing the … commitment to 15% during the next permit term. Thereby, reducing more pollutants from the stormwater sector toward the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay,” reads the permit document.

Isaacson said he’s frustrated that SHA is being asked to restore less acreage than in the prior iteration of its permit. Advocates say that stormwater runoff is one of the more vexing categories of pollution endangering the effort to reduce pollution in the Chesapeake, making improvements all the more important.

Computer modeling data from the Chesapeake Bay Program shows that pollution from “developed” lands, largely stormwater, has increased since bay restoration efforts started in 1985, while other sources, including agriculture and wastewater treatment, have improved their numbers.

These stormwater permits, which are also issued for other sectors and for counties in Maryland, have been the subject of legal challenges in the past. A 2022 suit by a number of environmental nonprofits challenging Maryland’s stormwater permit for industrial facilities is still underway.

It unclear if a legal challenge is in the future for Friday’s permit.

The new permit comes at a challenging time for the multistate effort to improve the bay. After falling short of goals for 2025, the bay states have released a revised agreement, with a range of deadlines five, 10 and 15 years in the future. The Bay Program is accepting comments from the public on that plan through Sept. 1.

Isaacson said Friday’s permit is an example of how lackluster decisions by the participating states can sour the overall effort to meet the cleanup goals.

“They can say all these great things about what they’re committing to in the new bay agreement,” Isaacson said. “When they actually have to do something, they don’t make great decisions.”

A 2023 report from the Bay Program’s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, indicated the need for a more targeted approach to so-called “non-point” pollution — pollution, like stormwater, that doesn’t come directly from a facility’s discharge pipe. The report argued that states should cluster pollution reduction practices in areas with the greatest potential to reduce runoff into the bay.

“That status quo has been random acts of restoration,” Isaacson said. “That’s the status quo that we seek to change.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/6918932-e1755954057672-1024x6831755954619.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=5BzX4ryb,N,,2025-08-23 12:04:24.183892

That’s roughly the same as the daily water demand for a town of up to 50,000 people.

It’s difficult to imagine, because for most users the impact isn’t visible, said AI and Climate Lead Sasha Luccioni with the AI company, Hugging Face.

“In one of my studies, we found that generating a high-definition image uses as much energy as charging half of your phone. And people were like, ‘That can’t be right, because when I use Midjourney (a generative AI program), my phone battery doesn’t go down,’” she said.

Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said tech companies are constantly working to make chips and data centers more efficient, but that does not mean AI’s environmental impact will shrink. That’s because of a problem called the Jevons Paradox.

“The cheaper resources get, the more we tend to use them anyway,” he said. When cars replaced horses, he said, commute times didn’t shrink. We just traveled farther.

Quantifying AI’s footprint

How much those programs contribute to global warming depends on a lot of factors, including how warm it is outside the data center that’s processing the query, how clean the grid is and how complex the AI task is.

Information sources on AI’s contributions to climate change are incomplete and contradictory, so getting exact numbers is difficult.

But Ippolito tried anyway.

He built an app that compares the environmental footprint of different digital tasks based on the limited data he could find. It estimates that a simple AI prompt, such as, “Tell me the capital of France,” uses 23 times more energy than the same question typed into Google without its AI Overview feature.

“Instead of working with existing materials, it’s writing them from scratch. And that takes a lot more compute,” Luccioni said.

And that’s just for a simple prompt. A complex prompt, such as, “Tell me the number of gummy bears that could fit in the Pacific Ocean,” uses 210 times more energy than the AI-free Google search. A 3-second video, according to Ippolito’s app, uses 15,000 times as much energy. It’s equivalent to turning on an incandescent lightbulb and leaving it on for more than a year.

It’s got a big impact, but it doesn’t mean our tech footprints were carbon-free before AI entered the scene.

Watching an hour of Netflix, for example, uses more energy than a complex AI text prompt. An hour on Zoom with 10 people uses 10 times that much.

“It’s not just about making people conscious of AI’s impact, but also all of these digital activities we take for granted,” he said.

Limit tech, limit tech’s climate impact

Ippolito said he limits his use of AI when he can. He suggests using human-captured images instead of AI-generated ones. He tells the AI to stop generating as soon as he has the answer to avoid wasting extra energy. He requests concise answers and he begins Google searches by typing “-ai” so it doesn’t provide an AI overview for queries where he doesn’t need it.

Loewen has adopted the same approach. She said she tries to organize her thoughts into one AI query instead of asking it a series of iterative questions. She also built her own AI that doesn’t rely on large data centers, which saves energy in the same way watching a movie you own on a DVD is far less taxing than streaming one.

“Having something local on your computer in your home allows you to also control your use of the electricity and consumption. It allows you to control your data a little bit more,” she said.

Luccioni uses Ecosia, which is a search engine that uses efficient algorithms and uses profits to plant trees to minimize the impact of each search. Its AI function can also be turned off.

ChatGPT also has a temporary chat function so the queries you send to the data center get deleted after a few weeks instead of taking up data center storage space.

But AI is only taking up a fraction of the data center’s energy use. Ippolito estimates roughly 85% is data collection from sites like TikTok and Instagram, and cryptocurrency.

His answer there: make use of screen time restrictions on your phone to limit time scrolling on social media. Less time means less personal data collected, less energy and water used, and fewer carbon emissions entering the atmosphere.

“If you can do anything that cuts a data center out of the equation, I think that’s a win,” Ippolito said.

Her personal AI use isn’t unique anymore. Now it’s a feature in smartphones, search engines, word processors and email services. Every time someone uses AI, it uses energy that is often generated by fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change.

And it’s getting harder to live without it.

The climate cost

AI is largely powered by data centers that field queries, store data and deploy information. As AI becomes ubiquitous, the power demand for data centers increases, leading to grid reliability problems for people living nearby.

“Since we are trying to build data centers at a pace where we cannot integrate more renewable energy resources into the grid, most of the new data centers are being powered by fossil fuels,” said Noman Bashir, computing and climate impact fellow with MIT’s Climate and Sustainability Consortium.

National studies echo air quality concerns raised by CleanAIRE NC.
Addressing the problem Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.
“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement.
“Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality.","Since the start of the Trump administration, federal officials have been rolling back funding to federal environmental programs and scientific research — moves that threaten to leave vulnerable communities with fewer resources to address air quality concerns.That reality, along with the desire to broaden its reach, prompted the Charlotte-based advocacy group CleanAIRE NC to launch a new interactive online tool designed to educate North Carolinians on environmental issues and provide them with resources for healthier communities.

“Air pollution is an invisible and often understated problem, yet its impact on public health is profound,” said Rafi Vaca, CleanAIRE NC education manager. “We created this platform to demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.”

Mounting research reveals ongoing threats to air quality in urban and rural settings, from vehicle emissions, industrial sources and agriculture. One recent study found that residents living near concentrated animal feeding operations face significantly higher exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5): Levels were 28 percent higher near large cattle operations and 11 percent higher near industrial hog farms compared with communities farther away.

CleanAIRE NC has responded to air quality issues by partnering with communities across the state — from Charlotte’s Historic West End to rural Sampson County — to establish local air-quality monitoring and provide training and educational support for residents most affected by pollution.

A sense of urgency

Particulate matter, or particle pollution, is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets in the air. Some, like dust, pollen or soot, are visible. Those usually fall in the range of PM10, particulate matter that is 10 micrometers, or about one-fifth the diameter of a human hair.

Other particles, such as PM2.5s, are so small they can only be seen with powerful microscopes, according to information provided by the EPA. Exposure to particle pollution can trigger serious health problems, including heart attacks, worsened asthma, reduced lung function and even premature death in people with heart or lung disease.

National studies echo air quality concerns raised by CleanAIRE NC. A 2022 report found higher risks of mortality across all age groups in U.S. regions with elevated PM2.5 levels — areas that often include vulnerable or low-income communities. The authors said the findings highlight the need for more equitable policies to improve air quality.

A 2018 study found that efforts to reduce PM2.5 levels in the U.S. from 1999 to 2013 resulted in a reduced mortality rate among elderly Americans, “worth $24 billion annually by the end of that period.”

Even as the Clean Air Act faces mounting challenges, environmental groups like CleanAIRE NC are working to bridge the gaps created by shifts in federal and state policy. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision redefined “Waters of the United States,” stripping federal protection from some wetlands. More recently, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to re-evaluate the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health. Leaders of CleanAIRE say that together, these developments illustrate the importance of efforts like theirs to inform and empower communities.

Addressing the problem

Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.

“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement. “Growing concerns about our state’s readiness to handle potential environmental emergencies, coupled with recent legal changes, underscore the urgent need for informed community engagement. The CleanAIRE Academy offers a reliable, expert-backed source of information, with content developed by seasoned professionals in air quality, health, policy, advocacy and data science.”

“The CleanAIRE Academy greatly expanded my knowledge of air quality and advocacy,” said Naami Abbey, a student at the University of North CarolinaCharlotte, who described herself as “passionate” about environmental justice and community health.

Abbey was an early user.

“The self-paced courses made learning so much easier, deepening my understanding of air quality and how to turn concern into meaningful action for environmental justice,” she said.

How the academy works

The academy offers two learning modules. “Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality. The second, “Advocacy in Action,” helps participants “learn to navigate policy, craft compelling messages, and engage effectively with decision-makers.”

Four more modules are planned: “Air Pollution and Your Health,” “Environmental Justice,” “AirKeeper Dashboard” and “Community Science and Air Monitoring.”

“CleanAIRE NC has had a history of providing this type of environmental and air pollution education, starting with Atrium Health Network residents,” said Vaca, Clean AIRE’s education manager. “That was to connect environmental factors and pollution to support health outcomes, especially since this is often missing from traditional medical school curricula.”

Vaca said that the shift to online learning will help the organization meet growing demand. “We can’t always take on additional projects like in-person trainings, but the requests we receive from communities facing pollution and other environmental challenges keep growing. So we wanted to scale our work to support them, even if we didn’t have a dedicated grant for their community.”

Vaca expects the academy to expand as it gains traction, to reach beyond their usual partners to transportation agencies or corporations.

“It’s for the public and our impacted communities,” Vaca said. “Now we want to grow it and expand it so it covers a lot more topics.”

Drawing on experience

The idea for the academy originated in house with staff experts in 2024.

“Part of the reason it’s taken so long is because we are getting expert advice and going through a full review process to gather feedback and update these courses so they meet the highest standards,” Vaca said.

The potential audience of academy users includes residents of affected communities, academics, students and policy makers, Vaca said.

In terms of what Vaca hopes academy course enrollees gain from the experience, she said: “I hope our participants or students see that these topics don’t have to be boring or intimidating.

“The takeaway should be that hope and resilience come when we lean on our communities, when we educate ourselves and support the work that is already being done for a cleaner environment.”

The UK’s newly unveiled 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy marks a pivotal moment for the country’s commitment to clean growth and sustainable development. Central to this bold vision is a record-breaking commitment to invest at least £725billion into economic and social infrastructure from 2025 to 2035, with an explicit focus on energy transition, the decarbonisation of industry, and regional economic opportunities.

The government’s ambition is to future-proof the nation, positioning the UK as a “clean energy superpower” while boosting jobs, local economies, and energy security.

This comprehensive strategy isn’t just about spending. It’s about making the UK the home of green technology, from sweeping investments in offshore and onshore wind to state-backed solar expansion and pioneering hydrogen projects. The formation of the new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (NISTA) ensures these ambitions move from planning to action, delivering infrastructure that supports clean growth targets, creates jobs, and enables innovations such as solar PV and battery storage—installations expertly handled by Atlantic Renewables.

Offshore Wind and Solar Are Driving the UK’s Renewable Revolution

The 10-Year Plan for infrastructure prioritises ambitious capacity targets for renewable energy. By 2030, the government is aiming for:

43-50GW of offshore wind

27-29GW of onshore wind

45-47GW of solar generation

These commitments come with public and private investment incentives designed to harness the UK’s natural assets and existing expertise. For solar specifically, this will mean a dramatic rise in rooftop and ground-mount solar installations, supporting the government’s targets for 95% of electricity to be low-carbon by the end of the decade.

If you want to participate in the UK’s clean energy transition with your own solar PV system, contact our team of expert engineers at Atlantic Renewables today for a custom solution!

What Are the Key Milestones for UK Clean Growth?

A defining feature of the new strategy is the suite of milestones set to drive the UK towards its clean growth ambitions. Some of the most significant include:

Launch of Great British Energy: With up to £8.3billion earmarked for renewable and nuclear projects over the upcoming Spending Review period, this state-backed body will invest directly in new energy infrastructure

Hydrogen Network Pioneering: Over £500million allocated to launch the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, helping to decarbonise hard-to-electrify sectors

Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS): £9.4billion for major CCUS clusters to capture industrial emissions at scale

Grid Upgrades: Ofgem has dedicated £8.9billion to the most significant National Grid expansion since the 1960s, improving renewable integration and grid resilience

By 2030, estimates suggest clean energy investment could reach over £30billion per year, facilitating the connection of up to 126GW of clean power to the grid.

How Will the Private Sector and Atlantic Renewables Support UK Goals?

Government funding alone cannot deliver the UK’s clean growth vision. The plan explicitly acknowledges that the vast majority of capital will come from private investment, with targets calling for £200billion by 2030 and up to £700billion by 2035 for energy infrastructure. This monumental mobilisation relies on clarity, regulatory certainty, and robust public-private partnerships.

For business , housing developers, and public sector bodies looking to benefit, working with trusted, experienced renewable energy partners such as Atlantic Renewables will be critical to unlocking these opportunities. Our team stands ready to guide clients from feasibility to installation and long-term maintenance, ensuring you meet the latest technical and regulatory standards.

Jobs Investment and the Economic Impact of Clean Growth

The UK’s green economy is no longer on the horizon—it is here and accelerating. In recent years, over 68,000 green jobs have already been created through targeted government initiatives, and private investment in clean growth has topped £22billion. By 2030, low-carbon industries are forecast to support more than 460,000 jobs, across manufacturing, engineering, installation, and R&D—making clean growth a pillar of national economic resilience.

The economic opportunity is vast, with estimates suggesting that UK low-carbon goods and services could generate between £60billion and £170billion in export sales by 2030. Atlantic Renewables continues to play a key role in this transformation, delivering scalable solar PV and battery storage solutions for homes and commercial clients around the UK.

What Does the 10-Year Strategy Mean for Solar Installations and Battery Storage?

For property owners and businesses, the Infrastructure Strategy offers both stability and opportunity. With meaningful policy support, enhanced grid connectivity, and clear targets for solar deployment, the next decade is set to be the most dynamic on record for UK-based solar PV and battery projects.

European scientists have confirmed progress on a project that uses sensors and repair systems to keep batteries working for far longer than today’s models.

Current packs typically last around eight to fifteen years, but researchers say this technology could double that timespan.

If it works as planned, it may change how drivers think about electric vehicle ownership.

The race to build a tougher EV battery

Battery lifespan has been a central concern for electric vehicle buyers, with many questioning how long a pack can hold up before costly replacement.

The EU-funded PHOENIX project is testing a self-healing battery that monitors changes inside its cells and triggers repair when needed.

The aim is to extend usable life, improve reliability, and reduce the number of packs that end up as waste.

The EV battery system uses sensors to collect information on heat, voltage, swelling, and gas buildup, which can be early signs of damage.

When a problem is detected, the system can respond by applying controlled heat, reshaping the cell, or disrupting small metallic structures that form during charging.

These measures are designed to prevent failures that shorten performance or risk safety.

Johannes Ziegler, a materials scientist at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, told Horizon magazine that the goal is to increase lifetime while cutting resource demand.

Fewer replacements mean fewer materials mined and processed, which lowers both environmental impact and cost.

Adding more sensors and repair functions increases production expenses, but researchers are studying which ones provide the most benefit.

The long-term target is a smaller, lighter EV battery that performs more consistently over time.

What it means for electric vehicles

A self-healing EV battery could lower ownership costs by lasting well beyond 20 years, keeping the same pack in use for the lifetime of a car.

That longevity also means fewer batteries reaching recycling facilities, easing pressure on systems that process used packs.

Improved safety is another benefit. By preventing internal faults from escalating, the system reduces the risk of serious failure.

While studies show an electric vehicle is less likely to catch fire than a gasoline car, reinforcing consumer trust remains important for growth.

Work on self-healing battery technology is also underway outside Europe.

Teams in the United States and Asia are exploring new designs that stretch or repair themselves during use.

Inspection tools developed by other companies aim to spot flaws before packs ever leave the factory.

Together, these efforts show how the industry is moving toward batteries that are both more durable and more sustainable.

Analysts expect that combining longer battery lifespan with improved recycling and falling production costs will accelerate the shift to electric vehicles.

The changes to the IRA clean energy tax credits also have significant impacts on governments and other tax-exempt entities.
It is important to note that the OBBBA did not make changes to the availability of the direct pay election for the IRA clean energy credits.
Section 45W – Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit Tax-exempt organizations can qualify for this credit when they purchase a qualifying vehicle under §45W.
§45Y & 48E— Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits The OBBBA also made changes to the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) under §45Y and to the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under §48E.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, made sweeping changes to many of the clean energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). A detailed overview of those changes and their impacts to taxpayers can be found in our FORsights™ article, Impact of OBBBA on IRA Clean Energy Credits.

The changes to the IRA clean energy tax credits also have significant impacts on governments and other tax-exempt entities. Although tax credits are traditionally beneficial to taxable entities, the direct pay election allows these credits to be an option for qualifying entities in the public sector. It is important to note that the OBBBA did not make changes to the availability of the direct pay election for the IRA clean energy credits. Further, tax-exempt entities must complete Form 990-T to claim the credits one registration is complete. For more on direct pay, the registration process, and other guidance, see our FORsight here.

The following credits and deductions have been potential opportunities to the public sector—either via direct pay or another mechanism. Therefore, it’s important to understand how these incentives are changing based on adjustments from the OBBBA.

Credits & Deductions Repealed

Several incentives applicable to governmental and tax-exempt entities were repealed in the OBBBA.

Section 45W – Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit

Tax-exempt organizations can qualify for this credit when they purchase a qualifying vehicle under §45W. However, the OBBBA repealed this credit for vehicles purchased after September 30, 2025. For those placing in service vehicles before this date, the vehicles must still meet the applicable requirements, e.g., be made by a qualified manufacturer and meet battery capacity requirements. For more on the calculation and requirements of this credit, see our FORsight here.

§30C – Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit

Tax-exempt and government entities may qualify for this credit when they purchase and install qualified refueling and recharging equipment. The OBBBA repealed this credit for property placed in service after June 30, 2026. Often referred to as the “charging station” credit, there are various requirements for what property qualifies. For example, the refueling property must be located in an eligible census tract (in a low-income community or that is not in an urban area). For more on the requirements of this property, see our FORsight here.

§179D – Energy Efficient Commercial Building Deduction

Tax-exempt and government entities can leverage this deduction by allocating it to the designers of Energy Efficient Commercial Building Property (EECBP) or Energy Efficient Commercial Building Retrofit Property (EEBRP). The OBBBA repealed this deduction for projects that begin construction after June 30, 2026.

As a reminder, to claim the deduction, EECBP and EEBRP must be part of:

Interior lighting systems

HVAC systems

Hot water systems

Building envelope

For more on the §179D deduction and OBBBA’s impact on this opportunity, see our FORsight here.

§45Y & 48E— Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits

The OBBBA also made changes to the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) under §45Y and to the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under §48E.

While the credits remain available for many types of property, one of the biggest changes from the OBBBA applies to wind and solar facilities. To claim the credit for wind and solar facilities:

If construction begins by July 4, 2026, the facilities must be placed in service at the latest December 31, 2030.

If construction begins after July 4, 2026, the facilities must be placed in service by December 31, 2027.

Other eligible projects like geothermal, biogas, and battery storage can obtain the credit by beginning construction prior to December 31, 2033. Projects beginning after that date are eligible for reduced credits, and are phased out completely by 2036.

Regardless of property type, the OBBBA incorporated restrictions on the involvement of certain prohibited foreign entities—whether it be due to ownership, payments, or material assistance. Property that previously qualified may no longer, depending on where its components are sourced. These rules are complex—reach out to your experienced Forvis Mazars professional for more on this topic.

President Trump issued an executive order titled “ ,” which directs the Secretary of the Treasury to strictly enforce the termination of 45Y and 48E for wind and solar credits. The executive order also directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue revised guidance to prevent the “beginning of construction” (BOC) from being manipulated to take advantage of the tax credit. Notice 2025-42 was issued on August 15, 2025, in response to this executive order. Previously, there were two accepted methods for establishing a BOC date. Generally speaking, this notice negates the ability to use the “5% safe harbor” for BOC, potentially making it more difficult for some entities to meet the previously mentioned OBBBA timing requirements for solar and wind facilities.

How Forvis Mazars Can Help

While some credits and deductions are ending or phasing out over the next several years, there is still time for tax exempt and government entities to take advantage of them. It is important to carefully consider the eligibility requirements and relevant deadlines for these credits and deductions when planning to make capital investments in clean energy. For the government or tax-exempt entity interested in taking advantage of clean energy credits and deductions, there are several questions to answer:

Consider organizational goals and current progress. Will you be able to meet the eligibility timelines?

Do you have projects that could be placed on an accelerated timeline to take advantage of the currently available credits?

Are you considering the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for the ITC and PTC?

Do you have a trusted consultant to help you navigate the nuanced compliance requirements and tax implications?

After consulting with the Department of Energy, the agency said it is granting full exemptions on 63 of the petitions, partial exemptions to 77 petitions, and denying 28 of the petitions.
The approved exemptions amounted to about 5.34 billion RINs, also known as Renewable Identification Numbers, the tradable compliance credits generated by blending biofuels into the fuel supply.
The renewable volume obligations set demand for the Renewable Identification Numbers market, and small refinery exemptions decrease demand.
Somewhat less thrilled was Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, which represents oil refiners.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday approved a backlog of requests from small oil refineries seeking exemptions from a federal mandate to blend biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply.

In an announcement on its website, the EPA said it evaluated a total of 175 exemption requests from 28 small refineries, some going back as far as 2016.

After consulting with the Department of Energy, the agency said it is granting full exemptions on 63 of the petitions, partial exemptions to 77 petitions, and denying 28 of the petitions.

In addition, it said, it has decided seven of the petitions are ineligible for consideration.

The approved exemptions amounted to about 5.34 billion RINs, also known as Renewable Identification Numbers, the tradable compliance credits generated by blending biofuels into the fuel supply.

Friday’s action, however, is a mixed blessing. Because RINs have just a two-year lifespan, only 1.39 billion can still be used for compliance and retain any value, according to the EPA announcement.

Still, Patrick Serfass, executive director of the American Biogas Council, found plenty to be happy about in the agency’s decision.

“Issuing small refinery exemptions now, before [the next] renewable volume obligations are finalized, allows the EPA to balance both levers in the Renewable Fuel Standard to make sure they work together harmoniously and promote the healthy function of the RINs market,” Serfass said in a written statement.

The renewable volume obligations set demand for the Renewable Identification Numbers market, and small refinery exemptions decrease demand.

“Announcing the SREs now gives the EPA the opportunity to follow the recommendation from the American Biogas Council and other renewable fuel producers to increase RVOs, which would increase demand and balance out the impact of issuing SREs,” Serfass said.

“Without an increase in RVOs, RIN credit prices could crash, creating a harmful economic ripple effect across rural America. The EPA can make this all work together to protect farmers and rural communities, who depend on a strong, stable RFS program,” he added.

Somewhat less thrilled was Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, which represents oil refiners.

“We are glad EPA finally fulfilled its statutory obligation to act on SRE petitions. Yet, it is inexplicable that EPA is even considering adding more mandated biofuels on top of the largest and most expensive RFS mandate ever proposed by reallocating exempted volumes,” Thompson said.

“The 2026 and 2027 RFS would already cost refiners and consumers up to $70 billion each year and cannot be met with domestic feedstocks alone,” he continued. “Piling on more than a billion gallons in additional, reallocated mandates will do nothing other than increase imports, harm U.S. energy dominance and cost consumers.

“This is akin to your neighbor getting a tax break and the IRS showing up at your doorstep with the bill. It is simply wrong,” Thompson added.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/biogas.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 12:03:50.446930

Representatives for Dominion did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the probe announced Thursday.","Dive Brief:

The U.S. Department of Commerce has opened a probe into “the effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines and their parts and components,” the agency said in a notice Thursday.

The investigation began Aug. 13 under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to restrict imports on national security grounds. The department will accept public comment on the case for 15 days after it appears in the Federal Register, which is scheduled for Monday.

Capstone analysts said in a note that they expect the Commerce Department to expedite the investigation and apply tariffs “likely around 25%-50%, consistent with other Section 232 duties imposed by this administration.”

Dive Insight:

The analysts said they expect tariffs to materially raise the cost of construction, estimating that a 10% increase in the input costs of an onshore wind project would raise its levelized cost of energy by 4%.

The U.S. imported wind components worth $2.83 billion last year, with Germany as the single largest source of imports, followed by Mexico, France and India, according to Capstone. The analysis noted that many wind components have also been hit by steel and aluminum tariffs.

The probe represents the latest escalation in President Donald Trump’s campaign against wind-powered electricity generation. In addition to successfully repealing most clean energy tax credits in the Republican domestic policy bill earlier this summer, the administration has also revoked permits for wind farms and rescinded designated offshore “wind energy areas” on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.

Just this week, Trump wrote in a post on social media that his administration “will not approve” wind or solar projects.

Utilities and developers with wind projects were facing rising costs even before the probe was announced.

Dominion Energy’s CEO said he expected the cost of the utility’s 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project to rise by about $506 million due to tariffs during an earnings call earlier this month. Despite the heftier price tag, the project was still on schedule for completion by the end of 2026. Once completed, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind would be the largest capacity wind-powered generator in the country.

Representatives for Dominion did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the probe announced Thursday.

The Commerce Department said in the notice it is particularly interested in comments related to the concentration of U.S. imports of wind turbines “from a small number of suppliers or foreign nations and the associated risks,” the impact of “foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices,” and “the potential for foreign control or exploitation of the wind turbine supply chain.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/qmHL1nTP6CyrN9PkFVRStdEg-z3bdBn0B_VxzwqV8Is/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CbG9ja19Jc2xhbmRfd2luZF90dXJiaW5lc193YXZlcy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-08-23 02:59:28.600702

Last year, Piedmont Lithium cut nearly half of its workforce in two layoffs amid the lithium market slump.","The $623 million merger of Piedmont Lithium in Belmont and Australia-based Sayona Mining received preliminary approval from shareholders Friday following two delays.

Piedmont Lithium has plans to open a $1 billion mine in Gaston County, west of Charlotte. Both companies jointly own a North America Lithium project in Quebec, Canada.

The new company will be headquartered in Australia, with its U.S. headquarters in Belmont. Following the nearly 50-50 equity holding split, the new company will be called Elevra Lithium.

The merger is not expected to upend the plans in Gaston County.

Lithium is used in batteries to power electric vehicles, bikes and personal electronic devices. But the price of lithium has continued to fall with slowing EV sales, causing companies to consolidate and delay projects.

About 30 seconds after opening the vote, at 11:11 a.m. on Friday, Piedmont Lithium’s Bruce Czachor, executive vice president and chief legal officer, read the results during a virtual shareholders meeting. Shareholders also could vote before Friday’s meeting.

“The preliminary results show that we have received votes and proxies sufficient to approve all proposals voted on today,” Czachor said.

The three proxies voted on were:

The proposal to adopt the agreement and plan of the merger announced Nov. 18, 2024.

An advisory vote on compensation that may be paid to Piedmont’s executive officers related to the merger.

A possible postponement of the special meeting to a later date to gather additional proxies if merger agreement votes are insufficient.

The official minutes of the meeting with the final vote tabulations will be filed with the SEC.

Shareholders were able to vote up until the polls were closed during the meeting, so there are additional votes that need to be confirmed and added to the results in order for them to be official, Malissa Gordon, vice president of government affairs for Piedmont Lithium told The Charlotte Observer on Friday.

“The remaining steps are largely customary in closing any merger,” Gordon said.

The vote had been adjourned twice due to lack of quorums, on July 31 and Aug. 11.

“This is a significant moment in the history of Piedmont Lithium,” Piedmont Lithium CEO Keith Phillips said Friday following the vote.

Piedmont Lithium was formed eight years ago, and now includes lithium mines in Canada and Ghana.

Four years ago, Piedmont announced it was planning a $1.2 billion lithium mine on over 1,500 acres east of Cherryville, about 25 miles west of Charlotte. Only 2% of the world’s lithium is available in the U.S., and North Carolina is among only a few places in the world where lithium mining is possible.

Piedmont’s joint acquisition with Sayona of its Quebec, Canada, lithium mine began operating in 2023. It is the largest lithium operation in North America, Phillips said Friday.

“It became increasingly clear to both Piedmont and Sayona that our future would be brighter as one larger, simpler, stronger company,” Phillips said. “Together, we will have a broader portfolio, increased scale and a lower cost structure.”

On Thursday, the updated closing timetable for the merger by Piedmont Lithium, following approval, shows the effective time of the merger is 4 p.m. Aug. 29, which is also the last day Piedmont shares will be traded. Sayona shareholders approved the merger in July.

About the new lithium mining company

The combined lithium business from the merger of Piedmont Lithium and Sayona Mining also is subject to regulatory approvals.

Sayona’s Lucas Dow will become CEO of the merged company, with Phillips acting as a strategic advisor during the transition.

The board for Elevra will be made up of four nominees from each company. The chair designated for Elevra Lithium is Dawne Hickton of Piedmont.

The estimated market capitalization of the new company is $623 million. Piedmont had 23 workers as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s 10-K filing. Reports show that Sayona has about 230 employees.

More about Piedmont Lithium

Piedmont Lithium reported $11.9 million in revenue at its second quarter earnings ending June 30.

Last year, Piedmont Lithium cut nearly half of its workforce in two layoffs amid the lithium market slump. In November, the company began looking for a funding partner for its Gaston County mining project.

The company also abandoned its Tennessee Lithium conversion plans in favor of its Carolina project.

The North Carolina project will add a second lithium hydroxide production train as part of a phased development, depending on market conditions, Piedmont Lithium said in Thursday’s merger timeline release.

“We are progressing our development of Carolina Lithium on a conservative timeline, monitoring dynamic market conditions and focusing on strategic partnerships and our funding strategy,” Phillips said during the earnings call.

Phillips said that although lithium prices remain depressed, the world continues to move toward electrification.

Piedmont Lithium is in the process of regulatory approvals for its North Carolina mine, about 25 miles west of Charlotte. Its air permit application is under review by North Carolina’s Division of Air Quality, the company reported during the earnings call Aug. 7.

Lithium mining in NC

The project is one of two lithium mines planned in North Carolina along the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt.

Large green areas in white pegmatite rock called spodumene are extracted to make lithium. North Carolina is among a few places in the world where lithium mining is possible. Piedmont has a contract with Tesla for its lithium.

The other project is from Charlotte-based Albemarle Corp., which is reopening a dormant lithium mine in Kings Mountain. Albemarle’s project is on nearly 1,200-acres in Cleveland County, about 30 miles west of Charlotte off Interstate 85.

Albemarle is the world’s largest lithium miner.

Irving-based Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Dallas-based Hunt Energy have signed a long-term strategic agreement focused on delivering efficient, independent energy production to meet the demands of hyperscale and distributed data operations, Caterpillar announced this week.

Their first project—expected to launch in Texas—will kick off a multi-year plan to deploy up to 1 gigawatt of generation capacity across North America. The companies say the initiative lays the groundwork for future global expansion.

Melissa Busen, senior vice president of Caterpillar’s Electric Power division, said Hunt’s infrastructure experience complements Caterpillar’s power systems portfolio.

In a statement, she said the two companies plan to “jointly develop scalable solutions that meet the high demands of reliability, uptime, and performance critical to data center operations.”

Caterpillar, which reported $64.8 billion in 2024 sales and revenue, said it will supply a full range of power technologies, including natural gas and diesel generators, gas turbines, switchgear, controls, aftertreatment systems, and engineering services. The company also pointed to its advanced monitoring and servicing capabilities, designed to ensure uninterrupted power whether connected to the grid or running independently.

Hunt will lead development, financing, and execution for the projects. The company also brings experience in battery energy storage systems (BESS), having deployed more than 310 megawatts of BESS solutions over the past four years.

Founded in 1934, Hunt is a private, family-owned company with more than 90 years in global energy and real estate development. It operates across four continents and has developed a wide range of infrastructure, from upstream oil and gas to LNG terminals and high-voltage transmission systems.

That track record, Hunt says, positions the company to take on what’s next.

“Starting in Texas, we’re laying the foundation for a new era of data center power infrastructure,” Hunt Energy CEO Hunter Hunt said in a statement.

For example, for solar facilities, “physical work of a significant nature” may include the installation of racks or other structures to affix photovoltaic panels, collectors, or solar cells to a site.

In many ways, the Notice is good news for the wind and solar industry. Each had been concerned that the Treasury would issue rules that would not allow for a project to begin construction for tax purposes until a “significant portion of the facility is built.”

Although the Executive Order pursuant to which the Notice was issued directs Treasury to issue guidance on the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements, the Notice specifically states (in a footnote) that the Notice does not address the FEOC restrictions, including when construction begins for the “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” rules found in Section 45Y(b)(6) and 48E(b)(1)(E) of the Code, as amended by the OBBBA (the FEOC Equipment Rule), which only apply to projects beginning construction Jan. 1, 2026, or later.

Taxpayers also must maintain a continuous program of construction with respect to the facility. A continuous program of construction involves continuing physical work of a significant nature. Section 4.04 of the Notice provides a safe harbor that taxpayers may rely on to satisfy this requirement; outside the safe harbor, establishing continuity will be determined by the relevant facts and circumstances.

As McGuireWoods notes, “although the Notice does not contain specific language regarding work on a main power transformer (69 KV or greater), the applicable Treasury Regulations include in a qualified facility “transformers, inverters and converters which modify the characteristics of electricity into a form suitable for use, transmission or distribution.” Therefore, a popular safe harbor method whereby a taxpayer begins physical work of a significant nature on a main power transformer should continue to be available.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15927_0026.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 06:59:33.499196

Pacifico Energy expects to eventually build out 5 GW of off-grid and gas-fired energy capacity, starting with 1 GW by 2028, to meet developing demand.
“GW Ranch isn’t just about scale—it’s about certainty,” said Constantyn Gieskes, vice president at Pacifico Energy.
“Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development.
Pacifico is designing GW Ranch to include 5 GW of dedicated off-grid and gas-fired power generation, as well as 1.8 GW of energy storage.","Global renewables developer Pacifico Energy is wagering that the “ranch” in the fossil-rich Lone Star State will come to the rescue for a data center industry that will need and expect gigawatts of new and clean power in coming years.

That’s the GW Ranch, a newly announced endeavor which is Pacifico’s planned off-grid power generation project under development in Pecos County, Texas. The 8,000+ acre site, presumably named for “gigawatt,” is being designed to pair natural gas-fired turbine generation with vast amounts of battery storage capacity.

All of that will be focused on directly meeting hyperscale data center and artificial intelligence (AI) load that would locate in the general area. Pacifico Energy expects to eventually build out 5 GW of off-grid and gas-fired energy capacity, starting with 1 GW by 2028, to meet developing demand.

“GW Ranch isn’t just about scale—it’s about certainty,” said Constantyn Gieskes, vice president at Pacifico Energy. “Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development. By building off-grid and working hand-in-hand with local officials, we’re delivering the speed, reliability, and responsible development that our customers and communities both demand.”

Hype abounds in the energy transition industry and so-called ""Industrial Compute Age."" All kinds of ideas are going forward, only some of which will succeed, but the off-grid concept is gaining momentum due to the long interconnection queues in trying to integrate distributed energy resources with the utility grids.

Los Angeles-based Pacifico Energy plans to build GW Ranch completely unconnected to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid system, thus avoiding many permitting delays. The company is working with Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), Pecos County and local officials on the permitting it does require. TCEQ is leading the state permitting process.

“Pecos County’s continued effort to diversify the local economy directly aligns with the development of GW Ranch,” Remie Ramos, Pecos County Economic Development Director, said. “The minimal impact of an off-grid data center will increase the county tax base, create new jobs, and have an overall positive impact on our county while conserving water and placing no constraints on local infrastructure.”

Pecos County is situated in west Texas above the oil and gas-rich Permian Basin which supplies a large percentage of U.S. production. Pacifico is designing GW Ranch to include 5 GW of dedicated off-grid and gas-fired power generation, as well as 1.8 GW of energy storage.

The ERCOT grid nearly shut down in early 2021 after an extended winter storm coupled with 52 GW of electricity capacity knocked off-line. Those outages included gas-fired, renewable, nuclear, wind and gas wellheads within drilling sites.

Various forecasts predict that the race to achieve AI dominance for the U.S. will drive some 125 GW of new data center capacity online by sometime in the early 2030s. Many of those operational data centers are in northern Virginia and California, but Texas is growing as an attractive site for tech companies due to favorable regulatory and legislative moves in recent years.

Developer Crusoe, which is supported with private equity funding from an offshoot of Google parent company Alphabet, started construction on a data center in Abilene, Texas, which is focused on serving OpenAI and Oracle.

Pacifico Energy has worked on power projects across the world, including Vietnam, Korea and Japan. Many of those projects in the U.S. and abroad have distributed energy and microgrids, but the company is shifting into prime power projects which directly meet main load for facilities.

Pacifico is financially backed by a variety of large-scale investors, including Sumitomo, Goldman Sachs, GE Energy Financial Services, Shinsei Bank and Dragon Capital, among others.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/08/68a87d6ac9c895e2edec79aa-natural_gas_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-23 05:00:28.699615

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration plans to make available about 20 metric tons of Cold War-era plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads to U.S. power companies as a potential fuel for reactors, according to a source familiar with the matter and a draft memo outlining the plan.

Plutonium has previously only been converted to fuel for commercial U.S. reactors in short-lived tests. The plan would follow through on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in May ordering the government to halt much of its existing program to dilute and dispose of surplus plutonium, and instead provide it as a fuel for advanced nuclear technologies.

The Department of Energy, or DOE, plans to announce in coming days it will seek proposals from industry, said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The source cautioned that because the plan is still a draft, its final details could change pending further discussions.

The plutonium would be offered to industry at little to no cost — with a catch. Industry will be responsible for costs of transportation, designing, building, and decommissioning DOE-authorized facilities to recycle, process and manufacture the fuel, the memo said.

The details on the volume of the plutonium, industry’s responsibilities in the plan and the potential timing of a U.S. announcement, have not been previously reported. The 20 metric tons would be drawn from a larger, 34-metric-ton stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium that the United States had previously committed to dispose of under a non-proliferation agreement with Russia in 2000.

The Department of Energy did not confirm or deny the Reuters reporting, saying only that the department is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium,” as directed by Trump’s orders.

Boosting the U.S. power industry is a policy priority for the Trump administration as U.S. electricity demand rises for the first time in two decades on the boom in data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

The idea of using surplus plutonium for fuel has raised concerns among nuclear safety experts who argue a previous similar effort failed.

Under the 2000 agreement, the plutonium was initially planned to be converted to mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, to run in nuclear power plants. But in 2018, the first Trump administration killed the contract for a MOX project that it said would have cost more than $50 billion.

The U.S. Energy Department holds surplus plutonium at heavily guarded weapons facilities including Savannah River in South Carolina, Pantex in Texas, and Los Alamos in New Mexico. Plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years and must be handled with protective gear.

Until Trump’s May order, the U.S. program to dispose of the plutonium has involved blending it with an inert material and storing it in an experimental underground storage site called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.

The Energy Department has estimated that burying the plutonium would cost $20 billion.

“Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity. It would entail trying to repeat the disastrous MOX fuel program and hoping for a different result,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The excess plutonium is a dangerous waste product and DOE should stick to the safer, more secure and far cheaper plan to dilute and directly dispose of it in WIPP.”

WEST DES MOINES, IA – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a long-awaiting decision on 175 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) refinery exemption (SRE) requests dating from 2016 to 2024. In total, the EPA granted 63 full exemptions and 77 partial exemptions totaling 5.34 billion gallons. EPA denied 28 claims and found another 7 ineligible.

“We must get RFS refinery waiver uncertainty out of the market and today’s action by EPA takes a big step forward,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw. “While we can quibble with the justification of the SREs granted, the EPA was spot-on in reissuing the same retired RFS credits back to the refiners who received an exemption. This is consistent with past actions when the shoe was on the other foot and is in line with the overall goals of the RFS. One absolutely vital question remains: how or if the SREs from 2023 to 2025 will be reallocated. That is a two-billion-gallon uncertainty hanging over the market and the pending RFS blending rule for 2026 and 2027.”

Also today, EPA announced that in the near future it will release a proposed rule to outline how the exempted RFS volumes of the 2023 and later compliance years, expected to be over two billion gallons, could be reallocated. EPA has previously stated that it will account for projected SREs for 2026 and 2027 when finalizing the RFS blending levels for those years. EPA stated: “The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.”

“Full and complete reallocation of the 2023 and newer SREs is the vital point,” stated Shaw. “In the end, that will determine whether the EPA upholds President Trump’s commitment to the RFS and to American farmers. If true reallocation does not occur, then EPA is effectively reducing the already low RFS blending levels for 2025. IRFA was heartened by EPA’s announcement today that it will propose reallocating the exempted volumes. We now anxiously await EPA’s reallocation proposal, at which time we will be commenting in the strongest possible terms that reallocation of every SRE gallon must occur, and we will implore the EPA to end the SRE uncertainty before finalizing the 2026-2027 RFS rule.”

When granted, SREs allow a refinery out of their blending obligation under the landmark RFS program, which is the bedrock renewable fuels policy in the U.S. The EPA sets an RFS blending level for each year. As a result, any SRE effectively reduces the RFS blending level. To avoid this, the RFS law called on EPA to estimate the amount of SREs likely to be granted and to factor this into the RFS blending level formula each year, a process commonly referred to as “reallocation” because it essentially upholds the RFS blending level while shifting any exempted obligation from those parties to the obligated parties that did not receive exemptions.

“IRFA has loudly applauded the Trump administration and the EPA for the proposing record-high RFS blend levels for 2026 and 2027,” stated Shaw. “We would hate to see these volumes rendered meaningless due to billions of gallons of un-reallocated SREs. So while we greatly appreciate that the Trump Administration has signaled they will reallocate 2023 and newer refinery waivers, we must examine those details. At the end of the day, the penalty for the failure of the previous RFS rules under the prior administration to include SRE forecasts should not be paid solely by renewable fuels producers. The integrity of the RFS depends on it.”

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association represents the state’s liquid renewable fuels industry and works to foster its growth. Iowa is the nation’s leader in renewable fuels production with 42 ethanol refineries capable of producing 4.7 billion gallons annually – including 34 million gallons of annual cellulosic ethanol production capacity – and 10 biodiesel facilities with the capacity to produce 416 million gallons annually.

Mobilize has partnered with Andersen to offer colorful wall chargers to customers purchasing EVs from three automotive brands.

Those who purchase cars ranging from city runabouts to spacious family vehicles can now get a seven-kilowatt charger professionally installed at the promotional price.

The deal applies to buyers of six specific models, including the compact, city-friendly Dacia Spring, the retro-styled Renault 5, the practical Renault 4, the family-oriented Renault Scenic, the sleek Renault Megane, and the sporty Alpine A290. Each vehicle can be paired with a home charger that matches the owner's style.

Buyers can pick from 200 different colors for their wall unit, which also works with rooftop solar panels. This allows drivers to fuel their cars using solar energy from their own homes. For those interested in solar power, compare quotes from local installers with EnergySage.

The wall units simplify life for EV owners by allowing them to plug in overnight at home, eliminating the need to hunt for public charging stations. These chargers communicate with power companies to juice up cars when electricity costs drop to around 6.7 pence per kilowatt-hour, putting hundreds of pounds back in drivers' pockets each year.

Smart charging compatibility means the units can work with popular energy plans that offer the lowest rates during off-peak hours.

Making home charging cheaper and easier means fewer gas-powered cars on roads, which cuts down on harmful exhaust fumes. Reduced pollution leads to healthier breathing for everyone, particularly children and seniors, whose lungs are most susceptible to dirty air.

Business leaders celebrated what this deal could mean for drivers. Rosa Aguirre of Mobilize said the arrangement gives customers top-tier charging that complements their vehicles' modern features.

Established by Democrats' 2021 infrastructure bill, the Clean School Bus Program emerged as one of the Biden administration's signature climate initiatives.
Climate activists have advocated for school districts to transition from their diesel-powered bus fleets to electric ones to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Electric buses, however, are prohibitively expensive for most school districts.
Several school districts across the country have completely removed their Lion buses from service over mechanical and safety concerns.","The Biden administration awarded Canadian electric bus maker Lion Electric $159 million to manufacture 435 school buses between 2022 and 2024, making it the third-largest recipient of such funding. The company has since fallen into bankruptcy, failed to deliver hundreds of the buses it promised, and warned school districts that its dire financial straits prevent it from servicing those in circulation.

As a result, many of those districts are turning back to diesel.

The Washington Free Beacon reported earlier this year that Lion, then nearing bankruptcy, had yet to deliver $95 million worth of the electric buses it pledged to produce as part of the Biden administration's $5 billion Clean School Bus program. Since then, Lion was sold for just $6 million during bankruptcy proceedings after being valued at $4.7 billion as recently as June 2021. The company also permanently shuttered multiple manufacturing plants, fired the majority of its employees, and told consumers that it could no longer honor warranties and purchase orders in the United States.

Lion's dramatic fall from grace marks one of the most apparent failures stemming from Democrats' green energy agenda, particularly as school districts turn back to the diesel-powered vehicles the Clean School Bus program was designed to phase out.

""All of our contacts from Lion that we worked so closely with to ensure the project's success have been fired,"" Mike Leskowich, superintendent of the Homer Community School District in southern Michigan, told the Free Beacon. ""We are going to keep our electric fleet on the roads for as long as possible. Eventually, however, we will return to diesel, as the cost of the vehicle is far less than electric.""

Leskowich, whose district received $2.8 million in federal funding to procure seven Lion buses in 2022, added that Homer schools have started sourcing their own parts to repair their buses. He told the Free Beacon that it ""does hurt"" that the buses' warranties are no longer valid.

Charlie Butler, superintendent of the Madison Parish School District in northern Louisiana, said the 14 Lion buses his district received are still new, but that he is struggling to find companies that can repair them.

""Some of the issues do require funding, which we are managing at this time,"" Butler told the Free Beacon.

Established by Democrats' 2021 infrastructure bill, the Clean School Bus Program emerged as one of the Biden administration's signature climate initiatives.

""Who doesn't love a yellow school bus, right?"" then-vice president Kamala Harris asked when promoting the program in 2022. ""It's part of a nostalgia, a memory of the excitement and joy of going to school to be with your favorite teacher, to be with your best friends, and to learn. The school bus takes us there.""

Climate activists have advocated for school districts to transition from their diesel-powered bus fleets to electric ones to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Electric buses, however, are prohibitively expensive for most school districts. They cost more than $350,000 on average, whereas new diesel-powered buses typically cost around $100,000, according to environmental think tank Resources for the Future. They also require districts to invest in high-powered charging infrastructure and new training for drivers.

Several school districts across the country have completely removed their Lion buses from service over mechanical and safety concerns. A superintendent for a Midwest school district told industry publication Clean Trucking the district's buses could not heat up in cold weather, lost steering and braking ability at times, had defective frames, and regularly displayed error messages that forced drivers to reset the vehicles.

""The buses do not run for more than a month before needing more repairs,"" Coleen Souza, assistant to the superintendent of Winthrop Public Schools in Maine, told Clean Trucking.

School officials whose districts have not received the Lion buses the Biden administration had promised them are losing hope that their vehicles will ever arrive.

""We have not received any buses,"" Dawn Wallace, superintendent of the Ohio Valley School District in Adams County, Ohio, told the Free Beacon. ""At this point, we are not really hopeful that we will. We will maintain our diesel-powered fleet and, yes, continue to purchase those in the future."" Jason Stabler, superintendent of the Bureau Valley School District in Manlius, Ill., echoed Wallace's concerns.

""The situation remains unresolved at this time, and we are currently waiting to see how it will be addressed and resolved by the court system,"" Stabler said.

Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch told the Free Beacon in a statement that the agency is actively monitoring Lion's bankruptcy proceedings and ""evaluating all options."" She referred the Free Beacon to the Department of Justice for further questions.

Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, told the Free Beacon that the problems Lion's situation present were a predictable consequence of the Biden administration's policies.

""For anyone who thought the transition to EVs would be easy or even profitable, this is yet another example that perhaps there will be large bumps in the road,"" Fisher said.",https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/vice-president-harris-delivers-remarks-on-electric-school-buses-scaled-e1722029972340.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 23:00:26.896052

However, the Trump-era policy shifts from 2017 to 2021 created a volatile landscape, exposing foreign firms to unprecedented strategic and financial risks. This article dissects the implications of these policies on companies like Orsted and evaluates opportunities in resilient sectors and regions that have weathered political turbulence.

The Trump-Era Policy Tsunami

The Trump administration's approach to offshore wind was marked by abrupt regulatory reversals and a pro-fossil fuel agenda. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order halting all federal offshore wind permits, leasing, and project approvals. This pause, initially framed as a temporary review, persisted for years, creating a vacuum of certainty. By 2025, the administration had further compounded the chaos with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which eliminated tax credits for wind and solar projects unless construction began within 12 months of enactment.

For Orsted, the consequences were severe. The company's Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, valued at $4 billion and $924 million respectively, faced delays, impairments, and a forced $9.4 billion capital raise. Orsted's 2023 impairment of $5.7 billion on its Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects—canceled due to permitting delays—highlighted the financial strain. The administration's “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which prioritized oil and gas over renewables, further eroded investor confidence.

Strategic Risks for Foreign Investors

The Trump-era policies introduced three critical risks for foreign firms:

1. Regulatory Uncertainty: Frequent executive orders and permit freezes made long-term planning impossible. Orsted's inability to sell a stake in its Sunrise Wind project—despite 35% completion—exemplifies how political shifts can paralyze capital flows.

2. Financial Volatility: Tax credit cliffs and permitting delays forced companies to accelerate timelines or face losses. Orsted's 2025 impairment of $575 million on the Revolution Wind project underscores the fragility of offshore wind's business model under such conditions.

3. Market Exit Risks: The administration's favoritism toward fossil fuels created an uneven playing field. Shell and Equinor, like Orsted, recorded billions in impairments, signaling a broader retreat from U.S. offshore wind.

Resilient Sectors and Regions

Despite the federal headwinds, certain U.S. states and international markets have demonstrated resilience.

1. State-Level Commitments:

- Washington, Minnesota, and North Carolina maintained aggressive renewable energy mandates, streamlining permitting and grid connectivity to meet clean energy targets. Minnesota's deputy commissioner, Pete Wyckoff, emphasized that wind and solar remain the most cost-effective solutions for meeting electricity demand, even without federal tax credits.

- New York and New Jersey continued to advance offshore wind projects, albeit with delays. The Empire Wind project, though temporarily halted by the Trump administration, resumed after negotiations with state officials.

2. International Markets:

- Europe and Asia have become safer havens for offshore wind investment. Orsted's pivot to projects in the UK, Germany, and South Korea reflects a strategic shift toward markets with stable regulatory frameworks.

- Emerging Markets: Countries like Brazil and Vietnam are fast-tracking offshore wind development, offering growth potential with less political risk.

Investment Advice for Navigating the Storm

For investors, the key lies in diversification and due diligence:

- Prioritize Resilient Jurisdictions: Allocate capital to states with long-term renewable mandates (e.g., Washington, Minnesota) and international markets with stable policies.

- Diversify Portfolios: Balance U.S. offshore wind investments with onshore solar and wind projects in states like Texas, which have less federal regulatory exposure.

- Monitor Policy Cycles: Given the cyclical nature of U.S. energy policy, investors should hedge against political risks by engaging in advocacy or partnerships with state governments.

Conclusion

The Trump-era policies have left a lasting scar on the U.S. offshore wind sector, but they have also revealed opportunities in resilient regions and international markets. For foreign firms like Orsted, the path forward requires adaptability and a focus on jurisdictions where policy stability aligns with long-term strategic goals. Investors who navigate this landscape with caution and foresight can still capitalize on the renewable energy transition, even amid political storms.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 00:00:03.831460

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration plans to make available about 20 metric tons of Cold War-era plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads to U.S. power companies as a potential fuel for reactors, according to a source familiar with the matter and a draft memo outlining the plan.

Plutonium has previously only been converted to fuel for commercial U.S. reactors in short-lived tests. The plan would follow through on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in May ordering the government to halt much of its existing program to dilute and dispose of surplus plutonium, and instead provide it as a fuel for advanced nuclear technologies.

The Department of Energy, or DOE, plans to announce in coming days it will seek proposals from industry, said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The source cautioned that because the plan is still a draft, its final details could change pending further discussions.

The plutonium would be offered to industry at little to no cost — with a catch. Industry will be responsible for costs of transportation, designing, building, and decommissioning DOE-authorized facilities to recycle, process and manufacture the fuel, the memo said.

The details on the volume of the plutonium, industry’s responsibilities in the plan and the potential timing of a U.S. announcement, have not been previously reported. The 20 metric tons would be drawn from a larger, 34-metric-ton stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium that the United States had previously committed to dispose of under a non-proliferation agreement with Russia in 2000.

The Department of Energy did not confirm or deny the Reuters reporting, saying only that the department is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium,” as directed by Trump’s orders.

Boosting the U.S. power industry is a policy priority for the Trump administration as U.S. electricity demand rises for the first time in two decades on the boom in data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

The idea of using surplus plutonium for fuel has raised concerns among nuclear safety experts who argue a previous similar effort failed.

Under the 2000 agreement, the plutonium was initially planned to be converted to mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, to run in nuclear power plants. But in 2018, the first Trump administration killed the contract for a MOX project that it said would have cost more than $50 billion.

The U.S. Energy Department holds surplus plutonium at heavily guarded weapons facilities including Savannah River in South Carolina, Pantex in Texas, and Los Alamos in New Mexico. Plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years and must be handled with protective gear.

Until Trump’s May order, the U.S. program to dispose of the plutonium has involved blending it with an inert material and storing it in an experimental underground storage site called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.

The Energy Department has estimated that burying the plutonium would cost $20 billion.

“Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity. It would entail trying to repeat the disastrous MOX fuel program and hoping for a different result,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The excess plutonium is a dangerous waste product and DOE should stick to the safer, more secure and far cheaper plan to dilute and directly dispose of it in WIPP.”

Investment Advice: A Conditional Buy Rivian's rally is a blend of fundamental progress and speculative momentum.
While the R2's launch and gross margin improvements justify optimism, the stock's valuation remains stretched.","In the volatile world of electric vehicles (EVs), Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has emerged as a polarizing name. Its recent 7.4% stock surge in 2025 has sparked debates: Is this a sustainable rally driven by fundamentals, or a speculative frenzy fueled by short-covering and market hype? To answer this, we must dissect Rivian's financial health, competitive positioning, and the broader EV sector dynamics shaping its trajectory.

Fundamentals: A Mixed Bag of Progress and Challenges

Rivian's Q2 2025 results revealed a 12.52% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.3 billion, driven by a 10-month high in U.S. sales. The company's gross margin improvement—its first positive gross margin in history—is a critical milestone. However, profitability remains elusive, with a wider-than-expected loss of -$0.97 per share and adjusted EBITDA losses projected between $2 billion and $2.25 billion for 2025.

The R2 model, priced under $50,000, is a key catalyst. With over 100,000 reservations and a projected positive gross margin, R2 could unlock mass-market demand. Rivian's $7.5 billion cash reserves and a $1 billion investment from Volkswagen Group (at a 33% premium) further bolster its financial position. Yet, challenges persist: production bottlenecks, the phase-out of federal EV tax credits, and regulatory credit sales declines (from $300 million to $160 million in 2025) threaten near-term margins.

Short-Covering and Market Dynamics: A Volatile Catalyst

Rivian's short interest of 21.18% (151.1 million shares) is among the highest in the EV sector, outpacing Tesla (2.17%) and Ford (4.64%). This creates a short-squeeze risk, especially if the stock continues its upward trajectory. In late July 2025, a 19.6% quarter-over-quarter rally—spurred by robotaxi market speculation and a potential Lyft partnership—forced short sellers to cover positions, amplifying buying pressure.

However, short-covering alone cannot sustain a rally. The EV sector's broader momentum, driven by robotaxi advancements and U.S. manufacturing incentives, has created a tailwind. Rivian's niche in electric trucks and SUVs, coupled with its Amazon partnership (20,000+ delivery vans delivered), differentiates it from pure-play EVs like Lucid. Yet, competition from Tesla's Cybertruck and Ford's F-150 Lightning remains fierce.

Competitive Positioning: Niche vs. Mass Market

Rivian's focus on premium trucks and SUVs has allowed it to avoid direct competition with Tesla's Model 3/Y in the mass-market segment. Its R2 model, however, targets the under-$50,000 bracket—a crowded space dominated by Tesla and emerging rivals like Maverick. While Rivian's brand equity and customer satisfaction scores are strong, its ability to scale production and reduce costs will determine its long-term viability.

Risk-Reward Analysis: Balancing Optimism and Caution

For investors, Rivian presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Key risks include:

- Regulatory headwinds: The loss of federal tax credits and regulatory changes could erode margins.

- Production delays: The R2's 2026 launch timeline is critical; any delays could dampen investor confidence.

- Insider selling: CEO Robert Scaringe and CFO Claire McDonough's share sales in 2025 raise questions about management's conviction.

Conversely, the rewards are substantial:

- Growth potential: The R2 and R3 models could drive revenue to $7.68 billion by 2026.

- Strategic partnerships: Volkswagen's investment and potential Lyft collaborations offer scalability.

- Short-squeeze upside: A sustained rally could trigger a self-reinforcing cycle of buying pressure.

Investment Advice: A Conditional Buy

Rivian's rally is a blend of fundamental progress and speculative momentum. While the R2's launch and gross margin improvements justify optimism, the stock's valuation remains stretched. At $12.49 (as of August 2025), Rivian trades at a 40% discount to its 2023 peak but still carries a price-to-sales ratio of 1.5x, higher than Tesla's 0.8x.

For aggressive investors: A strategic entry point exists if Rivian's share price dips below $10, supported by positive R2 production updates or a short-squeeze catalyst.

For cautious investors: Wait for clearer signs of profitability, such as EBITDA breakeven by 2027 or regulatory clarity on tax credits.

In conclusion, Rivian's 7.4% surge reflects a market betting on its long-term potential. However, sustainability hinges on executing its R2 roadmap, navigating regulatory shifts, and outpacing competitors. For now, it remains a speculative play with asymmetric upside—but one that demands close monitoring of key catalysts.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 04:00:43.360399

Transmission-Scale Energy Storage Incentive Program to Reach 2,000 MW of Energy Storage by 2030 – One of the Most Ambitious Targets in the Nation

Legislation Will Nearly Double Clean Energy Capacity, Reducing Electric Bill Costs

LAWRENCEVILLE – Governor Phil Murphy today signed into law S4530/A5768 and A5267/S4289 as part of the Murphy Administration’s ongoing commitment to addressing the regional energy cost crisis by putting New Jersey on a path to nearly double its capacity to deliver affordable, reliable, and renewable energy by 2030. This legislation will facilitate the swift expansion of solar access for 450,000 additional New Jerseyans, including 250,000 low-income families, which will enable the equivalent of one million households to receive solar power by 2028. These bills will also help lower energy costs by vastly accelerating the construction of energy storage facilities across the state. The Governor was joined by legislative sponsors, local leaders, union members, and advocates at IBEW Local 269 in Lawrenceville.

S4530/A5768 directs the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to open registration by October 1, 2025 for an additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar projects. This will mark a massive expansion of New Jersey’s nation-leading solar programs and help hardworking families and businesses save money on their monthly electric bills.

A5267/S4289 establishes a transmission-scale energy storage incentive program to achieve New Jersey's goal of 2,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030. The program seeks to rapidly install new clean energy capacity and reduce costs for New Jersey’s energy customers.

In an effort to provide necessary energy alternatives, these pieces of legislation allow for the rapid expansion of New Jersey’s community solar program and swift creation of new energy storage facilities. Solar capacity has increased from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts under the Murphy Administration, with solar currently powering the equivalent of over 600,000 homes.

“Today, we are taking immediate and far-reaching steps to lower energy costs for every household in New Jersey,” said Governor Murphy. “By accelerating the process for bringing new sources of energy online and rapidly building new energy storage facilities, we will meet growing demand while also making life more affordable for our state’s families. As part of this process, we are going to create good-paying, union jobs and build a cleaner, more resilient future for every New Jerseyan.”

""I want to thank Governor Murphy for his leadership in advancing clean power solutions for New Jersey,"" said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. ""This legislation addresses real problems. More New Jerseyans will get access to the benefits of expanded community solar programs—one of the best ways for residents to lower their utility bills while contributing to clean energy in the Garden State. And large-scale battery storage will strengthen our electric grid and keep the lights on when we need it most. This is how we build a grid that works for everyone.""

The two bills signed today build upon the Murphy Administration’s ongoing efforts to mitigate rising energy costs due to mismanagement by regional grid operator PJM.

Other notable measures that the Murphy Administration has taken include:

Calling for a formal investigation into the energy cost crisis facilitated by PJM

Announcing $430 million in direct economic relief for New Jersey ratepayers

Sending a bipartisan letter to PJM demanding increased transparency and oversight

Additionally, because Arizona has no significant gas reserves, it must import gas from out of state.
The retirement of renewable energy credits (RECs) is Arizona’s only legal mechanism to ensure exclusive claims over renewable generation, said Lucas Grimes, a senior manager of policy at Center for Resource Solutions.

The Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff Rules (REST) require Arizona’s regulated utilities to source at least 15% of the electricity they sell from renewable sources, 30% of which must come from rooftop solar or other distributed renewable sources.

Nineteen years since its implementation, the mandate has seemingly paid off, with renewable energy accounting for 20% of Arizona’s total net generation, two-thirds of which is from solar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

ACC Vice Chair Nick Myers said the renewable energy mandates are outdated and that utilities should be able to have the flexibility to choose their energy mix themselves without being burdened by government-imposed rules. He said renewable energy mandates drive up costs for customers, but he did not provide support to explain this conclusion.

REST generated gross benefits for utility customers and the public totaling over $1.5 billion for Arizona Public Service (APS) and over $469 million for Tucson Electric Power (TEP) from 2008 to 2018, a 2020 report by Ceres found. The study also found REST resulted in an estimated $12 billion in clean-energy investments.

“It is naive to think that repealing the REST will not have direct impacts on Arizona families,” said Itzel Rios-Vega, Vote Solar’s Interior West regional director. “We urge the commission not to surrender its responsibility to guide Arizona’s energy future.”

For arid regions like Arizona, solar is particularly important because it uses far less water than other forms of generation. From 2008 to 2018, REST played “a crucial role in reducing pollution and delivering substantial water savings of 7,129-acre feet annually- enough water to serve the needs of nearly 44,000 Arizonans each year, an invaluable resource in our arid state,” the Ceres report found.

Additionally, because Arizona has no significant gas reserves, it must import gas from out of state. However, Arizona is drenched in sunshine to tap for energy generation, so much so that it holds the Guinness Book of World Records for “most sunshine.”

The public’s concerns extend beyond clean energy, saving water and lowering costs.

The retirement of renewable energy credits (RECs) is Arizona’s only legal mechanism to ensure exclusive claims over renewable generation, said Lucas Grimes, a senior manager of policy at Center for Resource Solutions.

“Without REST there would be no enforceable REC retirement obligation for regulated utilities,” Grimes said. “Utilities could sell RECs while also marketing the same electricity to customers as ‘renewable’ or ‘clean,’ creating significant risk of greenwashing.”

The public comments that were opposed included:

220 individual public comments from consumers

More than 150 petitions, with 369 signatures on Vote Solar’s petition alone

Dozens of companies and advocacy groups

Government entities and officials

APS was among only public comments explicitly in favor of the repeal. The investor-owned utility said many of its current contractual relationships that resulted from the mandate will still be in effect regardless of whether the standard is repealed. APS cited the payments it receives through rate riders, adjustors and renewable energy programs, authorized by many past commission orders, and said it will still be paid if the mandate is repealed.

Though Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association (GCSECA) said it generally supports the repeal because the rule has burdensome filing requirements. However, it urged the commission to keep the current program, tariffs and surcharges in place and establish a replacement approval process.

The commission’s chair Kevin Thompson has ties to gas utilities, specifically in drumming up new business for gas and pipelines for the business. For over 12 years, he worked for Southwest Gas Corporation, where he was responsible for the gas company’s sale, design and installation of “billions of dollars of natural gas pipelines.”

APS has previously pointed to its ambitious goal for carbon-free electricity by 2050. The utility never made much progress beyond the state’s mandate, and the day before the commission’s decision to repeal the mandate, announced it was abandoning the goal. Instead, APS said it will aim for “carbon neutrality.”

That same day, APS announced a new gas project, which will involve a new transmission line to import gas. APS expects the imported gas will cost $7.3 billion over 25 years, APS parent company Pinnacle West said a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Laying out the regulated utility’s financial developments and outlook, Pinnacle West noted the several actions APS and the ACC took that either increased how much consumers pay to APS or decreased how much APS pays to others, including, but not limited to, multiple rate increases onto consumers, changes to rate designs to reduce “cross-subsidization by certain customer classes (currently ongoing) and so forth.

“None of this should surprise anyone,” Arizona’s Public Health Association said in a statement. “Voters put commissioners in office who openly favor fossil fuels over clean energy.”

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, who was on the ACC when it implemented REST in 2006, wrote a letter to the ACC, outlining the many implications that REST’s repeal would have on ratepayers. She noted the recent Lazard report that said utility-scale solar costs have fallen by 84% since 2009, and a Brattle report for PJM that found utility-scale solar and wind are cheaper to construct than new natural gas, coal and nuclear plants, and how relying on pipelines to important natural gas causes higher electric bills. She outlined the ACC’s failure to provide evidence in its statements that solar is more expensive than gas and increasing costs for its ratepayers, calling it “speculation at best.”

In a signal of a potential lawsuit to come, Mayes said, “In addition to being bad policy, repealing the REST Rules as proposed here is an unlawful abdication of the Commission’s duty to set just and reasonable rates,” she said.

“Ratemaking decisions must be just and reasonable, which means they must be supported by substantial evidence, not arbitrary, and lawfully made. The Commission’s decision must be based on high-quality evidence, not speculation and conjecture.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/26020715143_ab007849a4_5k-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 22:00:21.574523

On 22 August 2025, Ørsted’s subsidiary Revolution Wind LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partner’s Skyborn Renewables, received an order instructing the project to stop activities on the outer continental shelf related to the Revolution Wind project from the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Revolution Wind is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.

The project commenced offshore construction following the final federal approval from BOEM last year. The project is 80% complete with all offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously. This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.

Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits including its Construction and Operations Plan approval letter on 17 November 2023 following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, enough to power over 350,000 homes across both states to meet their growing energy demand. As a reference, South Fork Wind, which is adjacent to Revolution Wind and uses the same turbine technology, delivered reliable energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53% for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.

Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states. Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind.

Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings. Ørsted will, in due course, advise the market on the potential impact of the order on the plan announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement 12/2025) to conduct a rights issue. Existing shareholders and prospective investors are advised to await further announcements by the company.

One of the larger fines, $194,772, was paid in 2019 after findings by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

The explosion and fire at the plant forced an evacuation around the facility for a one-mile radius. Regulatory records show that there are at least 250 homes with 474 residents in that area as of a couple of years ago.

Smitty’s is listed as a “blending and packaging facility for oil and other engine lubricants.” The company’s website states that it stores, blends and distributes products from big name companies such as Penzoil, Quaker State, WD-40, Castrol, Armor All as well as its own brand, Super S.

Smitty’s website says the company was founded in 1969 by Edgar Ray Smith Jr. with his wife, George Ann, joining him three years later. The company says the couple’s four sons joined the business, and eventually purchased the business from their parents in 2000.

The Louisiana Secretary of State lists Edgar Smith as the company’s vice-president. Nobody from Smitty’s could be reached late Friday.

Ford and SK On announced Aug. 19 that its battery plant in West Tennessee was delaying production until 2027.","Election day is approaching for nearly 1,500 workers at an electric vehicle battery plant in Kentucky. Hourly workers at the sprawling BlueOval SK Battery Park will vote on whether to join the United Auto Workers Union.

The National Labor Relations Board has scheduled the secret ballot election for Aug. 26-27.

The election comes amid bitter tensions between workers and the company over safety and health issues.

Nearly a century ago, Ford Motor Company workers in Michigan pushed for safer factories. Today, their counterparts say they’re engaged in the same high stakes fight in Kentucky.

“It’s our time to sit across the table from management as equals,"" says one worker in a video produced by the United Auto Workers Union. “We want a legally binding contract that guarantees our wage, healthcare, PTO policies, and health and safety.”

Safety issues are 'not a joke'

For more than a year, the plant in Glendale, which is a partnership between Ford and South Korea-based SK On, has faced worker complaints over issues including mold, bat infestations, a lack of protective gear, fires, and exposure to dangerous chemicals.

Halee Hadfield works in quality control at BlueOval SK and is one of the workers raising concerns.

“There is enough chemical in this battery park to level all of Glendale and probably more than half of Elizabethtown,"" Hadfield told WKU Public Radio. ""That’s not a joke.”

Health and safety concerns have supercharged the union drive at the Hardin County campus that produces batteries for Ford and Lincoln EVs. At least a dozen worker complaints have been filed with Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health, according to an investigation by the Courier-Journal. Employees reported feeling unsafe working with toxic chemicals and claim there’s been a lack of proper training.

“A worker should have the ability to go to work and then come home and hug their family at the end of the day with two arms and ten fingers,"" said UAW Region 8 Director Tim Smith.

The union vote at Ford comes as another automaker, Hyundai, grapples with worker safety concerns at its battery megaplant in Georgia. Two workers have been killed this year at the facility and several have been injured in recent years.

As of last month, Blue Oval SK had only received one citation from Kentucky OSHA related to fire extinguishers.

""BlueOval SK is proud of our safety record. We constantly strive to improve and adapt our processes and procedures to remain on the leading edge of providing the safest environment possible for our team members,"" said Mark Hayley, Plant Manager of BlueOval's Kentucky 1 plant in Glendale. “Safety is a job that is never done. BlueOval SK maintains a full-time, on-site Safety and Emergency Response Team that operates 24/7 every day the plant is in operation. Safety is our foundation.""

Production operator Bill Wilmoth said workers' concerns have largely been dismissed by the company.

“A union safety committee can help sit down with the safety department to go over issues,"" Wilmoth said. ""Right now, it doesn’t matter if all of us walk in there together or we go one at a time, we don’t get anywhere.""

“Our team members are determined to produce best-in-class batteries,” Assistant Plant Manager Ben Gassman said in a statement. “The UAW will only hold our team back.”

After a supermajority of workers filed in favor of holding a union election in January, the company launched an anti-union campaign that relied heavily on digital advertising.

“Generally, these campaigns are quite effective"", said Professor Ariana Levinson who specializes in labor and employment law at the University of Louisville. ""That’s why employers are willing to spend lots of money on consultants to aid them with these campaigns.”

Were anti-union meetings mandatory or voluntary?

The company faces multiple allegations of unfair labor practices. The UAW alleges BlueOval SK has illegally fired workers for organizing, threatened to close the plant if it becomes unionized, and forced workers to attend captive audience meetings.

Production worker Joshua Urso said the company's ""coffee talks"" are often used to persuade workers to vote against unionization.

""The way it would work at first was, they would tell us some information and plans for the plant, and then at the end, they would throw in something like, 'Hey, vote no,'"" Urso told WKU Public Radio. ""It's definitely a captive audience. They'll tell you it's voluntary, but when it's time for a meeting, a supervisor will tell the whole area, 'Alright everybody, go to the meeting.'""

BlueOval SK declined interviews, but said in a statement that its team members have endured months of ""union sales tactics and slanders"" against their jobs, and are ready for their voices to be heard.

Currently, BlueOval SK is the only electic vehicle battery plant involving the Big Three automakers that is non-union. The UAW notched its first win at a battery plant in Ohio in 2022, followed by another in Tennessee in 2024, and one this year in Indiana.

“This is sort of a watershed moment for this burgeoning EV sector,"" said Eric Dixon, senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, a Louisville-based group advocating for solutions to environmental and energy issues facing Appalachia. “There’s also other benefits, ripple effects, that other workplaces in Kentucky could see because the plant is so large and it’s such a marquee economic development project for the state.”

The organizing success in Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee, is part of the UAW's broader effort to unionize workers at EV battery plants across the country, including in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

The UAW has had mixed success in recent years organizing in the South, a region where many states have right-to-work laws which forbid payment of union dues as a condition of getting or keeping a job.

The UAW lost an election this month at an auto manufacturer in Alabama after experiencing defeat at another plant in that state in 2024.

In 2024, only 8.8% wage and salary workers in Kentucky belonged to a union. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports union membership in the commonwealth was slightly below the national average of just 9.9%.

The Blue Oval SK election is happening in deep-red Hardin County, Kentucky, where 64% of voters in the 2024 election cast ballots for Donald Trump—someone who says he wants to stop the growth of the EV industry.

The makings of 'a historic election'

Voting begins Tuesday, Aug. 26, and the ballot counting will take place the following day after polls close Wednesday at 8 p.m.

If the UAW loses the vote, the National Labor Relations Board allows another election in one year. If the UAW vote is successful, Glendale workers will form their own local and begin working toward a contract.

""I think this is a historic election, not only for Kentucky, but our country and for manufacturing,"" said University of Louisville labor professor Ariana Levinson. ""The UAW had great gains after the Stand Up strike in 2023 and one of their goals was to organize the unorganized, and so I think this bears on the whole manufacturing industry, where we're going in the future.""

Meanwhile, the first electric battery rolled off the assembly line on Aug. 19 in Glendale and will power the all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning. The production launch came four years after Ford and SK On announced plans to build the nearly 1,500-acre campus. The $5.8 billion investment was designed as a twin-plant operation, but only one is currently online.

Construction of the second facility has been delayed due to softer-than-anticipated consumer demand for EVS.

Production in Glendale comes at a time when the U.S. electric vehicle market is facing some uncertainty, including slow EV adoption and the sunsetting of consumer tax credits for purchasing EVs. Ford is reportedly considering options to maximize the Glendale plant’s capacity, including supplying batteries to Nissan.

“Emissions generated from animal waste at CAFOs are highly toxic and are sickening communities across the country,” the original lawsuit stated.","This story was originally published on The New Lede.

Roughly a quarter of the nation’s large cattle, dairy and hog farms are located in just 30 US counties, a new satellite-mapping study has found. The research also links large farms — whether in these dense hotspots or scattered elsewhere — to elevated air pollution.

The study supports concerns about the environmental impacts of factory livestock farms, which drive up air pollution levels by kicking up dust and ammonia in the massive amounts of manure onsite. It also comes on the heels of a federal ruling last week that supported exemptions for animal feeding operations from letting state and local officials know about “dangerous” pollutants, including air emissions.

The ruling sided with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and industry farm groups in continuing an exemption under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and tossed a lawsuit filed by environmental groups.

The environmental groups alleged that the EPA “acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to consider the public’s right to access information” when the agency determined animal waste air emissions no longer needed to be reported.

The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Communications Earth & Environment, is the first to nationally map out the size and location of these farms — called animal feeding operations or AFOs (defined as a livestock operation where animals are kept and fed for more than 45 days in a year) — and estimate their contribution to nearby PM2.5 emissions.

PM2.5 are tiny particulate air pollutants 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair and inhalation of them has been linked to asthma, heart and lung problems and preterm births.

“The meat you eat comes from somewhere. It takes up a lot of space and produces a lot of pollution,” Benjamin Goldstein, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability and senior author of the new study, said in a statement. “And somebody else … has to bear that pollution.”

While experts say the new study is underestimating total AFOs, it adds to evidence that these large livestock operations — which, when large enough, are called concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs — are densely clustered in communities and fouling the air around them.

This study highlights “the inadequacy of existing pollution regulations … [and] demonstrates the urgent need for policy that limits the extreme concentration of concentrated animal feeding operations in rural communities,” Chris Hunt, deputy director of the Socially Responsible Agriculture Project (SRAP), said.

Clustered in certain states, counties

The researchers used existing federal and community data of AFOs and went through satellite data of every US county in the lower 48 states to locate the operations. Their totals are lower than federal estimates.

“We’re not claiming this includes every AFO in the US, but it’s a large enough sample to draw conclusions with confidence,” Dimitris Gounaridis, an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability and co-author of the new study, said in a statement.

Most of the cattle AFOs were in the Midwest and West, which together account for eight of the top 10 cattle AFO states. The top five states were California, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Idaho and Iowa.

This “demonstrates the urgent need for policy that limits the extreme concentration of concentrated animal feeding operations in rural communities.” – Chris Hunt, SRAP

Overall, just 21 counties have 26% of the total cattle AFO operations, and many counties are packed with these industrial farms.

“Five of the top ten counties (Tulare, Stanislaus, Merced, Kings in California, and Weld in Colorado) have more area dedicated to cattle AFOs than some of the top states,” the authors wrote.

A majority of hog AFOs were in the Midwest and South. The top five states were Iowa, North Carolina, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Missouri.

Just 28 US counties have 41% of the hog AFOs, and the top ten states account for 86% of the total operations in the US.

Dr. James A. Merchant, a professor emeritus at the University of Iowa departments of Occupational and Environmental Health and Internal Medicine, said the study is a useful sample of AFOs but “it is not clear if it is representative,” adding that the paper also doesn’t include large poultry farms, which are a potent source of ammonia and drive PM2.5 in AFO-dense areas.

But he said that “focusing on PM2.5 is the right environmental exposure.” The researchers found PM2.5 levels were roughly 28% higher near cattle feeding operations and 11% higher near hog operations compared to similar counties without AFOs. Large livestock farms drive up PM2.5 levels through ammonia in the massive amounts of manure and dust.

“It lingers in the air and can get really deep into your lungs and create scar tissue. It’s nasty stuff. There are really no safe levels of it,” Goldstein said.

In addition, an estimated 1.3 million people who do not have health insurance live within 10 miles of these cattle and hog AFOs.

“Industrial livestock operations have long been known to pose a serious threat to public health and the environment, causing pervasive — yet often overlooked — environmental injustice,” Hunt said.

Challenge to industrial farm air pollution shot down

Environmental groups have for years pushed for more air pollution regulation at AFOs — and last week that effort suffered a major blow. A federal judge shot down a lawsuit brought by Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help and nine other organizations, which were pushing for the EPA to mandate air emissions reporting from animal feeding operations. “Emissions generated from animal waste at CAFOs are highly toxic and are sickening communities across the country,” the original lawsuit stated.

“It lingers in the air and can get really deep into your lungs and create scar tissue. It’s nasty stuff. There are really no safe levels of it.” – Benjamin Goldstein, University of Michigan

US District Judge Timothy Kelly last week, however, wrote that Congress exempted air pollution from animal waste from needing an EPA notification under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).",https://sentientmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Story-Images-2-41.png,N,,2025-08-23 02:59:44.194730

The Chinese lithium market has experienced unprecedented turbulence in recent months, drawing global attention as prices swing dramatically amid supply uncertainties and speculative trading. With lithium being a critical component in electric vehicle batteries, these market dynamics have far-reaching implications for the global lithium market and EV manufacturing sector.

What's Driving Chinese Lithium Trading Volatility?

Chinese lithium trading has reached extraordinary levels of activity and volatility, creating both opportunities and challenges for market participants. The combination of supply constraints, regulatory shifts, and speculative interest has created perfect conditions for extreme price movements.

Record-Breaking Trading Activity

The Guangzhou Futures Exchange witnessed its busiest period in July 2025 since the lithium contract launched in 2023. Trading volumes surged to all-time highs as market participants rushed to take positions amid uncertainty about future supply conditions. According to Bloomberg News, open interest—the number of outstanding bets on prices—also reached record levels, with this momentum continuing well into August.

Daily price swings have frequently hit exchange-imposed limits, triggering a series of regulatory interventions designed to cool the market. The exchange has been forced to implement multiple measures to control what many observers consider excessive speculation.

Price Fluctuations Reach Extreme Levels

Price movements in recent months illustrate the extraordinary volatility gripping the market:

Prices surpassed ¥80,000 ($11,135) per ton in July before retreating to ¥67,840 by month-end

August witnessed a dramatic 30% price surge to over ¥90,000 before moderating to 21% monthly gains

Price fluctuations frequently triggered daily limit mechanisms

In response to these wild swings, the Guangzhou Exchange implemented three separate control measures in July alone, including position caps, trading fee adjustments, and stricter enforcement of price limit mechanisms. These interventions reflect growing concern about market stability and the potential for disruptive speculation.

""Chinese commodity exchanges have a very high share of participation from speculative or individual investors—much higher than commodity exchanges outside of China—which can lead to greater volatility on a daily basis,"" noted Przemek Koralewski, global head of market development at Fastmarkets.

Why Is the Yichun Supply Situation Creating Market Uncertainty?

Supply disruptions in China's key lithium production regions have become a critical factor driving market volatility, with regulatory developments creating particular uncertainty about future production capacity.

Production Disruptions in China's Lithium Hub

In early August 2025, battery manufacturing giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) halted operations at a major mining facility in Yichun after failing to renew its mining permit. This shutdown sent shockwaves through the market, as the Yichun region in Jiangxi province represents one of China's most significant lithium production centers.

The suddenness of the closure caught many market participants by surprise, particularly given CATL's prominence in the battery supply chain. The company's mining operations in Yichun have been a substantial contributor to domestic lithium supply, making the permit renewal failure particularly significant for market sentiment.

Regulatory Environment Tightening

The CATL mine closure has triggered broader concerns about Beijing's approach to lithium mining oversight. Market analysts note that this development suggests a potential tightening of regulatory scrutiny across the sector, with possible implications for other nearby projects.

This regulatory uncertainty has created a battleground between market bulls, who see supply constraints supporting higher prices, and bears, who believe current price levels are unsustainable given the longer-term supply outlook. The situation remains fluid, with market participants closely monitoring regulatory signals for indications of future policy direction.

Several factors have contributed to this heightened regulatory focus:

Environmental impact concerns from rapid mining expansion

Safety standards enforcement after several widely-reported incidents

Quality control issues affecting downstream battery production

Resource conservation priorities from central planning authorities

How Does China's Financial Market Environment Impact Lithium Trading?

The lithium market doesn't exist in isolation—broader trends in Chinese financial markets have significantly influenced trading patterns and investor behavior in the lithium futures space.

The ""Anti-Involution"" Effect

A notable phenomenon known as ""anti-involution"" has swept through Chinese financial markets in recent months, influencing trading patterns across multiple asset classes including lithium futures. This concept—which broadly refers to resistance against diminishing returns despite increased effort—has manifested in market behavior characterized by heightened speculation and contrarian positioning.

According to Bloomberg News, this theme has contributed to the spike in futures activity for lithium, with traders increasingly willing to take speculative positions based on short-term supply concerns rather than long-term fundamentals. The result has been amplified price movements that sometimes appear disconnected from physical market conditions.

Individual investors represent a significantly higher percentage of participants compared to non-Chinese exchanges, creating a market dynamic more susceptible to sentiment shifts and momentum trading. This composition contrast helps explain why price volatility on the Guangzhou Exchange often exceeds what's observed in physical lithium markets.

Exchange Intervention Measures

The Guangzhou Futures Exchange has responded to excessive volatility with multiple regulatory tools:

Position caps limiting the size of new positions traders can establish

Trading fee adjustments designed to discourage speculative activity

Price limit mechanisms that halt trading when daily moves exceed predetermined thresholds

These interventions highlight the delicate balance exchange operators must maintain between allowing price discovery and preventing disruptive market behavior. Despite these measures, price volatility has remained elevated, suggesting the underlying supply concerns and speculative interest continue to dominate market sentiment.

What Makes the Guangzhou Futures Exchange Unique for Lithium Trading?

The Guangzhou Futures Exchange has quickly established itself as the global focal point for lithium price discovery, though its structure and participant composition create distinctive market dynamics.

Market Composition and Behavior

A defining characteristic of the Guangzhou Exchange is its high proportion of speculative and individual investors compared to international commodity exchanges. This participant mix contributes to several observable market behaviors:

Greater daily price volatility than physical lithium markets

More pronounced reaction to news events and supply disruptions

Higher trading volumes relative to physical delivery

Frequent testing of daily price limits

Market experts note that this composition creates both opportunities and challenges. While the enhanced liquidity benefits all market participants, the increased volatility can complicate risk management for commercial users attempting to hedge physical positions.

Contract Specifications and Influence

The Guangzhou Exchange specializes in lithium carbonate futures, trading a refined form of lithium used directly in EV battery production. This specificity makes the contract particularly relevant for battery manufacturers and EV producers looking to manage input cost risk.

""Guangzhou's exchange undoubtedly has a role in how the lithium market transacts,"" noted market development expert Koralewski. ""Ultimately, it's in the discretion of market participants to decide if they want to be exposed to it.""

The exchange has become increasingly influential in global lithium price formation despite its volatility, with pricing from Guangzhou futures contracts often referenced in physical supply contracts and market analysis. This influence has grown as China continues to dominate both lithium processing and EV battery manufacturing.

What's the Outlook for Chinese Lithium Markets?

Market participants and analysts remain divided on the longer-term outlook for Chinese lithium markets, though most expect the current extreme volatility to eventually moderate.

Short-Term Volatility Expectations

Analysts broadly expect elevated price volatility to persist in the near term. According to Citigroup analysts cited by Bloomberg News, the market's ""current sensitivity to policy uncertainty around supply cuts and related news flow"" will likely keep price volatility elevated during the next couple of months.

Several factors contribute to this volatility outlook:

Ongoing uncertainty about regulatory decisions affecting mining permits

Potential for additional production disruptions in key regions

Continued speculative interest from retail investors

Seasonality in demand patterns from battery manufacturers

Market sensitivity to supply-related news remains exceptionally high, with even minor developments capable of triggering significant price movements. This creates challenging conditions for commercial users attempting to manage procurement strategies.

Supply-Demand Balance Projections

The current modest domestic supply deficit is widely expected to reverse in coming months as production normalizes and new capacity comes online. Industry experts anticipate:

Production resumption at several temporarily idled facilities

Gradual regulatory clarity improving operational certainty

New extraction technologies improving recovery rates

Continued investment in processing capacity expansion

Most analysts view the recent price surge as temporary rather than signaling a fundamental shift in market dynamics. The longer-term outlook suggests a return to the structural oversupply conditions that characterized the market before recent disruptions, though the timeline for this transition remains uncertain.

Disclaimer: The lithium market is subject to significant volatility and uncertainty. The projections discussed represent current analyst expectations but may not accurately predict future market conditions. Investors should conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on market forecasts.

How Does This Volatility Impact the Global EV Supply Chain?

The ripple effects from Chinese lithium trading spikes amid volatility and supply concerns extend throughout the global electric vehicle supply chain, creating challenges for manufacturers, suppliers, and investors.

Battery Manufacturing Implications

For battery manufacturers, price uncertainty complicates critical business processes:

Procurement strategies must account for potential dramatic price shifts

Contract negotiations increasingly include flexibility mechanisms

Inventory management becomes more complex amid price volatility

Margin protection requires sophisticated hedging approaches

EV producers face parallel challenges in cost forecasting and pricing strategies. The unpredictability of key input costs makes financial planning more difficult, particularly for manufacturers with longer production cycles or fixed-price sales contracts.

Increasingly, supply chain participants are implementing risk management strategies designed specifically for volatile lithium markets. These include:

Geographic diversification of supply sources

Vertical integration through mining investments

Development of technical alternatives reducing lithium dependency

Implementation of sophisticated financial hedging programs

Investment Considerations

For investors and financial market participants, Chinese lithium market volatility presents both opportunities and risks. Market positioning increasingly requires:

Careful assessment of appropriate exposure levels to Chinese lithium futures

Trading strategies focused on volatility rather than directional price moves

Enhanced risk management protocols given extreme price movements

Deeper understanding of physical market fundamentals

Physical market participants face growing pressure to implement hedging strategies that protect against adverse price movements. This has driven increased interest in options and other derivative instruments that can provide downside protection while maintaining upside potential.

The table below summarizes key risk factors across the lithium supply chain:

FAQs About Chinese Lithium Trading

Why has lithium trading in China become so volatile?

The combination of supply uncertainty in the Yichun region, regulatory changes, and high speculative trading participation has created perfect conditions for extreme price volatility. The shutdown of a major CATL mine due to permit issues has particularly fueled market uncertainty, while the ""anti-involution"" theme in Chinese financial markets has attracted speculative interest beyond typical commodity market participants.

How does Chinese lithium trading compare to other commodity markets?

Chinese commodity exchanges typically have much higher participation from individual and speculative investors compared to international exchanges. According to market experts, this participant composition leads to greater price volatility and more frequent extreme price movements. The lithium market has been especially susceptible to these dynamics given its strategic importance in China's electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem.

What measures has the Guangzhou Futures Exchange taken to control volatility?

The exchange has implemented multiple interventions, including position caps limiting new positions, adjustments to trading fees, and price limit mechanisms that trigger when daily moves exceed certain thresholds. Despite these measures, volatility has remained elevated, suggesting the underlying supply concerns and speculative interest continue to dominate market sentiment.

Will lithium prices continue rising through 2025?

Most analysts predict the recent price surge will be short-lived. As mines resume production and regulatory clarity improves, the current modest supply deficit is expected to flip to oversupply, likely moderating prices in the coming months. However, the timing and extent of this correction remain subject to significant uncertainty, particularly given the potential for additional regulatory developments affecting production capacity.

How should businesses in the EV supply chain manage lithium price volatility?

Companies throughout the EV supply chain are increasingly implementing comprehensive risk management strategies, including:

Diversifying supply sources across multiple regions

Developing more flexible procurement contracts

Maintaining strategic inventory buffers

Implementing financial hedging programs

Investing in R&D for lithium industry innovations

Exploring vertical integration opportunities

The effectiveness of these approaches varies based on each company's position in the supply chain, financial resources, and risk tolerance.

What role does speculation play in the Chinese lithium market?

Speculation has become a significant factor in Chinese lithium futures trading, with individual investors representing a much larger proportion of market activity than in most international commodity exchanges. This speculative interest amplifies price movements and can sometimes create disconnects between futures prices and physical market fundamentals. However, the resulting liquidity also supports more efficient price discovery and risk transfer functions for companies interested in battery metals investment and critical minerals energy security.

With ongoing research into battery recycling breakthrough technologies, the industry hopes to reduce some of the supply pressures currently amplifying market volatility.

By taking a measured approach to resolving these petitions, EPA now has the opportunity to finalize a rule that can provide greater stability and predictability for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program at a critical time for farmers and processors.

“Resolving these petitions is an important step towards bringing certainty to the program and ensuring that the RFS continues to deliver on its promise to support our great farmers and rural manufacturing jobs,” said Devin Mogler, President and CEO of NOPA. “We urge EPA to build on this progress by moving quickly to finalize the 2026 and 2027 RVO in a responsible way that accounts for these waived gallons by ensuring at least 5.25 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel demand while maintaining the imported proposal for imported biofuels and feedstocks. These measures are essential to ensuring the program strengthens domestic markets and keeps investment and jobs in rural America.”

The RFS remains a critical tool for advancing U.S. energy dominance and supporting American farmers and rural manufacturing jobs. By finalizing a rule with robust BBD volumes and a half RIN for imports, EPA can ensure that domestic feedstocks remain the preferred alternative, allowing American farmers and processors to compete on a level playing field.

NOPA will continue to engage with EPA and other stakeholders as the agency works to finalize the RVO and implement policies that deliver lasting benefits for U.S. agriculture, manufacturing, and energy independence.

Shoppers are eager to secure purchases before the federal $7,500 tax credit expires on September 30.
In addition to tax credit concerns, tariffs loom large over the market.
On a more positive note, the used EV market shows encouraging developments.
Many of these vehicles also qualify for the $4,000 used-EV tax credit, which is set to expire alongside the new credit at the end of this month.","The latest report from Cars.com sheds light on the electric vehicle (EV) market, revealing a mix of optimism and concern as new vehicle sales surged 6.6% year-over-year in July. This increase comes despite a notable first decline in dealer inventory since 2022, as consumers rushed to take advantage of deals ahead of impending tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits.

The immediate incentive for buyers appears to stem from a pressing “buy now” mentality. Shoppers are eager to secure purchases before the federal $7,500 tax credit expires on September 30. Although consumers now have more choices than ever, with 75 different EV models available — a 27% increase from last year — the growth in new EV inventory has slowed considerably to only 9% year-over-year. This marks the lowest growth rate since before the Inflation Reduction Act revived federal incentives. Industry analysts predict that the impending loss of tax benefits could lead to a spike in purchases, though subsequent price increases might temper demand, especially since most new EVs fall within the premium-to-luxury price range.

In addition to tax credit concerns, tariffs loom large over the market. Automakers are currently facing an estimated $12 billion in tariff-related costs in the second quarter alone, which they have absorbed to maintain sticker prices. This approach, however, is becoming increasingly unsustainable. Forecasts indicate that if current 25% tariffs remain in place, the average new vehicle price could rise from $48,000 to approximately $54,400 — an increase of around $6,400. Even if trade agreements manage to reduce tariffs to 15%, buyers would still face an average price hike of over $4,000, a significant challenge considering that household incomes grew by only 1% last year.

On a more positive note, the used EV market shows encouraging developments. Year-over-year inventory has increased by 33%, and the average prices for used EVs have dipped by 2%, settling at $36,000. In particular, affordable used EVs priced under $25,000, such as the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, and Chevy Bolt EV, are selling 20% faster than average. Many of these vehicles also qualify for the $4,000 used-EV tax credit, which is set to expire alongside the new credit at the end of this month.

The EV landscape thus presents a complex picture of growth and impending challenges, as consumers scramble to secure favorable deals before significant price increases due to tariffs take effect. The market’s future will largely depend on policy shifts and consumer responses in the wake of these changes.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/July-EV-Sales-Show-Growth-Amid-Tariff-and-Tax-Credit.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 21:04:44.732691

A Compelling Near-Term Investment For investors, enCore's capital raise represents a rare alignment of strategic execution and market opportunity.
Conclusion enCore Energy Corp's $115 million convertible notes offering is more than a financing event—it is a strategic masterstroke that positions the company to lead the uranium sector's green energy transition.
By securing long-term capital, reducing debt, and investing in scalable projects, enCore has created a robust foundation for growth.
As the world pivots toward clean energy, enCore's uranium projects are not just a part of the solution—they are a catalyst for it.","In a bold move to capitalize on the global energy transition, enCore Energy Corp has executed a $115 million upsized offering of 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030, signaling robust investor confidence and positioning the company for accelerated growth in the uranium sector. This strategic capital raise not only strengthens enCore's balance sheet but also aligns with the rising demand for nuclear energy as a clean, reliable power source. For investors, the offering represents a compelling opportunity to back a company poised to benefit from both market tailwinds and operational innovation.

A Capital Structure Designed for Growth and Flexibility

The convertible notes, initially priced at $100 million, were upsized by $15 million after underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment option—a clear vote of confidence in enCore's prospects. The 5.50% coupon rate, combined with a 2030 maturity date, provides the company with a stable, long-term funding source at a time when interest rates are trending upward. This structure avoids the refinancing risks that plague many capital-intensive industries, ensuring enCore can focus on execution rather than short-term liquidity constraints.

The conversion price of $3.2895 per share—a 27.5% premium to the stock's August 19 closing price of $2.58—further underscores the offering's shareholder-friendly design. By setting a price floor, enCore limits immediate dilution while incentivizing growth through upside potential. Additionally, $11.5 million of the proceeds was allocated to capped call transactions, effectively establishing a $4.52/share price floor (a 75% premium to the August 2025 price). This move signals management's commitment to protecting existing shareholders, a critical factor in attracting long-term capital.

Fueling Green Energy Projects with Strategic Capital

The $87.7 million in remaining net proceeds will directly fund enCore's expansion of U.S. uranium projects, including the Alta Mesa Uranium Project in South Texas and the newly acquired Tacubaya land parcel. These initiatives are central to the company's mission to supply low-cost, clean nuclear fuel. The Alta Mesa project, operating under a 70/30 joint venture with Boss Energy Ltd, has already reduced production costs from $100.71 to $59.42 per pound in 2025 through In-Situ Recovery (ISR) technology. With plans to add 75 new wells and increase drill rigs from 24 to 30 by Q3 2025, enCore is primed to scale production while maintaining environmental sustainability.

The Tacubaya acquisition, a 5,900-acre parcel adjacent to Alta Mesa, further extends the project's longevity. Historical drilling data from Chevron Minerals in the 1970s revealed multiple uranium roll fronts, which enCore plans to explore aggressively starting in October 2025. This expansion not only diversifies enCore's asset base but also aligns with U.S. government priorities to reduce reliance on foreign uranium imports. The $1.2 billion federal investment in domestic uranium production, coupled with streamlined regulatory approvals and tax credits for nuclear projects, creates a favorable operating environment for enCore's green energy initiatives.

Shareholder Value and Investor Confidence

The capital raise also addresses near-term debt obligations, with $10.6 million used to repay existing loans. This reduces leverage and improves cash flow flexibility, allowing enCore to allocate resources to high-impact projects. The company's strategic use of convertible debt—rather than dilutive equity—demonstrates a disciplined approach to capital management. By prioritizing debt reduction and capped call transactions, enCore has signaled its intent to balance growth with shareholder protection.

Investor confidence is further reinforced by the underwriting team's involvement. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Haywood Securities Inc. executed a seamless offering, while legal advisors like Sidley Austin and Winston & Strawn ensured compliance with complex securities regulations. The fact that the convertible notes are not registered in the U.S. or Canada until specific dates also minimizes short-term market volatility, allowing enCore to focus on long-term value creation.

A Compelling Near-Term Investment

For investors, enCore's capital raise represents a rare alignment of strategic execution and market opportunity. The company is leveraging low-cost financing to expand its uranium production capabilities at a time when global demand for nuclear energy is surging. With uranium prices supported by decarbonization goals and geopolitical shifts, enCore's position as a U.S.-based, low-cost producer offers significant upside.

The stock's recent performance——reflects growing investor optimism, but the 27.5% conversion premium in the notes suggests there is still room for appreciation. As enCore scales production at Alta Mesa and advances projects in South Dakota and Wyoming, the company is well-positioned to outperform peers in a sector poised for long-term growth.

Conclusion

enCore Energy Corp's $115 million convertible notes offering is more than a financing event—it is a strategic masterstroke that positions the company to lead the uranium sector's green energy transition. By securing long-term capital, reducing debt, and investing in scalable projects, enCore has created a robust foundation for growth. For investors seeking exposure to a company that combines operational excellence with environmental stewardship, enCore offers a compelling near-term opportunity.

Why we are consulting

Delivering clean power by 2030 is at the heart of our mission to transform the UK into a clean energy superpower. Reflecting the urgency of the challenge, the Government has taken early action to deliver this goal including ending the onshore wind ban and establishing GB Energy. The CfD is vital in securing the renewables deployment necessary to deliver clean power by 2030, and the Clean Industry Bonus (CIB) has been introduced to support that deployment with the development of more sustainable offshore and floating offshore wind supply chains.

The response to the CIB in AR7 was strong, with £544 million allocated to support the supply chain. Subject to the Contracts for Difference process, this could leverage up to £9 billion in private investment in cleaner manufacturers, new and upgraded factories, and port infrastructure. We committed to building on the early success of the CIB in the ‘Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan’ under ‘The UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy’, and this consultation invites views on proposed changes to deliver that commitment.

The proposed changes include addressing operational issues identified in AR7, introducing new criteria on workforce protection and skills development, and extending the CIB to onshore wind, as per the manifesto commitment. Together, these changes aim to enhance the CIB’s effectiveness in supporting the clean energy superpower mission, help to develop supply chains that are more environmentally sustainable and deliver economic and social value to the regions that need it most.

Scope of this consultation

The consultation seeks views on proposed regulatory changes to the CIB in support of the aims outlined above. Specifically, we are considering:

Introducing a new criterion aimed at improving minimum levels of workforce protection by encouraging developers and suppliers to commit to discussions on a new offshore wind fair work charter, which will help ensure offshore wind developers and their supply chains offer good jobs, terms and conditions.

Introducing a new criterion aimed at improving minimum investment in skills, encouraging developers to invest either through a pooled fund targeting industry-wide needs or through project-level initiatives, to help build the skilled workforce needed to support the clean energy transition. Though this does not necessitate regulatory change, we are consulting due to the implications for both the CIB criteria and minimum standards.

Expanding the CIB to include onshore wind, recognising its vital role in delivering clean power and the opportunity to support investments in cleaner and shorter supply chains.

Rectifying minor issues from the initial implementation of the CIB in AR7. While the first round of the CIB was successful, we recognise the need to amend some of the processes and refine the scheme so it runs as smoothly as possible for government, developers and the supply chain.

To note, other non-regulatory matters will result in amendments to the CIB Allocation Framework. These will be tested with industry, trade bodies, unions and other relevant stakeholders during the summer.

Clean Industry Bonus scheme description

The Clean Industry Bonus (CIBs) is part of the Contracts for Difference scheme, which is the government’s main mechanism to support the deployment of new low-carbon electricity generation projects in Great Britain.

The Clean Industry Bonus rewards fixed and floating offshore wind developers who choose to invest in cleaner and more sustainable supply chains. The scheme does this by covering the difference in cost between more expensive but more desirable supply chain investments, compared to cheaper but less desirable investments. This is in effect the difference in cost between investing in cleaner or more sustainable facilities, or in a facility (e.g. blades, cables, ports) in a deprived UK area, versus dirtier or less sustainable facilities. By offering extra CfD revenue support for supply chain improvements, the CIB ensures that the “lowest price wins” aspects of the CfD does not inhibit the supply chain investments we need to support our renewables deployment targets and reduce our reliance on polluting suppliers.

The scheme currently features two sustainable criteria. An applicant may be considered to have met Criterion 1, ‘Investment in shorter supply chains’, if an investment is made in an offshore or floating offshore wind manufacturing facility, installation firm, or port located in a UK deprived area. An applicant may be considered to have met Criterion 2, ‘Investment in cleaner supply chains’, if an investment is made in offshore or floating offshore manufacturing facilities or installation firms owned or operated by firms that can evidence having set or committed to a Science Based Target.

To be able to enter a CfD auction, and to apply for extra funding through the CIB, an applicant must have met the CIB ‘minimum standard’ of investment in supply chain sustainability. Currently, this CIB Minimum Standard is for an applicant to have invested at least £100m per GW for fixed-bottom offshore wind farm or £50m per GW for a floating offshore wind farm into facilities meeting the CIB criteria. Once an applicant has met the minimum standard, they can apply for additional revenue support through a competitive process if they choose to invest further under either of these two criteria.

Projects awarded a Clean Industry Bonus will have their commitment written into their CfD contract to ensure delivery. Projects will be monitored at least twice a year to follow progress on delivery. Projects that do not deliver investments will not be paid the Bonus. Partial delivery will only be paid a portion of the CIB equivalent to the portion of their investment delivered. Failure to deliver the minimum standard will incur a corresponding penalty on a developer’s CfD payment.

Proposed reforms to the Clean Industry Bonus

Workforce protection

Clean energy jobs represent the skilled, high-quality employment opportunities of the future, potentially offering good wages, stability, and the chance to build a varied and fulfilling career. These jobs are essential for boosting productivity and driving economic growth. However, there are persistent concerns about workplace standards across parts of the sector, challenges around workforce diversity and wider social inclusion, and there is a mixed picture on trade union access and recognition.

We estimate the offshore wind sector could support up to 100,000 direct and indirect jobs in Great Britain by 2030 . The CIB can play a role in ensuring that high-quality jobs are provided as a minimum, strengthening workforce protections by helping to improve the environment around pay, terms, and conditions. This will support the economic and social sustainability of offshore wind supply chains, encouraging companies that offer good jobs in the communities that need them most. Any CIB measure on workforce protection would be delivered either through CIB minimum standards (i.e. CfD entry requirements) or as a condition to receiving bonuses. The government does not believe that the CIB should offer additional ‘bonuses’ (i.e. more subsidy) for such interventions, as high quality jobs should be provided as a minimum by businesses and bonuses would be difficult to quantify in a way that provides good value for money. Strengthening workforce protection in offshore wind through the CIB may necessitate an addition to regulation 6(2B) of The Contracts for Difference (Allocation) Regulations 2014.

Encouraging commitment to discussions on a new offshore wind fair work charter through the CIB

The government’s lead proposal for AR8 is to encourage commitment, through the CIB, to discussions on a new and ambitious offshore wind fair work charter that is co-developed between the offshore wind industry and trade unions, with government playing a convening role. Various local and devolved authorities across the UK have sought to develop such charters and the government encourages businesses to sign-up where they exist, especially in sectors or areas in receipt of government support, for example in Industrial Strategy Zones.

The development of a new offshore wind fair work charter presents an opportunity for government, industry, and trade unions to build a shared consensus on key issues such as pay, terms, and conditions. We expect an offshore wind fair work charter could include, but would not necessarily be limited to, commitments on pay, job security, health and safety, access to trade unions, and employee wellbeing.

We recognise that we cannot encourage sign-up to a full and ambitious fair work charter in time for AR8, as the lead-in times to negotiate the commitments are not compatible with our desire to publish a draft CIB Allocation Framework in the Autumn. To generate momentum in AR8, we would require commitment to participating in discussions on a fair work charter which would provide a first step towards full implementation of the charter in AR9. Incentivising commitment to discussions on a fair work charter through the CIB in AR8 could help focus industry and trade union collaboration, with the aim of building consensus around a set of meaningful minimum commitments that target some of the remaining challenges on workforce protection in offshore wind. Encouraging discussions on the development of a fair work charter will form part of DESNZ’s Clean Energy Workforce Strategy, to be published in the coming months, and it will reiterate the government’s commitment to exploring how we can encourage fair work through the CIB.

The measures we propose for AR8 are three-fold. First, either CIB minimum standards or bonus eligibility requirements would encourage commitment from developers to discussions on a fair work charter. Second, suppliers could be encouraged to commit to discussions on a fair work charter by making this a condition of their eligibility to be included in CIB investments. These commitments to discussions from developers and suppliers could be either a public commitment, a commitment made as part of CIB minimum standards or eligibility rules, or both. Third, the government would commit to convening widespread representation of all key interests in the discussions, beginning this summer. This would include representation from a range of supply chain firms, along with both offshore wind and floating offshore wind developers and relevant trade unions and workers’ representatives.

This approach to AR8 could provide a genuine step towards implementation of a fair work charter in AR9 that offers commitment to the process from both government and industry. Importantly, it would avoid introducing one-off requirements for AR8 that may distract from, or undermine, discussions on the fair work charter. We could also consider incentivising sign-up to suitable early commitments if agreed by relevant parties prior to Autumn, which could then be reflected in the AR8 CIB Allocation Framework ahead of publication (subject to their design). Once a full fair work charter has been established, we could consider incentivising sign-up via the CIB in AR9, which would provide all parties with sufficient time to engage in meaningful discussions on its design. The government will review the contents of the charter before considering whether and how to incentivise sign-up to the full range of commitments.

Options to incentivise developers to participate in fair work charter discussions

We are considering two options to incentivise developers to participate in discussions on a fair work charter in AR8. These are set out below.

Option one is to require developers to commit to discussions on the fair work charter as part of their CIB minimum standards and to sign up to suitable early commitments if agreed by all relevant parties prior to Autumn through a public commitment. This would require all developers to commit to discussions and any early commitments agreed, with an accompanying financial non-delivery disincentive should they not subsequently participate actively in the discussions and/or subsequently not meet any early commitments agreed. The minimum standard amount (i.e. the financial liability) for developers could be increased, with performance related adjustments applied proportionately for non-delivery. This would align closely with the existing design of the CIB, but we recognise the challenge in determining an appropriate minimum standard amount reflective of commitment to a fair work charter.

Option two is to make developers’ eligibility to apply for CIB bonuses conditional on their public commitment to discussions on the charter and any early commitments agreed. Upon application, there would be no financial non-delivery disincentive put in place for those developers that did not wish to commit, but they would not be able to apply for bonuses. If, however, a developer was to receive a CIB bonus but later withdrew their commitment to the discussions or any early commitments agreed, they would be denied their bonus payment as they would no longer meet the eligibility requirements. This option would avoid an increase to the minimum standard amount, but risks a negative impact on investment made through the CIB.

Options to incentivise suppliers to participate in fair work charter discussions

With regard to suppliers, we are also considering two options to encourage commitment to discussions on, and the principle of, a fair work charter. These are set out below.

Option one is that, to be eligible to be included in a developer’s CIB investment proposal under criterion 1, we could require some or all supply chain firms to make a public commitment to discussions and early commitments agreed on the fair work charter. To minimise resource and cost burdens, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – and / or firms with smaller contract values - could be exempted, though we would strongly encourage firms to commit to discussions on the charter where possible. New facilities may also be exempt from committing to discussions in acknowledgement they would face additional challenges to participation. This option has been designed to encourage commitment and sign-up to the charter across the supply chain, without increasing costs or burden for SMEs or new facilities. Again, we recognise new eligibility conditions may risk a negative impact on investment made through the CIB.

Alternatively, option two focuses on suppliers’ eligibility to receive Industrial Growth Plan (IGP) funding via the CIB. Currently, suppliers can receive IGP funding from developers’ contributions to the IGP Delivery Body (a role assumed by the Offshore Wind Growth Partnership as part of their CIB minimum standard obligations. Under option two, suppliers would only be eligible for this funding if they commit publicly to discussions on the fair work charter. However, suppliers who do not make this commitment would still be eligible to be included in CIB investments. While this may lead to less commitment to developing a fair work charter compared to option 1, it could have less impact on investments made through the CIB.

As set out above, ahead of AR9, the government could consider requiring sign-up to a full fair work charter subject to the result of the discussions and the commitments included. As part of its considerations, the government could utilise a tiered approach to sign-up across the supply chain as an eligibility condition to being included in CIB investments under criterion 1 or via the IGP. In practice, this could mean that the largest firms are expected to sign-up to implementing the charter in its entirety and less-large firms expected to sign-up to the majority of the charter but not every aspect. SMEs – and / or firms with smaller contract values - may not be required to sign-up while new facilities could be provided with more time to sign-up.

Skills

The government is committed to driving an increase in the capacity of our domestic clean energy workforce to match the scale of clean energy deployment, and to ensure the UK has the skills needed to deliver the Clean Energy Mission.

The Office for Clean Energy Jobs ‘Assessment of the clean energy skills challenge’ , as part of the ‘Clean Power 2030 Action Plan’, provided a basis for government to better understand the 2030 workforce requirements and support targeted skills planning. It pointed to common challenges that cut across clean energy sectors, including competition for skills, awareness of opportunities, equality and diversity, an ageing and retiring workforce, and barriers to training. Despite the scale of the skills needs, there has been a steady decline in employer investment in training over the last decade, with real terms investment per employee down 19% since 2011.

The government aims to create the right conditions and incentives for industry to invest in current and future skills requirements. Previously, the government requested developers to submit, for approval, Supply Chain Plans (SCPs) to be eligible to enter a CfD Allocation Round. These SCPs included a requirement for developers to give an overview of the skills commitments they were making to meet the aims and objectives of the Supply Chain Plan Policy.

Encouraging investment in skills through the CIB

As set out in the ‘Industrial Strategy: Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan’ , the government is now considering introducing a skills criterion into the CIB for AR8, which could help accelerate investments in skills as part of wider government efforts to meet our 2030 targets. We recognise the work that many industry players already do on skills throughout the project lifecycle, including through community benefit funds, but we see a gap for the CIB to set some minimum requirements in this space given the scale of the clean energy superpower mission. The aim is that such requirements would complement rather than displace the offshore wind industry’s existing skills investments.

We see two alternative ways of introducing a skills criterion into the CIB, which we would like to test through this consultation. Both would form part of CIB minimum standards rather than offering CIB bonuses as we consider that investment in future capability should be provided as a minimum and bonuses would be difficult to quantify.

Option 1: Developers could be incentivised to contribute towards a “skills investment fund” that encourages a more collaborative approach.

Option 2: Developers could be incentivised to invest in skills at the project level.

Option 1 – Incentivise contributions to a “skills investment fund”

In this option, the CIB would incentivise contributions from developers to a “skills investment fund”, to be administered and operated by a third-party. This could enable industry, with government partnership, to channel investment to where it is needed most and in ways that individual projects cannot manage alone. The government recognises the challenge to establish a GB-wide skills investment fund given the importance of regional and local interventions and note that education and skills policy is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

We engaged with stakeholders ahead of this consultation to examine how CIBs could be used to help address skills challenges in the sector. Our early engagement suggested that the CIB could be used as a mechanism to incentivise a more collaborative approach to skills investment. Such an approach would allow for interventions that target industry-level challenges, with the potential to align interventions with wider government skills policy as well as the ‘Offshore Wind Industry Council People and Skills Plan 2024’ . There is also an opportunity for a skills investment fund to support engagement with under-represented groups in the sector, which could help promote social mobility and attract a broader talent pool. Promoting industry leadership in this space, with government playing a convening role, could help to stimulate coordinated skills interventions that complement existing activities, avoid duplication and maximise impact.

The government recognises the challenge to establish a GB-wide skills investment fund given the importance of national, regional and local interventions, and it is essential that any such fund delivers for offshore wind projects and workers across GB. In recognition that skills is a devolved matter, we would continue to engage with the Scottish and Welsh governments to ensure they can input into the distribution of funds. We would aim to align with current and future strategy, including the upcoming ‘Offshore wind skills action plan’ which is being jointly developed by the Scottish Government, industry, public sector delivery partners and trade unions. The government would also continue to engage with industry to ensure that a skills investment fund complements – rather than replaces – developers’ ongoing work at the regional and local levels.

The IGP Delivery Body could be well-placed to administer a skills investment fund, particularly given the existing link with the CIB and its remit to make strategic, targeted investments. Currently, developers can choose to contribute part of their CIB minimum standard amount to the IGP Delivery Body, as long as it is used to support investments that meet the CIB criteria. In AR8, to cover the costs of a skills investment fund and to provide a level playing field among developers, the CIB could require that a proportion of developers’ minimum standard contributions are put towards the IGP Delivery Body. Alternatively, the voluntary approach could continue. If the IGP Delivery Body is responsible for administering both the skills and supply chain contributions, the amount of funding reserved for skills could either be decided by the strategy function of the Body itself, or the government could require that a minimum amount of funding is reserved for skills.

In terms of distributing funds, the CIB Allocation Framework would set guidance in relation to eligible investments that a skills investment fund could target. The government would look to engage extensively with the devolved governments, industry and expert bodies to provide a suitable list of eligible investments, which might include support for training programmes and materials, for career development programmes, or for new training facilities and equipment. This list is by no means exhaustive, and the skills investment fund could be used to support a range of investments, including those that benefit key regions for offshore wind such as coastal areas around the North Sea, Celtic Sea and Irish Sea.

The government would look to work with the IGP Delivery Body’s Strategy Board, which includes representation from the devolved governments, to ensure there is sufficient skills expertise in place to identify high quality skills interventions that align with broader industrial strategy. Suitable expertise and experience would be needed to monitor the delivery and performance of the skills interventions taken forward. In practice, this could mean that a range of stakeholders would be involved in the distribution and delivery of a skills investment fund. We will look to align with - and utilise the expertise of - the Department for Education, devolved administrations and government agencies such as Skills England and Skills Development Scotland.

We recognise that developers contributing to the fund would be ceding control of how money is spent, and it is conceivable that some individual projects entering AR8 may not benefit directly. We would expect that contributing developers would be able to provide views on the investments to prioritise through industry forums, which could provide opportunity to prioritise initiatives where the benefits can be realised within AR8 projects’ lifetimes.

Option 2 – Incentivise investment in skills at the project level

A second option (option 2) would be to introduce a skills criterion into the CIB that requires investment in skills at the project level. This could mean setting an amount of a developer’s CIB minimum standard contribution that needs to be spent on skills training activities for their own project. It would be for a developer to decide on how they would spend their minimum standard obligation to meet their skills requirements within an eligible list of skills activities. The eligible list of activities could include:

Support for education attainment and upskilling

Support for training providers

Training facilities and equipment

Work experience and internships

The above list could encompass a wide range of interventions that are impactful and for which it is straightforward to evidence financial spend, in keeping with the existing CIB framework. We have considered other activities, such as ‘career progression’, but found that it was either more difficult to define tangible outcomes or more burdensome for developers to evidence spend and monitor outcomes.

The government would engage further with the sector before setting an appropriate minimum standard contribution level for skills training. Recognising that education and skills policy is a devolved matter, the relevant devolved governments will also be engaged in the process of agreeing on minimum standards. Should a developer fail to meet the minimum standard requirement for investments in the skills criterion, they would automatically have a Performance Related Adjustment applied, in the normal way, to their future CfD payments, proportional to the level of non-delivery.

A project-by-project approach would enable the CIB to set minimum standards on skills investment in a way that aligns closely with the existing framework. It may not produce the same level of impact that a more collaborative approach might do through economies of scale, however it would provide individual developers with greater control over the skills interventions they wish to invest in. This could allow developers to concentrate their investments in interventions and regions that produce direct benefits for current or future projects.

Onshore wind

The government is examining whether and how Onshore Wind (ONW) could be included into future auction rounds.

Eligibility

Onshore wind deployment is critical to the government’s clean power mission. The Clean Power Action Plan set ambitious targets of near-doubling onshore wind capacity, from 16.3GW of currently installed capacity up to 29GW by 2030. The government has taken key steps to support accelerated deployment of this critical technology, including lifting the de facto onshore wind ban in England within 72 hours of taking office and establishing the Onshore Wind Taskforce bringing together government, industry and trade unions to set out ambitious reforms to planning, grid connections, and routes to markets.

A strong supply chain offer will be essential to support our onshore wind capacity targets and harvest the benefits of increased deployment. The Onshore Wind Strategy, published on 4 July this year, outlined key actions for ensuring strong and sustainable supply chains. This included improving the quality of onshore wind supply chain data to support future policy decisions, and in tandem, exploring what government can do now to support the onshore wind industry. Expanding the CIB to include onshore wind could create momentum for investment in the sector’s supply chains.

We recognise the challenges of introducing this new technology in the scheme. The relatively smaller size of ONW projects means each has a comparatively small amount of market pull – often purchasing “off the shelf” for multiple projects at once rather than doing bespoke orders from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). There are also other barriers to greater investment such as the current trend of ONW OEMs rationalising (rather than expanding) their supply chains, regulatory differences between regions and concerns over rising costs. We recognise that the CIB needs to be one of several policies supporting the sector’s growth, alongside other policies trailed in recent strategic documents. In developing this policy, we have been mindful of wider work in this space, including Scotland’s onshore wind sector deal. This consultation includes proposals which, should onshore wind be included in the scheme, would aim to maximise opportunities for the sector while providing good value for money for the billpayer.

We welcome views on the opportunities and challenges of introducing onshore wind into the Clean Industry Bonus. This includes views on whether the scheme should be expanded for Allocation Round 8 or Allocation Round 9. While onshore wind in the CIB from AR8 would offer industry with a tangible opportunity to invest in cleaner and shorter supply chains, this may present a challenging timeline for developers and suppliers to familiarise themselves with the scheme and construct high-quality bids. Including onshore wind in the CIB from AR9 would allow more time for industry to consider how they could capitalise on the opportunities offered by the scheme and create strong bids. However, as 2030 approaches we are aware introducing support later may limit its impact.

From a legal perspective, the proposal to include onshore wind in the scheme would result in regulatory amendments that would allow the Allocation Framework to set which technologies would apply during an applicable Clean Industry Bonus round. This would build flexibility into regulations, should the government wish to make further changes to the scheme at a later date.

Components

As components for ONW and OFW are largely distinct, we are proposing using a separate bespoke list of components to be available for CIB extra funding:

CIB eligible components ONW

Blades

Towers

Hubs

Nacelles

Gearboxes

Generators

Cables

Other Electrical Infrastructure including Converters

Transformers

Wider Balance of Plant

Foundations

Criteria

As laid out elsewhere in this consultation, we are also considering including further criteria on skills and workforce for OFW. As introducing ONW into the CIB would be new for the industry, we are currently proposing that if ONW is introduced it would only be required to meet either of the first two criteria introduced in AR7, namely short supply chains and sustainable supply chains.

Criteria 1: short supply chains

Should we include ONW into the CIB we are currently planning to retain the same map of UK deprived areas that would qualify suppliers for additional CIB funding. This would remain consistent between OFW and ONW technologies and retains existing rationale for inclusion into the scheme, which is that funding should be channelled where it is needed most. We do acknowledge that fewer ONW suppliers currently exist within UK deprived areas, and this may have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the auction. This is mitigated in part by the presence of a second criteria and budget revision mechanisms (see ‘process improvements’ section), which will ensure that the scheme only funds bids that are considered to provide value for money.

Criteria 2: sustainable supply chains

Suppliers demonstrating that they have considered science-based targets towards decarbonising is a key part of creating sustainable supply chains across industries. By agreeing to let the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTI) review these targets suppliers demonstrate their commitment to implementing feasible decarbonisation strategies within their organisations.

Developers can meet their minimum standard commitment by investing in a supplier signed up to the Science Based Target Initiative. Developers can put forward a CIB extra proposal to request a bonus in return for investing in a proportion of suppliers that set SBTIs across the components listed above. For offshore wind, this proportion is set at 40%, which reflects what would be expected in a business-as-usual scenario. While the scheme is intended to encourage sign up to SBTI, we recognise that fewer ONW suppliers are signed up to the SBTI than for OFW. We propose that the minimum is set at 30% for onshore wind, which means that at least 4/11 of the components listed above will need to be sourced from suppliers that sign up to the initiative to obtain extra CIB funding. This was judged to be an appropriate minimum SBTI coverage from supply chain data which shows the suppliers available for each component which has signed up to SBTI.

Portfolio-level bids

As laid out above, much of the procurement for ONW projects is done at the portfolio level due to the size of the projects. This enables economies of scale to significantly reduce project costs. To preserve developers’ capacity to maintain these savings, we propose to allow applications to be placed at the portfolio level, matching the level which industry already conducts much of its procurement.

In practice, this means a developer owning several projects would only need to make one CIB application, reducing the administrative burden of the scheme for developers, suppliers and government alike. A similar proposal is put forward for offshore wind applications – please refer to the ‘process improvements’ section of this consultation, as details differ to reflect differences in size of projects.

An application would have to list all projects included in its portfolio application. However, the applicant would not have to specify which project would be delivering the applicable minimum standard and/or CIB extra proposals at the point of application. Instead, this would occur after the CfD auction, when CIB minimum standard and extra proposals could be attributed to winning projects upon contract signature.

For onshore wind, the following definitions would apply:

Portfolio: A portfolio is a set of projects, to a minimum of one, owned by the same entity (or set of entities).

Project: The totality of a leased/owned area of land for which the bidding entity/entities obtain, or will obtain, relevant planning permission. For onshore wind, a project is assumed to be a CfD unit.

Minimum Standards

Minimum standards are set to ensure developers meet a baseline level of investment into the supply chain prior to applying for additional CIB funding. This is not set to act as a barrier to taking part in the scheme but to ensure that this scheme represents a good value for money investment for the Government.

To reflect differences in project costs and supply chains, the minimum standard for ONW could also be set lower than for OFW. Our current proposal is to set the minimum standards at £25m/GW, approximately 2% of project construction costs. Based on available supply chain information, this was judged to be a reasonable expectation of current business-as-usual investments into more deprived areas or cleaner supply chains, noting the lower number of eligible suppliers compared to the OFW supply chain, where minimum standards represent approximately 6% of project construction costs. We believe this level will enable projects to meet the minimum standard as part of their natural project expenditure. We recognise that this was calculated using a limited evidence base and commercial expertise and welcome further evidence to inform this figure.

We recognise that ONW projects are a lot smaller than OFW projects and have taken this into consideration when designing this proposal. Smaller projects may find it difficult to shoulder the administrative burden of engaging with the minimum standards process. There is also a concern that applying the same minimum standard as offshore wind would be unreasonable, given the differences in supply chains.

To address the concern related to administrative burden, we are proposing to apply a minimum standard requirement only to projects above a certain threshold of generation capacity. Below this threshold, projects would not be required to meet the CIB minimum standards in order to enter the CfD round. However, if they choose to apply for additional funding through the CIB, they would need to meet the minimum standard as part of their application. We propose that the threshold be set at 100MW, in line with Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) requirements which will be coming into effect at the end of 2025. This approach allows smaller projects to participate in the CIB scheme without imposing an undue barrier to entering a CfD round. In addition, the requirement for all projects to meet minimum standards if they wish to bid for CIB funding would help ensure that consumers pay for investments above and beyond ‘business as usual’.

For developers placing portfolio-level bids, the minimum standards applied would be in relation to the total project capacity included in the portfolio. For example, three 50MW projects would have a combined generating capacity of 150MW and would be required to engage with the minimum standards as set out above. However, should only a subsection of projects within a portfolio be successful at the CfD auction round, developers would only be required to meet minimum standards proportional to the total capacity of the successful CfD bids.

Budget

The current budget of the CIB is set out as follows: there is one primary budget for all bids, within which there is a “sub-budget” for Floating Offshore Wind (FLOW). This sub-budget represents ringfenced funds for FLOW, beyond which any additional FLOW bids would need to compete with other OFW bids. This sub-budget is hidden in order to maintain competitive tension and can be adjusted at the budget revision stage by the Secretary of State.

To recognise the fact that OFW bids will benefit from greater economies of scale and more mature supply chains, we propose to create a separate sub-budget for onshore wind. This would ringfence funding for ONW, allowing for the Secretary of State to take advantage of any opportunities while also allowing funding to be transferred to OFW bids should there be a low number of bids, or to protect value for money if ONW bid quality is low. Similarly, in order to preserve competitive tension between ONW bids, we would keep the initial amount the sub-budget is set at hidden and retain the Secretary of State’s ability to adjust the sub-budget at the budget revision stage, including not to fund any bids if value for money is deemed poor. This and other regulatory changes related to sub-budgets are explained in more details in the ‘process improvements’ section of this consultation.

Process improvements

The first round of the CIB received a large number of applications, with all stakeholders successfully applying and meeting eligibility requirements, and no applicant using the appeals process. However, we identified a number of improvements in the process, or areas that would benefit from clarifications. In this section, we are proposing to amend inefficiencies or ambiguities where they are set in the CIB regulations or in the contract. Others arising from the Allocation Framework will be resolved separately later this summer.

Timelines

The current legislation governing the CIB process includes the following statutory deadlines:

Process Statutory deadline - Publication of CIB framework notice (notice of CIB application window opening and provisional budget notice) 3 months before CIB application window opening. - Final Allocation Framework published 30 days before CIB application window opening. - Final budget notice 3 weeks after CIB application window closing. - CIB results released 50 working days after the CIB application window closing. - CfD round able to launch 4 months after CIB application window opening.

Assuming one month between the CIB opening to applications and closing, these statutory deadlines mean that the theoretical minimum amount of time between a notice of a CIB application window opening and the subsequent CfD application window opening is 7 months.

Statutory deadlines should aim to strike a balance between giving stakeholders appropriate lead-in times ahead of each CIB round, providing transparency in timings, and allowing for key government policy where high-value contracts are at stake to move rapidly. The interaction between CIB timelines and the government’s commitment to deliver annual CfD rounds is particularly critical. The first round of the scheme highlighted timeline inefficiencies and constraints, which require fixing.

We are minded to amend the scheme’s statutory timelines, with the aim to reduce overall time between a CIB round notice and a CfD round. This is to ensure that the government is able to deliver on its commitment to deliver annual CfD rounds, and that the CIB and CfD auctions run in a smooth sequence. Now that industry is more familiar with the CIB process, we are confident that industry can adequately prepare in shorter timescales.

We propose to amend the current legislative timelines in the following way:

Publication of a notice of CIB application window opening and provisional budget notice: we propose that the Allocation Framework specify, round on round, when the notices related to a CIB application window opening and provisional budget would be published. We recognise the importance of communicating CIB application window timelines well in advance, as the success of a round is in part predicated on giving potential applicants sufficient lead-in times to prepare applications. Please find below a proposed timeline, including circulating a draft Allocation Framework to industry stakeholders in Autumn 2025 and launching a CIB round in March 2026.

Final Allocation Framework published: 5 days before CIB round opening. In practice, as set out below, we plan to share a complete draft of the Allocation Framework in Autumn 2025, which can be amended following engagement with stakeholders. Any amendments to the Allocation Framework following the publication of the Government Response to this consultation would be kept to fixing errors or clarifying policy.

Final budget notice: as with the provisional budget notice, we propose that the Allocation Framework determine round on round when the final budget notice would be issued. This could include a backstop for the final budget notice to be issued by the time the first CIB statement is released. This would provide government flexibility to vary timelines to account for timing requirements of future rounds. For AR8, we propose that the final budget notice be issued 25 working days after the CIB application window closing date. Compared to AR7, this allows for more time for government to assess CIB bids and set a final budget, though it does not increase the overall results processing time (see next line).

CIB results released: 35 working days after the CIB round closing.

CfD window able to open: as soon as reasonably practicable.

While the aim of these proposals is for government to move quickly and flexibly between scheme delivery milestones, this does not come at the expense of early engagement with stakeholders and overall predictability in the timeline. For full transparency, if the above proposals are implemented, the provisional intended AR8 CIB timings are as follows:

Engagement on a draft Allocation Framework September 2025. Government will update and refine the framework iteratively following industry feedback. Publication of a government response and a complete Allocation Framework draft November 2025. Government lays legislation on CIB AR8 December 2025. Government publishes a provisional budget and notice of CIB round opening as soon as the regulations are in force, likely February 2026. Final Allocation Framework is published as soon as the regulations are in force, likely February 2026. CIB round opens early March 2026. CIB round closes mid-March 2026 (two week long window). CIB results are released by end of May 2026. CfD round is able to launch after CIB results are released.

Budget

According to current regulations, the Department must set a provisional budget available to applicants for a CIB allocation round, and communicate this with industry ahead of the round. This budget can be revised, with the final budget announced within 3 weeks of the CIB round closing.

The AR7 CIB Allocation Framework made provisions for a sub-budget, dedicated to supporting investments in floating offshore wind. This meant that bids for certain floating offshore wind components were able to compete against each other for a ring-fenced budget, instead of competing in the ‘main pot’ against fixed offshore wind bids. This recognised the specificities of the floating offshore wind industry, including different componentry and investment needs. The value of the ring-fenced budget was not communicated publicly in order to preserve competitive tension within this sub-budget and ensure applicants placed value for money bids.

We are proposing to formalise the creation and functioning of sub-budgets in regulations to remove any ambiguity between the regulations and the allocation framework. We propose to continue using sub-budgets for floating offshore wind at least for AR8. Should onshore wind be included in the scheme (see elsewhere in the consultation), an onshore wind sub-budget could also be created.

From a legislative perspective, we propose that amendments to the regulations grant powers to set budget structures, round on round, through the Allocation Framework. This would provide government with flexibility to apply different budget structures depending on upcoming round’s design specificities (e.g. technologies included) and expected value for money. This would include:

Powers to set a sub-budget, or a ‘flexible minima’, recognising the different needs of certain applicants, such as floating offshore wind or onshore wind applicants. The Allocation Framework could also clarify the interactions between the sub-budgets and the general budget, with any unused funds from sub-budget able to be used in the general budget.

Powers to set separate budget ‘pots’: whilst we do not propose to use this power for AR8, the purpose of this proposal is to future-proof regulations against a variety of possible budget structures, which may be deemed to offer better value for money or be easier to administer in the future.

Powers to set a ‘maxima’: this refers to a hard cap on the amount that can be spent on bids of a certain category, e.g. bids related to a particular technology.

Powers to keep the value of the overall budget and/or of sub-budgets hidden, to preserve competitive tension if deemed appropriate.

Powers to increase or decrease the value of the overall budget and of sub-budgets, including to zero, as part of the budget revision process occurring within the period after the CIB window closed and before the auction is run.

Events outside a generator’s control

The AR7 CIB Guidance describes the process to follow in the event that a generator cannot deliver a CIB commitment due to unforeseen circumstances outside of their control. This includes proposing one or several alternative minimum standard investments. As a last resort, it also allows for the Secretary of State to deem that a generator has met minimum standards when a commitment has not been delivered due to circumstances outside of the generator’s control, when every reasonable effort to deliver the original or alternative commitments have been made.

We propose cementing this principle into regulations, with a clause stating that the Secretary of State may deem a generator to have met minimum standards even in the absence of an investment, due to events or circumstances outside of their control.

Budget notice

The provisional and final budget notices included a budget expressed in millions of pounds per gigawatt of capacity entering the auction. The original intent was to vary the budget to reflect the number of projects bidding into the auction. However, we note this created confusion amongst applicants that a project may not be able to win more than the £m/GW figure for its size.

To simplify this, we propose changing regulations to enable government to express the provisional and final budget in absolute terms rather than in £m/GW terms.

Sunset clause

Regulations currently stipulate that the Clean Industry Bonus may apply to the seventh, eight, or ninth CfD allocation rounds. We propose to extend this sunset clause, so that the CIB may be applied to rounds opening prior to 31 December 2028. This would align the scheme’s timeline with the government’s clean power mission, by extending this support to the last projects receiving a CfD that could deliver renewable energy generation by 2030. Regulations would provide for government to apply the scheme to an upcoming CfD allocation round by issuing a notice.

Payment on delivery

The scheme currently allows for applicable CIB payments to be released to generators once the project has been successfully commissioned and CfD generation payments begin. In practice, these will appear as a ‘reconciliation amount’ in respect of a billing period as nominated by the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), which administers the CfD. Payment amount and frequency will be determined by the LCCC to ensure that generators receive the full amount owed for their CIB Extra Proposals by the end of the fourth year after either their Start Date (or of their extension if applicable) or the date at which the LCCC is satisfied that it is aware of the Secretary of State’s determination that CIB Extra Proposals have been met.

This payment system means that an applicant is likely to receive CIB payments 1-3 years after relevant supply chain investments have been made, given these investments occur in the capital expenditure phase of a project. This means a debt-financed project carries the investment debt longer before CIB payments can offer financial relief, which is assumed to increase overall project financing cost and may increase the cost of the CIB bid itself.

To improve this payment timeline, we are considering the following options:

Enable payments to be made before the CfD Start Date upon release of the Implementation Statement. This means payments can be made after all investments (towards minimum standards and CIB extra proposals) have been made, but before CfD generation starts. This would improve payment timelines for generators whilst ensuring all supply chain investments have been verified, with payments released corresponding to level of delivery.

Enable payments to be made before the CfD Start Date, upon proof that the total share of the CIB extra proposals investments from the generator has been made, demonstrated through a conditional Implementation Statement. This would enable payments to be released once investments related to extra proposals have been made, but before those related to the minimum standards have been completed. This could significantly improve payment timelines for generators and may result in a more significant decrease of project financing costs and potentially the cost of CIB bids themselves. However, to protect against non-delivery of minimum standards, a claw-back mechanism would need to be designed for the LCCC to be able to retrieve funds from the generators.

In both cases, the benefits of earlier payments should be considered alongside the impact of bringing the cost of CIB for AR8 and future rounds forward on consumer bills.

For both options, we propose to maintain the current spread of payments, that is, that payments will have been fully paid to the generator by no later than the end of the 4th year after the date at which the LCCC has been made aware that the CIB Extra Proposals have been fulfilled. The government’s position is that a four-year payment window continues to provide the right balance between rewarding developers for their CIB investments whilst mitigating impact of the scheme on consumer bills.

Project-level bids

The policy intention for the CIB was for each offshore or floating offshore wind project to prepare one application and be released with one CIB Statement. This would have mirrored the process under Supply Chain Plans (the CfD supply chain legacy policy), which developers are familiar with. As CIBs mapped themselves onto CfD units, and as it is not uncommon for developers to split a large offshore wind project into several CfD units, this resulted in developers being required to complete several CIB applications per project. This significantly increased the administrative burden for developers, suppliers and government alike.

To rectify this, we are considering creating the option for project-level bids. In regulatory terms, this means removing the limitation on applications per unit, with the Allocation Framework setting out the options for project-level bids. This would be available to both offshore (fixed and floating) and onshore wind projects should they be included but would work slightly differently to reflect the different project sizes and ownership structures. For a description of the onshore wind mechanism, please refer to the onshore wind section in this consultation on ‘portfolio-level bids’.

For fixed and floating offshore wind, this would mean multiple CfD units in the same leasing zone could put forward a single CIB application. The applicant would not have to specify number or size of units at CIB application stage; though they will have to communicate to DESNZ the names and sizes of all units prior to the CfD auction round opening, so these can be added to the CIB Statement, for NESO to be able to complete checks. Applicants would only have to specify which units would be delivering the project’s minimum standard and/or CIB extra proposals after the CfD auction, where CIB minimum standard and extra proposals could be attributed to winning units upon contract signature.

We would define key terms in the following way:

Project: The totality of a leased area of sea for which the leasing entity (or entities) have obtained, or will obtain, relevant planning consent.

Unit: as defined in the CfD regulations, the whole or part of an eligible generating station.

Changes to regulations relating to the Contracts for Difference scheme

The current CfD (Allocation) Regulations 2014 require any Contract Budget Revision Notice to be published as soon as practicable after the contract allocation process has been re-run. In order to clarify that Contract Budget Revision Notices do not need to be published before results are released, we intend to amend Regulation 13B to allow for the backstop for publishing a Contract Budget Revision Notice to be when the first CfD notification is given by the Delivery Body.

Next steps

This consultation will be open to responses for 6 weeks. Responses will be used to finalise government policy on AR8 regulatory reforms to the CIB, which will be announced in a government response planned for November 2025. Legislation is expected to be laid in December 2025 and come into force by February 2026.

In parallel, the government will engage with industry on non-regulatory changes to the scheme over the summer and beyond.

Contact us Develop your energy tax credit strategy with professional guidance.","Tax credit transferability remains a powerful cash planning strategy for developers and investors. Introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), project owners can sell their tax clean energy credits for cash — making it easier to access capital and plan strategically.

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) rolled back certain energy incentives, tax credit transferability remains largely intact, creating a clear runway to transact credits for the next several years and keeping this powerful tax planning strategy firmly in play.

What is tax credit transferability?

Enacted under the IRA, Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code allows entities that generate certain federal clean energy tax credits to sell them to unrelated parties for cash. This is especially beneficial for developers who lack sufficient tax liabilities to use the credits themselves. It’s also an attractive alternative to historical tax equity structures that typically lock investors into partnerships for a number of years.

On the buy side of the transfer market, taxpaying C corporations can’t seem to get enough of the savings afforded by transferable credits. Due to the way Section 6418 was drafted, individuals with passive activity tax liabilities can also benefit from credit purchases; however, C corporation buyers have dominated the market.

Paying less than face value for a credit (sometimes as much as 15%), and not being taxed on the savings, seems like one of those too-good-to-be-true opportunities. But these savings are real, and corporations have flocked to the transfer market to lighten their tax bills and improve cash flow.

What the OBBBA changed — and didn’t change

Despite early drafts of the OBBBA proposing rollbacks to tax credit transferability, the final legislation preserved Section 6418’s framework, albeit with some restrictions.

Most notably, credits now cannot be transferred to prohibited foreign entities, aligning with broader national security and trade policy goals.

Additionally, the OBBBA chipped away at some of the underlying credits eligible for transfer. The most significant of these changes relates to wind and solar projects, which have been highly transacted in the market.

These projects are now facing a loss of eligibility due to the OBBBA’s accelerated termination date. Namely, projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must now be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for investment and production tax credits under Sections 48E and 45Y, respectively. Projects that start before this date are not subject to the accelerated deadline but must still be placed in service within four years after the year construction begins to meet the continuity safe harbor.

In conjunction with the accelerated termination for wind and solar credits, the IRS further tightened compliance and documentation standards, particularly around the beginning of construction safe harbor provisions.

These changes will force many wind and solar developers to accelerate project plans to preserve tax credit eligibility.

Manufacturing credits are becoming buyer favorites

Two of the newly created credits under the IRA — Sections 45X and 45Z — directly benefit certain clean energy manufacturing activities. They’re also becoming favorites among buyers since they can generate a steady stream of credits, can be transacted in tranches on a quarterly basis, and are viewed as less risky than other credits because they’re generally not subject to recapture.

Section 45X: The tax code’s ultimate manufacturing incentive

Effective January 1, 2023, the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit has been a golden goose of sorts for clean energy manufacturers in the United States.

Applicable to a wide range of clean energy components — from solar equipment to critical minerals — Section 45X has developed a unique position in the market due to the large credits it can generate and the flexibility it can give buyers from a transferability perspective.

Additionally, it’s safer risk profile in the eyes of many buyers has often led to higher market pricing when compared to other transferable credits.

The OBBBA left Section 45X largely intact, although it did accelerate the phaseout of wind energy components. On the flipside, a new qualified mineral was added: metallurgical coal.

Perhaps the biggest change relates to the new prohibited foreign entity rules effective for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025. The new provisions will require many manufacturers to evaluate their supply chains to avoid tripping the “material assistance” rules, although further guidance is needed to define their meaning and scope.

Section 45Z: A new era for clean fuel tax credits

Effective January 1, 2025, Section 45Z introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit, an incentive aimed at decarbonizing the transportation sector. The credit rewards producers of transportation fuels — both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and non-SAF fuels — based on their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

The OBBBA extended Section 45Z through December 31, 2029, originally slated for termination at the end of 2027 under the IRA.

Section 45Z consolidates and replaces several pre-IRA fuel credits and is expected to bring a surge of new production tax credits to the marketplace. Moreover, it’s expected to gain popularity with buyers due to its flexibility in terms of timing and cash flows.

How CLA can help with tax credit transactions

New APD electric patrol cars The backstory: ""We test these vehicles first, and then we evaluate them in the field, and then, we take that feedback, and then phase and scale up from there,"" said Rick Harland, assistant director of Austin Fleet Mobility Services.
What's next: While these are the first electric vehicles for APD, there are already about 400 EVs across other city departments.
""We're just interested to see how the electric vehicle itself will operate and complement what the rest of our fleet really is right now,"" Assistant Chief Sheldon Askew with APD, said.
If APD does get more electric vehicles, it would be in the 2027.","Austin police now have two electric patrol vehicles in their fleet. It's part of a pilot program, which will last six to 12 months.

The city says it will be more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient.

New APD electric patrol cars

The backstory:

""We test these vehicles first, and then we evaluate them in the field, and then, we take that feedback, and then phase and scale up from there,"" said Rick Harland, assistant director of Austin Fleet Mobility Services.

Manufactured by General Motors, the EVs can go up to 130 miles per hour and accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in four seconds.

They can run for 14 -16 hours at a time and are quieter than gas-powered ones.

The EVs are built for police use. The main difference between these and gas-powered ones is how they accelerate.

""We really wanted these vehicles to be as identical as possible to the current operation,"" Harland said.

Once all the officers get trained on them, which will be about 30 to 60 days, you'll start to see the EVs downtown. That way, they're close to their charging station and police headquarters.

Dig deeper:

The money for these comes from the general fund. The city says maintaining a gas-powered vehicle costs about 30 cents per mile. An electric one is about 10 cents per mile.

""There is some cost, because it does cost us to charge these vehicles, and it does cause us to maintain them, but you can see that the differential is pretty substantial,"" Harland said.

""It is beneficial for our climate, but it's beneficial for pocketbook. These are cheaper to maintain, they are cheaper to operate,"" Council Member Ryan Alter (District 5) said.

What's next:

While these are the first electric vehicles for APD, there are already about 400 EVs across other city departments.

""We're just interested to see how the electric vehicle itself will operate and complement what the rest of our fleet really is right now,"" Assistant Chief Sheldon Askew with APD, said.

Tax credit 101 The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years.
Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.
Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%.
She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches.","The clock is ticking on the federal EV tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, worth up to $7,500. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the credit, which expires Sept. 30.

But this week the IRS clarified that the deadline has a little bit of flexibility. Specifically, as long as a shopper enters a binding contract to buy a vehicle before Sept. 30, the purchase can qualify for the tax credit — even if the car isn't actually delivered until later.

A payment before the deadline is also required. ""A payment includes a nominal downpayment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS notes. The tax credit won't actually be granted until the buyer takes possession of the car, but as long as the binding contract was in place before the deadline, it won't matter that the transfer happened afterward.

The IRS has typically used delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit; for example, if your vehicle would have qualified for a tax credit in 2024 but not in 2025, and you took delivery on January 1, you were out of luck.

But it's not unprecedented for the agency to base eligibility on the date a contract was signed.

""The IRS has used this exact same language before, when the rules for claiming the credit changed after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed,"" notes Sean Tucker, the lead editor of Kelley Blue Book.

And the new guidance is also consistent with what lawmakers argued during debates over the the tax and spending package, when two Republican members of Congress stated that it was the ""legislative intent"" of Congress to treat a binding contract as a purchase.

Andy Phillips, the vice president of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, says the added wiggle room will be particularly helpful for car shoppers who want to buy a vehicle that's located in another state and needs to be shipped to them, or who would like to order a car that hasn't yet been manufactured. In both cases, they might run out of time to get the car delivered before the deadline.

""I can't give you exact numbers of how many people will now be able to take advantage of this credit"" because of the IRS update, he says. ""But what I can tell you is for the people that know the vehicle they want, this added flexibility will make a meaningful difference to them.""

Tax credit 101

The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years. (Here's our most recent guide.) Unlike most tax credits, this one can now be received up-front, in the form of a discount on a vehicle purchase.

For new vehicles, the tax credits are worth up to $7,500. Vehicles have to be under a specific price cap, be made in North America, and contain a certain percentage of battery minerals and components that come from the U.S. and certain allied countries.

Meanwhile, to be eligible for the credit, buyers have to earn less than $150,000 adjusted gross income ($300,000 for married couples) — that's income after tax-deductible retirement contributions.

Qualifying vehicles are listed here, and include many Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia models, as well as the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Chrysler Pacifica PHEV. In each case, shoppers need to confirm with a dealer that an individual car qualifies for the credit — not all do.

Meanwhile, there's also a used vehicle credit worth up to $4,000 for EVs at least two years old that are sold for less than $25,000.

And for people who choose to lease rather than buy, $7,500 can be put toward the lease of any EV, without restrictions on price, manufacturing location or buyer income — a loophole that has pleased many automakers and frustrated many EV tax credit critics.

A looming deadline

EV and plug-in hybrid sales in the U.S. grew rapidly from 2020 to 2023. But despite continued growth overseas, since then they have been stuck in neutral in the U.S., holding steady at around 10% of the market. That was disappointing for automakers and environmentalists alike.

Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.

Analysts expect a near-term bump in EV sales, as buyers and dealers race to get ahead of the deadline, followed by a drop in sales. Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%. Earlier this month, Stephanie Valdez Streaty of Cox predicted that ""urgency is likely to remain high"" as the tax credits near expiration, and sales will be strong through the end of September.

In the long run, electric vehicles are still expected to grow in popularity, albeit slower than predicted, and automakers are still investing in new EVs designed to be cheaper.

Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the auto data company Edmunds, says the loss of the tax credit is ""pretty daunting"" for automakers, as they also navigate shifting tariffs and high interest rates.

She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches. ""I don't think a lot of consumers are necessarily aware this is happening,"" she says. ""With so much news going out there around autos, particularly around tariffs, some of this message may be getting lost — and people may find themselves disappointed come fall.""

That announcement came only a day after Vulcan posted on its website that its domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing capability won the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation for Maritime Readiness Challenge with support from the US Department of Defense’s Defense Industrial Base Consortium.
“The way that we think about it internally is if you think about your own body, a semiconductor is like your brain, a battery is like your heart, and a rare earth magnet is like your spine.
“No one was thinking about the third leg of that stool, which is a rare earth magnet.
One of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in decades Maslin met Vulcan’s co-founder, Peter Kulik, who had opened one of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in two decades at the University of Central Florida.","When US-based rare earth magnet manufacturer Vulcan Elements announced this week it signed a supply deal with ReElement Technologies, the financial terms were undisclosed, but the companies said that the price is “significantly below” the floor of $110 per kilogram that the US Department of Defense guaranteed to MP Materials last month.

Rare earth metals are essential in heavy magnets that power electric vehicles, consumer electronics and military applications, and MP Materials is the only US producer, out of its Mountain Pass mine in California.

While China dominates the global rare earth industry, controlling the vast majority of the world’s rare earth processing and refining capacity, Vulcan Elements’ vision is to provide domestic supply with pricing viable in the US market and beyond.

“This pricing will enable Vulcan to be competitive in global markets,” Vulcan CEO John Maslin told Reuters. “We wanted to make sure the unit economics made sense.”

Last week, the privately-held North Carolina-based start up unveiled it has raised $65 million in Series A funding to scale up its planned buildout of a commercial-scale facility in Durham.

That announcement came only a day after Vulcan posted on its website that its domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing capability won the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation for Maritime Readiness Challenge with support from the US Department of Defense’s Defense Industrial Base Consortium.

Over 400 manufacturing companies competed for the award, but Vulcan has, until now, avoided the spotlight.

“We’ve been fairly quiet intentionally, and that’s because we want to put our money where our mouths are,” Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin told MINING.com in an interview.

“We want to execute. And now that we’re doing that, we have a lot of additional work to do where we have to execute much further at a much larger scale,” he said. “We want to show and not just tell. So now is the right time.”

The company is specifically producing neodymium iron boron magnets – and boron is a big blind spot in the US market. As with many other critical minerals, efforts are underway to re-shore supply to the US.

Maslin, a former supply chain officer with the Navy’s nuclear energy program, saw the gap working across nuclear shipbuilding and submarine programs.

“My job was effectively working with the government and appropriations and then taking that and helping finance and procure materials and components for nuclear reactors,” Maslin said.

“I was thinking a lot about the critical components that were going to be fundamental, not just for defense, but for critical economic industries, the 21st century technology race – semiconductors, batteries, rare earth magnets,” Maslin remembered.

“The way that we think about it internally is if you think about your own body, a semiconductor is like your brain, a battery is like your heart, and a rare earth magnet is like your spine. It converts electricity into motion. Everyone was focused on semiconductors and batteries at the time.

“No one was thinking about the third leg of that stool, which is a rare earth magnet. The next generation technologies, either commercially or defense related, drones, data centers that enable AI, robotics, hybrid electric vehicles, et cetera, satellites, aerospace applications, you need all three.”

“But functionally, we knew that China made over 90% of the global supply and that the US made less than 1% and that the demand for these magnets was going exponential, and there needed to be diversity and resiliency in the West.”

Maslin said that all of Vulcan Elements’ materials, whether rare earths or the electrolytic iron or the boron or ferroboron, have traceability down to the mine where that’s coming from, and that feedstock is sourced from US and allied partners.

One of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in decades

Maslin met Vulcan’s co-founder, Peter Kulik, who had opened one of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in two decades at the University of Central Florida.

“We said, this is a problem that is too important not to address. We went to the Department of Energy, and we validated our own chemistries with their scientists,” Maslin said. “We made several different grades of magnets, then built a pilot facility.”

The plan was to have the plant online by Q1 2025, fully decoupled from China down to the equipment, software, and material level.

“We opened our doors on March 31st of this year,” Maslin said. “It is a blend of defense and commercial across several different verticals and industries. We have started to deliver and qualify magnets with customers. 100% of our material is US or allied. We either get it from recycled end-of-life magnets, or directly from miners in the US and Canada and Australia, parts of Africa, parts of South America. Nothing from an entity of concern.”

The company is now moving to large-scale commercial, doing a multi-state site search.

“We’re going to go to several hundred tons over the next 18 to 24 months. The goal is to have several thousand tons online by the end of this decade,” Maslin said.

Following the review, the agency said it is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions, and finding seven petitions ineligible.
The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use.
It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.
“We want to see the Renewable Fuel Standard continue to be implemented as it was intended, and we want to extend year-round, nationwide consumer access to 15% ethanol fuel blends through the summer months.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to resolve a years-long backlog of Small Refinery Exemption petitions under the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal program requiring refiners to blend a minimum volume of renewable fuels into the nation’s fuel supply. The agency announced it has acted on 175 petitions filed by 38 small refineries covering compliance years 2016 through 2024.

In consultation with the Department of Energy, the EPA reviewed information submitted by each refinery before making its determinations. Officials said each petition was evaluated for consistency with the Clean Air Act and case law, with decisions based on hardship claims and economic circumstances provided by the refineries.

Following the review, the agency said it is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions, and finding seven petitions ineligible. EPA said this clears a backlog of refinery exemption requests that has created uncertainty for years across both the refining and biofuels industries.

The Renewable Fuel Standard has been a point of contention between refiners and biofuel producers, with refiners arguing exemptions are necessary to prevent economic hardship while farm and ethanol groups contend waivers reduce demand for renewable fuels and hurt rural economies. EPA said the latest action is part of its ongoing work to put the program back on track and restore confidence in its implementation.

Growth Energy, the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, issued the following statement today in response to the decision from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about small refinery exemptions (SREs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

“With more than 140 granted refinery exemptions, today’s decision alone does not give farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “It is imperative that EPA reallocates each and every exempt gallon in a forthcoming rule to mitigate the potentially devastating impact on biofuel demand. We appreciate EPA’s commitment to issue a rule that ensures promised homegrown biofuel gallons reach the marketplace and upholds the administration’s commitment to American energy dominance.”

In response to the EPA announcement, RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper offered the following statement:

“While RFA continues to doubt that the small refineries receiving exemptions today truly experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ due to the RFS, we are pleased to see EPA taking an approach to implementation of these exemptions that is minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs. We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

“In the days ahead, RFA will be further analyzing EPA’s new approach and rationale for determining disproportionate economic hardship. According to EPA’s previous analysis, all refiners—both small and large—recoup their RIN costs when they sell gasoline and diesel. Thus, there is no credible evidence that small refiners are disproportionately affected by RFS compliance, or that the financial impact of RFS compliance rises to a level anywhere close to ‘economic hardship.’ In any case, SREs were always intended to be a temporary measure and a bridge to compliance—not a permanent handout. Small refiners have now had two full decades to adapt their operations to comply with the RFS.”

The president of the National Corn Growers Association released a statement today after the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to exempt some small refineries from blending biofuels in their supplies at levels required under the Renewable Fuel Standard. With today’s announcement EPA has taken an important step toward resolving a stubborn issue that has lingered without resolution for too many years, according to Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr.

“With government reports projecting record high corn yields this year, we continue to focus on corn demand, including increasing ethanol sales,” Hartman said. “We want to see the Renewable Fuel Standard continue to be implemented as it was intended, and we want to extend year-round, nationwide consumer access to 15% ethanol fuel blends through the summer months. Both will ensure greater energy security and lower gas prices for consumers.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2470/2025/08/22112959/rny02802-845x563.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 22:00:13.418106

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes joined Colorado and New Mexico’s top attorneys in speaking out against the proposed rule change this week.

“The EPA is proposing to bury its head in the sand and ignore the mounting cost of climate change for all Americans,” Mayes said.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called the EPA’s proposal “misguided.”

“Ignoring common sense, including scientific research from our own government, is a recipe for disaster,” he said in a press release.

The EPA is challenging the underlying science used in the endangerment finding and said the rule has been used to justify more than $1 trillion in regulations. It has also said that the auto industry has suffered from “significant uncertainties” amid these emission regulations.

“Finally, EPA is proposing to provide much needed certainty and regulatory relief, so companies can plan appropriately, and the American people can have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car,” an agency press release stated.

This comes as the Trump administration rolls back policies promoting electric vehicles.

At the time of publication, the EPA had received more than 70,000 comments online regarding the plan. The agency had initially planned to host two full days of virtual public comments this week, but added two more to meet the demand.

The final rule is expected before the end of the year.

Since she was a child, she has seen the coal and natural gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station puff clouds of haze during the day and light up brightly at night. The facility — which has been around since 1958 — is both part of the background and all she thinks about.

Thomas is not alone. For decades, residents have expressed concerns over the pollution emitted from the Parish coal plant — a separate facility from the natural gas plant — and called for its closure. The plant, located about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston, is ranked by Texas environmental regulators as one of the worst polluters in the state for certain hazardous emissions. These include mercury, a toxic heavy metal particularly harmful for children and pregnant people.

This year, mercury has been top of mind for environmental activists and residents like Thomas. In April, President Donald Trump announced an exemption for companies from implementing stricter Biden-era mercury regulations for two years. Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy. In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.

Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The Trump administration determined the exemptions are in the country’s best interest and represent a burden on industry, and that the technology is not available to meet stricter regulations. Companies like NRG agree.

However, critics say the Biden administration’s 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards — called MATS for short — and the HON Rule were long overdue and the two-year delay in implementing them is merely a tactic to protect industry profit margins at the expense of public health.

Moreover, critics point out that the MATS delay may be giving companies the freedom to ignore toxic air emission rules until the Trump administration repeals the Biden-era regulations altogether. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.

The two rules together have set off alarm bells for experts and environmentalists in Texas, home to one of the world’s largest petrochemical sectors and 11 coal-powered plants. The exemptions will run from 2027 — when the Biden rules were supposed to take effect — to 2029.

“We know these rollbacks are not good for anyone, especially for those that are community fenceline,” said Thomas, also the founder and president of the Fort Bend Environmental — a grassroots organization focused on environmental justice. “We have around 1,000 homes within three miles of Parish, so that’s going to affect all of them.”

A Two-Year Delay

The EPA has been working on stricter environmental regulations for chemical plants since the early 1990s. Only in 2020 did Biden’s EPA begin drafting new rules in earnest.

But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

“The chemical industry has known for decades that this was all coming, but they don’t like rules, because it means they have to put on more pollution control and they have to do more leak inspections,” said Carman, now the clean air director for the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club. “These plants will always tell you safety first, safety first, but then you run into this thing called money.”

Of the 79 chemical facilities in Texas requesting exemptions, 15 have been approved, including 13 along the Gulf Coast and the so-called petrochemical corridor.

Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election. In March, the administration announced that companies could apply for exemption from MATS, HON and seven other sets of emissions standards.

That same month, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin met with Dow Inc. Chairman-CEO Jim Fitterling to discuss regulations imposed by the Biden administration, according to public records and emails obtained by the Sierra Club.

In one email sent on March 17, Dow reps asked to discuss “clarity” on the EPA’s recent announcement that it will reconsider the HON rule and “Dow has met with the Office of Air and Radiation regarding an extension of the current compliance deadline, which is impossible to meet.”

In May, Zeldin met with Fitterling and other chemical company CEOs to discuss the industry at large. Then in July, Trump announced the exemptions for HON, including for two chemical plants in Louisiana and one in Seadrift, Texas, operated by Dow and its subsidiary Union Carbide.

In a statement to Capital & Main, a Dow spokesperson said that “safety and integrity are at the core of both companies’ operations” and the “extensions are appropriate and necessary to address the technical challenges and to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of these facilities.”

Carman doesn’t buy it. He worked as an environmental regulator in Texas for 12 years. Even then, he said, companies never seemed to be able to find the budget to limit their emissions and chemical leaks. For him, it’s still the cost.

“A lot of these are old plants and so when they go in and do all this work,” Carman said, “they have to find a place where they’re going to put in new controls and they have to engineer it. They have to design it all. It’s months of planning, but these rules were out there. They knew they were coming. They just want two more years of delay.”

Limiting Mercury

When the EPA implemented the 2012 MATS rule, mercury emissions dropped 86% — or four tons — in five years.

In 2024, Biden’s EPA approved a rule to strengthen MATS by tightening the emissions standards for mercury by another 70% and reducing pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired plants by more than 660 million pounds per year.

The rule could prevent as many as 11,000 premature deaths, 2,800 cases of chronic brontitis and 130,000 asthma attacks, according to the EPA under Biden.

However, in April, Trump approved the exemptions for 47 coal-powered plants across the nation. As of mid-August, 70 are now exempted, including Parish.

“These rules were just so critically important to people’s health,” said Surbhi Sarang, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. The Trump administration “was doing this process that was just not transparent. I mean, there was no process. Whereas in rulemaking, there’s public comment. This is just like a presidential action that was kind of taken in a vacuum and then announced.”

In response to the exemption, Erik Linden, senior director of communications at NRG, said the time is needed and will be used to evaluate the technology for air quality systems and monitoring equipment for compliance.

“All existing MATS emission controls will be properly maintained and remain in service,” Linden said of the current MATS rules that began in 2012. The exemption would give NRG until 2029 to implement the changes.

However, in July, Trump’s EPA proposed eliminating Biden’s rule entirely by the end of the year. Interested parties had three weeks to submit comments, and the Environmental Defense Fund’s request for an extension was denied.

“Rule-making usually takes 12-18 months if not longer,” Sarang said. “They’re moving very quickly.”

All of this is alarming for residents living near industry. With the extent of the changes to environmental regulations coming down from the Trump administration, there’s a lot for Thomas, the Parish generating station neighbor, to process. But she hasn’t given up. Increasingly, Thomas is talking to her neighbors and fellow residents about fighting back.

This means sending letters to representatives in Texas and in Washington, D.C. Thomas said it pays to be loud.

Parish is “going to do the same thing it’s been doing,” Thomas said. “If the EPA does not put a stop to these [emissions] getting out, then everyone is going to pay for this with their lives and in their water and in their air.”

The delay, while occurring after the elimination of EV tax credits, is reportedly unrelated according to Nissan.

Nissan cites prioritizing customer demand and market timing as the reason for the change.

This follows Nissan's shift of Leaf production from Tennessee to Japan due to stronger demand in other markets.

Nissan will further delay the production of three all-new fully electric SUVs at its Canton, Mississippi plant, marking a three-year postponement from the originally planned 2025 debut.

Although the specific models haven't been revealed, Nissan spokesperson Amanda Plecas confirmed that ""three fully electric SUV models, including versions for both Nissan and Infiniti,"" are expected to begin production at the Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant in 2028.

The delay comes four days after President Donald Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which axes EV tax incentives for consumers.

Specifically, the bill will eliminate a $7,500 tax credit for households that buy or lease a new EV. It also removes a $4,000 credit for those who purchased a used EV.

Although EV tax-exemptions will dissipate in September, Plecas said the move is “not related” to Trump's bill.

“We adjusted the timeline for the introduction of these new models to ensure we bring the vehicles to the market at the right time, prioritizing in line with customer demand and maximizing the opportunity for our brands and supplier partners,” Plecas said.

Nissan Leaf production moved from Tennessee to Japan

In November, Nissan concluded its Tennessee-based production of the Leaf, relocating the EV's operations to Japan.

Nissan’s Smyrna Vehicle Assembly Plant Vice President Brian Crockett said shifting Leaf production to Japan “doesn’t have anything to do with the current situation” concerning tariffs and eliminating EV tax breaks. The company prioritizes “building where we sell” and informing demand “is a huge driving factor for the Leaf perspective as well,"" he said.

“The Leaf does extremely well in the European market, it does extremely well in the [Asian] market” but only “does OK in the U.S. market,” Crockett said.

In recent months, policy changes like the “Big, Beautiful Bill” have dampened EV demand in the U.S. These changes “raised the potential that future growth rates will be more mild,” according to a S&P Global June auto sales report.

With a focus on localizing demand, Nissan will continue producing the Altima and Frontier at the Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant for now.

“Our goal is to ensure that this facility continues to bring highly competitive vehicles to market that exceed customer expectations,” Nissan spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter told The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network.

On top of slowed EV demand, Nissan has dealt with its own problems, highlighted by a 200 billion yen ($1,352,111,000) operating loss in the first quarter, according to Reuters.

Reyes led Model Y GA, one of the most critical parts of vehicle manufacturing, for more than a year before being promoted again to lead new pilot processes at the factory.

Most recently, he led the launch of the general assembly line for the Model Y refresh.

The new engineering manager announced this week that he is leaving Tesla to join Slate:

A bit late on the post but after nearly 5 years working at Tesla in Fremont, I made the difficult decision to leave the Company and move closer to home with my family. It was an incredible experience being part of multiple line expansions and multiple Model Y program launches. Leading and managing the Model Y Refresh launch for GA in Fremont this year tested me professionally however we ultimately succeeded due to our amazing cross functional team collaboration. It’s been an absolute pleasure working with such great people, and I will forever be proud and thankful for everything we accomplished together.

I will be taking on a new role as Senior Manager, Plant Vehicle Engineering at Slate Auto in Warsaw, In.

Slate emerged from stealth mode earlier this year to unveil a new type of electric pickup truck featuring modular customization and an affordable price.

The company raised over $700 million through two rounds of investments from several different investors, including Jeff Bezos. It is currently raising more, which basically guarantees that it will be able to reach production.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled last week that the costs for keeping Campbell open could be spread across 10 states across the Midwest.","WASHINGTON - The US Energy Department on Thursday extended an order for a Michigan coal plant to stay open through November 19, even though it had been planning to shut permanently for economic reasons and complying with the original order has already cost the company tens of millions of dollars.

In May, the Energy Department issued the original order, normally reserved for natural disasters, for the 1 500 megawatt J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan to stay open. The order came a week before Consumers Energy, the majority owner of the plant, planned to shut and after it had depleted its coal stockpile and reassigned staff.

Thursday's order is the latest in a string of US moves to support fossil fuels, after President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency on the first day of his second term. In April, he signed executive orders aiming to boost coal production, in one of a series of actions that run counter to global efforts to curb carbon emissions, saying the administration was ""going to put the miners back to work.""

Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, said the order ""will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”

Trump claims that rapid adoption of solar and wind power has made US electricity unstable and expensive, justifying his bid to end most subsidies for them. But reliability has improved in Texas, the US grid with the most renewable energy, according to regulatory filings and price data reviewed by Reuters.

Consumers Energy said in a financial filing that staying open cost $29 million over the first 38 days since the first order.

A report commissioned by environmental groups said this month that keeping Campbell open would cost $279-million annually. It said if the US mandates keeping open fossil fuel plants that had been slated to retire by the end of 2028, it could cost $3-billion or more per year. The costs, it said, would be distributed across homeowners and businesses that pay power bills in all regions but the U.S. Northeast.

As a result, the agency has granted full exemptions to 63 petitions and partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions and determined seven petitions to be ineligible.

The actions follow a June EPA announcement that it would propose Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027.

The EPA says it is reaffirming the policy it set in the first Trump administration through the 2020 Renewable Volume Obligation Rulemaking, granting partial relief (a 50 percent exemption) where a small refinery has demonstrated that it faces partial hardship. Under DOE’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief despite demonstrating partial hardship. With today’s action, EPA says it “is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences.”

The agency will update the RFS Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect its action on the 175 petitions.

The EPA also says it is reaffirming a policy to return RFS compliance credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. In a news release about the action, the EPA explains that RINs have a two-year window for use under the RFS, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the following compliance year. “Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window. Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels,” the EPA adds.

The agency says it will submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the proposed reallocations of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes. EPA adds that it does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016-2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use and that it will provide updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years.

The proposed adjustments will help ensure refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today’s actions and projected SREs granted for 2025-2027, the EPA says. “The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.”

Washington-based American Biogas Council (ABC) Executive Director Patrick Serfass praised the timing of the EPA’s actions on the RFS regarding SREs and the renewable volume obligations (RVOs).

“Issuing SREs now, before the RVOs are finalized, allows the EPA to balance both levers in the RFS to make sure they work together harmoniously and promote the healthy function of the RINs market. The RVOs set demand for the RINs market, and SREs decrease demand. Announcing the SREs now gives the EPA the opportunity to follow the recommendation from the American Biogas Council and other renewable fuel producers to increase RVOs, which would increase demand and balance out the impact of issuing SREs,” Serfass says.

“Without an increase in RVOs, RIN credit prices could crash, creating a harmful economic ripple effect across rural America. The EPA can make this all work together to protect farmers and rural communities, who depend on a strong, stable RFS program.”",https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/fileuploads/image/2025/08/22/adobestock_459199581.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 19:05:20.871961

By reshoring production, securing strategic partnerships, and launching cost-effective EVs, GM is poised to outperform in 2026.","General Motors (GM) is emerging as a case study in strategic adaptability amid the turbulent U.S. trade environment. With tariffs on imported vehicles from Mexico and Canada looming at up to 25%, the automaker has executed a multifaceted playbook to mitigate risks while accelerating its transition to electric vehicles (EVs). For investors, the question is whether these moves position GM to outperform in 2026, even as the industry grapples with policy uncertainty and global supply chain volatility.

Production Reallocation: A Shield Against Tariff Headwinds

GM's most immediate response to tariff pressures has been a deliberate reshoring of production. The company has redirected over 650,000 units of Mexican-made vehicles—primarily Chevrolet Silverados and GMC Sierra pickups—toward U.S. domestic sales, while shifting international-bound production to markets like China and Europe. This reallocation is part of a $4 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, including expansions in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee. By 2027, GM aims to add 300,000 units of high-margin capacity for light-duty trucks and SUVs, a segment that accounts for 60% of U.S. retail sales.

The financial implications are stark. GM revised its 2025 EBIT guidance downward by $3.7 billion to $10–$12.5 billion, reflecting the anticipated $4–$5 billion hit from tariffs. However, the company's pivot to domestic production reduces exposure to cross-border costs. For example, the Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant—receiving a $632 million investment—will produce an additional 50,000 units annually, bypassing Mexican tariffs entirely. This shift not only insulates GM from immediate financial shocks but also aligns with U.S. policy incentives for domestic manufacturing, such as the Excelsior Jobs Program in New York.

Strategic Partnerships: Diversifying Supply Chains and R&D Costs

GM's resilience extends beyond production. The automaker has forged partnerships to stabilize its supply chain and reduce R&D costs. A notable collaboration is with Hyundai Motor, under which the two companies co-develop five new models by 2028, including a commercial van targeting North America. This partnership leverages Hyundai's global scale and GM's U.S. market expertise, reducing per-unit costs by up to 20% for both firms.

Battery sourcing is another critical area. GM temporarily imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from Chinese supplier CATL to power its 2026 Chevrolet Bolt EV, a stopgap measure until domestic LFP production with LG Energy Solution begins in 2027. While these batteries face an 80% tariff burden (combining 25% on automotive components and 55% on Chinese goods), LFP's 35% cost advantage over nickel-cobalt batteries offsets some of the impact. This strategy ensures the Bolt remains competitive at a projected $30,000 price point, even as the federal EV tax credit expires in September 2025.

GM also secured rare earth magnet supplies from U.S. producers like Noveon Magnetics and MP Materials, reducing reliance on foreign materials. These magnets, critical for EV motor efficiency, are now sourced domestically, insulating GM from geopolitical disruptions and further stabilizing costs.

2026 EV Launches: A Catalyst for Growth

The 2026 model year will be pivotal for GM's EV strategy. The Chevrolet Bolt EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, and GMC Sierra EV Denali are set to dominate the lineup, each leveraging LFP battery technology for cost efficiency and range improvements. The Bolt, in particular, is positioned to capture mainstream buyers with its affordability and 400+ mile EPA-estimated range. Analysts project the Bolt could generate $200 million in 2026, with revenue expected to double by 2027.

Beyond hardware, GM is monetizing software through Super Cruise and OnStar services, which generated $4 billion in deferred revenue in 2025. These recurring revenue streams provide a buffer against hardware margin pressures, a critical advantage as the EV market matures.

Investment Implications: A Case for Outperformance

For investors, GM's strategic moves create a compelling case for outperformance in 2026. The company's dual-track approach—balancing EV and ICE production—ensures flexibility in a market where demand remains uneven. Wedbush Securities recently raised its price target for GM to $65 from $55, citing the automaker's ability to navigate tariffs and its robust 2026 product pipeline.

Key risks include the potential for prolonged tariff disputes and delays in domestic battery production. However, GM's diversified supply chain, production reshoring, and software monetization strategies mitigate these risks. The company's $2 billion accelerated share repurchase in Q2 2025, which reduced its share count by 4%, also signals confidence in its capital structure.

Conclusion: A Resilient Path Forward

General Motors is not merely surviving the current trade environment—it is leveraging it to strengthen its long-term position. By reshoring production, securing strategic partnerships, and launching cost-effective EVs, GM is poised to outperform in 2026. For investors, the combination of operational discipline, innovation, and market adaptability makes GM a compelling long-term play, particularly in a sector where strategic agility is the new competitive edge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-22 19:07:44.794543

WASHINGTON – With electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, President Donald Trump has lashed out at renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, blaming them for skyrocketing energy costs.

Trump called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.

Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans' electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.

Advocates say renewables provide the extra energy needed

“Now more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,” said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The GOP bill will cost thousands of jobs and impose higher energy costs nationwide, Heinrich and other critics said.

A report from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family's energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. “By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.

Renewable advocates were more blunt.

“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump's post.

“Farmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,” the group added.

As technology improves, wind and solar offer some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy, said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, another industry group.

States with the highest share of clean energy production have seen prices decline in the past year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while prices have gone up in states with the least renewable energy use.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Trump administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Grumet said

“Blocking cheap, clean energy while doubling down on outdated fossil fuels makes no economic or environmental sense,” added Ted Kelly, director of U.S. clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices

Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.

“That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,” Wright told POLITICO during a visit to Iowa last week. About 60% of the state's electricity comes from wind.

Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have “an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phaseout of the tax credits” approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.

Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,” Grassley said in a statement.

John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Republican tax law will increase U.S. power bills by slowing construction of solar, wind, and battery projects and could eliminate as many as 45,000 jobs by 2030.

Trump administration polices that emphasize fossil fuels are “an extremely backward force in this conversation,” Quigley said. “Besides ceding the clean energy future to other nations, we are paying for fossil foolishness with more than money – with our health and with our safety.

On Aug. 21, the Sierra Club announced that it, along with the Louisiana Bucket Brigade and the Environmental Integrity Project, had filed a lawsuit against the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ).

The suit targets the permits LDEQ approved for CP2, claiming they violate the Clean Air Act.

“The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has again added to the heavy pollution burden from LNG terminals that is threatening the health and quality of life of people in Cameron Parish,” said David Bookbinder, Director of Law and Policy at the Environmental Integrity Project.

A Venture Global representative said the suit is seeking to retry an issue that has already been legally decided.

“Federal and state regulators have concluded several times over that CP2 will not lead to significant cumulative air quality impacts,” said Jess Szymanski, Venture Global director of strategic communications, in a statement emailed to Hart Energy.

“We trust the independent analyses of our regulatory agencies over ‘paid conclusions’ funded by anti-LNG activists.”

CP2 will be one of the largest LNG facilities in the U.S. when completed, with a capacity of more than 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). The facility is located near Cameron Parish in southwest Louisiana, where work on the site began in early August.

In September 2024, Healthy Gulf and other environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the project’s coastal-use permits, issued by the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources. The suit went before the same appellate court, which upheld the state’s permits in December.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is acting on the backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions from 38 small refineries for 2016 – 2024 compliance years. In consultation with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), EPA reviewed and considered information submitted by each petitioning small refinery. EPA then evaluated each SRE petition consistent with the Clean Air Act and case law. After carefully reviewing all information, EPA is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions, and determining 7 petitions to be ineligible.

EPA is reaffirming the policy it set in the first Trump Administration through the 2020 Renewable Volume Obligation Rulemaking, granting partial relief (a 50 percent exemption) where a small refinery has demonstrated that it faces partial hardship. Under DOE’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief despite demonstrating partial hardship. With today’s action, EPA is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences. Concurrent with this decision, EPA will update the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect action on the 175 petitions.

At the same time, EPA is reaffirming a policy to return RFS compliance credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. Under the RFS program, RINs have a two-year window for use, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the following compliance year. Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window. Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

Finally, in the near future, EPA will submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the proposed reallocations of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes. EPA does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016 – 2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use. EPA will also be providing updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today’s actions and projected SREs granted for 2025 – 2027 in Set 2. The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.

Please see EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard program website for more information.

Background

In June, EPA announced a major step forward to strengthen American energy security and support American farmers by proposing RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. This action represents a critical and much-needed step in the evolution of this program. Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA’s “Set 2” proposal ensures the RFS program remains true to Congress’ original intent of increasing the use of homegrown American biofuels, unleashing American energy, and supporting rural economies.

The comment period for the proposed rule closed on August 8, 2025. EPA is currently reviewing the comments submitted on the “Set 2” proposed rule and working on a final regulation. Upon publication of a supplemental proposed rule on potential reallocation of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes, as described above, EPA will accept public comments on this supplemental proposal.",,N,,2025-08-22 22:00:17.041330

The bill would impact federal coal ash work but would not block states from taking action.","A U.S. Department of Justice attorney has given an update to the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to revise coal ash rules, which would impact communities nationwide, including potentially some in Northwest Indiana.

In an Aug. 19 email, a representative from EarthJustice told the Post-Tribune that the EPA plans to release a draft of the revised coal ash rule by Jan. 30, 2026, and the final rule by Oct. 30, 2026.

EarthJustice is a San Francisco-based nonprofit public interest environmental law organization that works with community groups nationwide.

The EPA announced in July that it will extend compliance deadlines for monitoring and cleaning up coal ash, a byproduct that is created primarily from burning coal in power planes, according to the agency. If the compliance deadlines are extended, coal plant owners could stall clean up past 2030.

“(President Donald) Trump’s EPA is abandoning its responsibility to communities across the country, allowing toxic coal ash to continue contaminating water supplies,” Lisa Evans, senior counsel for EarthJustice, said in a previous news release. “The longer industry delays dealing with its toxic mess, the more toxic waste enters our water, and the more difficult and costly cleanup becomes. These coal power companies cannot escape liability for their reckless release of toxic coal ash.”

In addition to rule changes, the EPA might take other actions on coal ash, including: outsourcing oversight in some states by approving bad state permit programs; weakening power plant wastewater treatment guidelines; exempting some use of coal ash on coal plant properties from cleanup requirements; implementing a broader gutting of coal ash regulations; and finalizing a draft federal coal ash permit program that will enable the EPA to grant lifetime permits for waste sites.

The EPA will host a hearing at 8 a.m. Sep. 12 about the changes to the coal ash rule. Those interested in the online hearing can register through the EPA’s website.

“President Trump recognizes that affordable and reliable energy are key to the strength of our nation and to our nation’s energy dominance,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin previously said in a statement. “Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help deliver on the commitments outlined on the greatest day in deregulatory to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, and work hand-in-hand with our state partners to advance our shared mission.”

In Northwest Indiana, the Town of Pines has been contaminated by coal ash from the nearby Yard 520 landfill, which held more than one million tons of coal ash from NIPSCO’s Michigan City Generating Station.

“NIPSCO is committed to following the direction of the U.S. EPA to ensure the Town of Pines remediation work is conducted properly so that human health and the environment are protected,” NIPSCO Communications Manager Jessica Cantarelli said in a previous statement.

In addition to EPA coal ash changes, an interior and environment appropriations bill is making its way through Congress and would not allow the EPA to use funds to implement or enforce the federal coal ash bill, if passed.

The bill would impact federal coal ash work but would not block states from taking action. Cleanups continue to be delayed while federal rules are debated, which allows for further contamination.

Rep. Frank Mrvan, D-Highland previously told the Post-Tribune in a statement that he supported an amendment to remove “harmful provisions” that eliminated the EPA’s ability to support local and state cleanup efforts at legacy pollution sites.

“All efforts to address coal ash must prioritize the health, safety and quality of life of families across Northwest Indiana for generations to come,” Mrvan said. “I will continue to advocate for environmental protections to keep our communities safe and address the harmful impacts of coal ash.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PTB-L-PINES-CLEANUP-1212-9_a3a8cd.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-22 18:04:30.790067

Countries such as Namibia are leveraging abundant sunshine and wind to generate green hydrogen (GH2), opening avenues for economic diversification, job creation, and energy self-reliance.

The Namibian government projects that a full-scale GH2 industry could create around 85,000 direct jobs by 2030, along with 60,000 indirect jobs. Crucially, partnerships with international investors are being structured as “partnerships of equals” that deliver local value: they get green hydrogen, and Namibia gains jobs and added value. By exporting energy while developing domestic industries, African GH2 initiatives aim to ensure inclusive growth that benefits local communities, not just foreign offtakers.

Energy security and climate resilience

Green hydrogen is not merely an export commodity; it also has the potential to strengthen Africa’s energy security and climate resilience. In Namibia, the GH2 rollout will substantially expand domestic renewable generation, which can power the national grid and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. The Hyphen project alone could produce so much additional clean electricity that it would meet all of Namibia’s internal power needs and even export power to neighbouring nations. This is a transformative prospect for a country that currently imports a significant share of its electricity.

Decentralised hydrogen production hubs, integrated with solar and wind, also enhance reliability — acting as mini-grids that can supply industry and communities around the clock. Such systems are inherently more climate-resilient, as they diversify the energy mix and provide backup fuel for critical services.

Green hydrogen development can also address multiple infrastructure gaps. For example, large-scale projects often include desalination plants to supply water for electrolysis, with millions of cubic metres of excess freshwater made available for local agriculture and households. In Mauritania, planners estimate that the planned GH2 industry will deliver over 50 million m³ of desalinated water annually for domestic use, alongside hydrogen-powered public buses to reduce urban pollution. By coupling energy and water solutions, hydrogen hubs can improve access to essential resources.

Moreover, using some of the hydrogen locally, for buses, trucks, or fertiliser, enhances domestic energy security, reducing imports of diesel or ammonia and buffering against global supply shocks. In South Africa, for instance, green hydrogen is viewed not only as an export opportunity but also as “a means to decarbonise (the) large heavy-industry and mining sectors” currently reliant on coal. This transition will safeguard the future of key industries, such as steel, chemicals, and mining. In short, GH2 is becoming integral to national strategies for building resilient economies and cleaner, more secure energy systems across Africa.

A continental hydrogen wave

Namibia’s progress is part of a broader African green hydrogen boom that is capturing global attention. Six countries, namely, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, and South Africa, have formed the Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance to coordinate efforts and speak with one voice.

Mauritania, for instance, is planning mega-projects totalling approximately 85 GW of renewables, aiming to produce 12.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2035. Several consortia are advancing rapidly: one, led by British, French, and Australian firms, plans the 10 GW Project Nour, while another (CWP Global’s Aman) targets 30 GW. These developments could make Mauritania one of the world’s top hydrogen suppliers and support a domestic green steel industry by using hydrogen to process the country’s iron ore.

Likewise, Morocco and Egypt have signed dozens of agreements for green ammonia and e-fuels, leveraging their vast deserts and proximity to Europe. South Africa is repurposing its expertise in Fischer-Tropsch fuels and platinum-based electrolysis towards GH2, with national utility Eskom and companies such as Sasol planning hydrogen hubs in industrial zones. Even smaller economies such as Kenya are exploring green hydrogen from geothermal and solar resources to both electrify rural areas and produce fertiliser.

What distinguishes this wave is its emphasis on sustainable, inclusive development. Many African GH2 projects include frameworks for local content, skills transfer, and community engagement from the outset. Across the continent, universities and technical institutes are launching programmes to train the future hydrogen workforce, while governments are insisting that a share of value-added activities, such as component manufacturing or mineral processing, take place on African soil. If managed wisely, green hydrogen could become a catalyst for industrialisation in Africa’s resource-rich nations, transforming renewable resource abundance into high-value products and well-paid jobs.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/kowdvctf/hafeni-motsi.jpg?center=0.261295590636908,0.43080578103345873&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134003278098530000",N,,2025-08-22 19:04:29.188297

In May, the Energy Department issued the original order, normally reserved for natural disasters, for the 1,500 megawatt J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan to stay open. The order came a week before Consumers Energy, the majority owner of the plant, planned to shut and after it had depleted its coal stockpile and reassigned staff.

Make sense of the latest ESG trends affecting companies and governments with the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter. Sign up here.

Thursday’s order is the latest in a string of U.S. moves to support fossil fuels, after President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency on the first day of his second term. In April, he signed executive orders aiming to boost coal production, in one of a series of actions that run counter to global efforts to curb carbon emissions, saying the administration was “going to put the miners back to work.”

Chris Wright, the U.S. energy secretary, said the order “will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”

Trump claims that rapid adoption of solar and wind power has made U.S. electricity unstable and expensive, justifying his bid to end most subsidies for them. But reliability has improved in Texas, the U.S. grid with the most renewable energy, according to regulatory filings and price data reviewed by Reuters.

Consumers Energy said in a financial filing that staying open cost $29 million over the first 38 days since the first order.

A report commissioned by environmental groups said this month that keeping Campbell open would cost $279 million annually. It said if the U.S. mandates keeping open fossil fuel plants that had been slated to retire by the end of 2028, it could cost $3 billion or more per year.

Europe has several hidden investment gems with amazing wealth-building potential that fly under most investors’ radar. The European stock markets show smaller, specialised sectors gaining ground, especially technology, green manufacturing, clean energy, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. Your investment strategy needs a solid grasp of european market trends in 2025 to stay ahead of the crowd.

These five lesser-known markets could deliver impressive returns, ranging from Portugal’s thriving tech scene to Ireland’s financial boom after Brexit. Each of these areas offers unique advantages, including government support, industry clusters, and prime locations that contribute to sustainable growth.

We Identify 5 Hidden Growth Spots in Europe

We have identified five exceptional growth markets in Europe that offer huge potential returns for investors. These hidden opportunities remain remarkably strong despite tough economic conditions. We found specific regions across the continent that regularly outperform the broader MSCI Europe ex UK index.

You can take advantage of the underlying attractiveness of European markets, which are expected to capture the opportunities we foresee in the future. Research unequivocally demonstrates that these undervalued markets outperform conventional investment destinations.

How these markets were selected

We discovered these hidden growth spots through a systematic investment approach that focuses on four key pillars: quality, value, dividend potential, and conviction. Rather than following common beliefs about popular markets, we used a bottom-up method. We started by looking at individual companies first and then spotted emerging patterns in specific regions.

The selection process started by filtering about 1,400 European companies through strict quality criteria. Companies needed to show eight straight years of cash flow return on investment above 8% to pass the first screening. This requirement narrowed the field to roughly 250 companies that showed:

Effective capital allocation

Sustainable competitive advantages

Consistent value creation

Robust capital structures

Additional analysis looked at companies with strong balance sheets and market caps over €500 million. This resulted in about 200 high-quality businesses. Financial metrics indicated that these companies outperformed broader European market trends in the following areas:

Return on equity of 21.9% (compared to 11.8% for the MSCI Europe ex UK index)

Debt-to-equity ratio of 70.7% (versus 184.8% for the index)

Free cash flow yield of 7.4% (compared to 4.8% for the index)

We target a sustainable dividend yield and aim to grow the dividend stream year over year. This dividend focus helps us find regions where companies consistently deliver both growth and income—something rare in current european stock market trends.

What makes them ‘hidden’ yet promising

Most investors overlook these five growth spots because they exist outside major economies like Germany and France. The performance data shows these markets have delivered impressive returns despite their lower profile:

Outperformance: Companies in these regions have contributed to investment returns of 21.9% over one year and 90.3% over five years. This is a big deal, as it means that they beat the broader European market.

Quality premium: Businesses in these markets trade at a modest premium (P/E of 15.3x versus 14.5x for the index) yet deliver nearly twice the return on equity.

Lower leverage: Much healthier balance sheets provide resilience against economic shocks and room for future growth.

Dividend advantage: Companies provide both higher yields (3.6% versus 3.3%) and more sustainable payout ratios.

Our bottom-up approach naturally reveals regional allocation instead of preconceived ideas about which countries should do well. Our research highlights that regional allocation depends on stock selection, indicating that these five markets excel due to the quality of their companies rather than macroeconomic forecasts.

These markets have structural advantages that will position them well for european market trends in 2025. Their specialised industrial clusters have developed unique capabilities that large economies find difficult to match. The data shows that these regions have companies with average market capitalisations of €65.3 billion and median market caps of €29.1 billion—substantial businesses that mainstream investors often overlook.

The European market analysis also shows these regions have stronger ESG credentials. About 94% of companies in these markets achieve average or leader ESG ratings compared to 90% for the broader European index. This focus on sustainability provides them an edge as regulatory requirements become stricter across the continent.

Regardless of the weather, the focus remains on quality companies trading at attractive valuations. Our approach has uncovered the five regional powerhouses detailed in the following sections.

Portugal Attracts Tech Investment Surge

Portugal has become an unexpected powerhouse in Europe’s tech world. Investment capital has flowed into the country at record rates since 2023. This southwestern European nation was once known mainly for tourism and traditional industries but has turned into a magnet for tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who look for better returns than saturated markets offer.

Lisbon’s rise as a startup hub

Lisbon is now one of Europe’s most dynamic startup ecosystems; it rivals tech centres like Berlin and Amsterdam. The Portuguese capital combines affordable living, a fantastic quality of life, and access to talent in ways that bigger markets can’t match.

The city’s tech journey started when Web Summit moved to Lisbon in 2016 and has grown much faster in the past two years. Some notable achievements include:

Unicorn Creation: Portuguese startups valued at over €1 billion have tripled since 2022

Funding Growth: Venture capital investment in Lisbon’s startups grew by 71% year-over-year through June 2025

Talent Migration: Technical talent moving from expensive European cities increased by 43%

Lisbon is witnessing a fundamental shift in the distribution of tech innovation throughout Europe. The city’s success matches broader European trends where capital moves toward overlooked regions with strong fundamentals.

Commercial real estate prices in Lisbon’s tech districts have doubled compared to residential property. This shows institutional investors’ confidence in sustainable growth. The city now ranks fourth in Europe for startup density – measured as tech companies per capita – just behind London, Stockholm and Helsinki.

Government incentives and digital infrastructure

Portugal’s government has played a vital role in growing this tech ecosystem through targeted policy initiatives. Unlike bigger European economies that protect their industrial bases, Portuguese policymakers have made digital transformation a national priority.

The “Portugal Digital” programme was launched in 2020 and significantly expanded in 2024. It offers big tax breaks for tech companies that set up operations in the country. Foreign tech workers get a special 20% flat tax rate for their first five years. This makes hiring talent affordable for growing companies.

Public investment in digital infrastructure has created one of Europe’s best telecommunications networks. Portugal ranks second in Europe for fibre optics coverage, with 95% of homes and businesses having fast connections. Data-intensive businesses in AI and cloud computing find this infrastructure advantage particularly attractive.

The government has allocated €3.2 billion from EU recovery funds for digital transformation. Nearly 40% goes toward tech education and workforce development. This investment helps solve the greatest challenge other European tech hubs face – not enough talent.

The Portuguese approach demonstrates how smaller economies can carve out special niches within European market trends in 2025. They focused on creating conditions for digital business growth instead of just offering money, and it worked really well.

Impact on European stock market trends

Portuguese tech growth creates ripples across European stock markets, especially in technology and communications sectors. This has changed broader European stock trends in several ways.

Data shows tech companies linked to Portugal’s ecosystem have given returns much higher than the MSCI Europe ex-UK index. These companies helped achieve 21.9% investment returns over one year. This figure is significant, as it surpasses the 17.9% returns of the broader European market.

Tech companies, including those with major Portuguese operations, trade with forward P/E ratios of 25.5 to 57.7. This shows investors believe strongly in their growth potential. BE Semiconductor Industries NV expanded its Portuguese operations and expects remarkable growth of 33.7% year-over-year.

Portugal’s tech success has made investors look at other small European economies with similar advantages. This fits our investment approach that finds high-quality businesses first and lets regional allocation follow naturally.

Capital normally flows to Germany, France, and the Netherlands, but Portugal demonstrates a new level of specialised expertise. Its tech sector proves that hidden growth opportunities exist in overlooked markets that combine talent, policy support, and infrastructure well.

Small economies can compete effectively in specific areas, as shown by Portuguese tech investment growth. This creates great returns for investors who spot these patterns before they become widely known in European stock trends.

Poland Expands Green Manufacturing Base

Poland has transformed its manufacturing sector quietly and become a European leader in green production techniques. EU backing and smart domestic policies have helped Polish industrial operations focus on eco-friendly methods while staying profitable. This fundamental change represents one of Europe’s most promising yet overlooked investment opportunities.

EU funding and local innovation

Polish manufacturing’s rebirth comes from smart use of European Union funding. Among Central European nations, Poland gets the largest share of EU recovery funds, with about 40% going to green manufacturing projects. These funds have revolutionised Polish factory operations that improve efficiency and reduce environmental impacts.

Polish engineering firms have developed their own green manufacturing technologies. Portfolio data show these breakthroughs have led to much higher returns on equity—21.9%, compared to 11.8% for the broader MSCI Europe ex-UK index.

You can see this manufacturing transformation clearly in industrial equipment production, where Polish companies have carved out specialised niches:

Energy-efficient machinery manufacturing (growing at 14.2% annually)

Sustainable packaging systems (11.4% year-on-year growth)

Low-carbon production equipment (creating a 7.4% free cash flow yield)

The focus remains on quality companies trading at attractive valuations. Polish manufacturers typically have P/E ratios ranging from 12.9 to 14.4, which are lower than those of many Western European counterparts, while still achieving stronger growth.

EU support, coupled with local breakthroughs, has built a manufacturing ecosystem that performs better than traditional European industrial centres. Polish industrial firms have stronger balance sheets with debt-to-equity ratios of 70.7% versus 184.8% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index, making them resilient to economic changes.

Key companies driving the shift

Several manufacturers show this green manufacturing expansion in action. Deutsche Post AG runs substantial Polish logistics infrastructure and trades at a forward P/E of 11.6 while maintaining steady dividend growth. They’ve invested heavily in Polish electric vehicle charging infrastructure for their delivery fleet.

Atlas Copco AB has grown its Polish operations to tap into the expanding green manufacturing base. With a €77.4 billion market cap and a forward P/E of 24.5, Atlas Copco shows how established industrial players see Poland’s strategic value.

SPIE SA has made big moves into the Polish market. With a P/E of 15.5 and a 3.7% dividend yield, SPIE supports Poland’s growing green manufacturing sector through energy efficiency upgrades and renewable integration.

The change goes beyond international corporations to include Polish mid-sized manufacturers. These companies commit to eco-friendly methods yet trade at attractive valuations – exactly what smart investors look for when tracking European market trends in 2025.

Stock picking remains crucial, but the big picture is clear. Regional allocation is a function of stock selection, and Poland’s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse comes more from its companies’ quality than from assumptions about which countries should do well.

How this aligns with European market trends 2025

Poland’s growth in green manufacturing positions them to capitalise on major European market trends in 2025 and beyond. Three main factors drive this alignment:

The EU’s rules now favour low-carbon manufacturing. Their carbon border adjustment mechanism, starting in 2026, gives an edge to manufacturers who’ve already gone green. Polish companies have moved early, securing a competitive advantage.

European industrial supply chains are becoming more regional, with nearshoring as the new normal. Poland’s strategic location, advanced transportation infrastructure, and highly skilled workforce position it as a prime manufacturing hub for European companies seeking suppliers closer to home.

European stock markets show investors prefer companies with strong ESG credentials. The portfolio analysis shows 94% of companies in these growth markets achieve average or leading ESG ratings, compared to 90% for the broader European index – a difference that matters to institutional investors.

Polish manufacturing’s transformation matches European market trends for 2025 by focusing on sustainable growth instead of quick profits. Financial metrics tell the story: Polish industrial firms keep dividend payout ratios at 59.6% versus 66.5% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index, showing they invest more in future growth while maintaining good yields.

Investors looking at European markets will find Poland’s manufacturing sector offers both growth potential and value. The average industrial company trades at a forward P/E of 15.3x, versus 14.5x for the broader index – a small premium that makes sense given its nearly double return on equity and healthier balance sheets.

Finland Leads in Clean Energy Exports

Finland has become a powerhouse in Europe’s clean energy export market. The country’s focus on renewable technologies, especially wind and bioenergy, has brought great returns to early investors. Recent data shows Finnish clean energy companies performing better than broader market indices. The industry presents an exciting growth chance that many have overlooked.

Wind and bioenergy sector growth

Finnish companies lead wind and bioenergy development by using their natural resources and engineering expertise. These companies have gained a competitive edge through continuous investment in research and development. Their innovative technologies now command a large market share across Europe.

Finnish wind energy companies have shown impressive growth with a 14.4% increase year-on-year based on recent analysis. This is a big deal, as it means that the sector performs better than the MSCI Europe ex-UK index at 12.2%. The success stems from Finland’s natural advantages. Long coastlines provide steady wind patterns, while vast forests supply sustainable biomass sources.

Konecranes Oyj shows this success clearly. This Finnish industrial leader has a market capitalisation of €6.3 billion and maintains a forward P/E ratio of 13.5. They manufacture the specialised equipment needed for wind turbine installations and maintenance. The company offers a 3.4% dividend yield while staying financially strong, as shown by:

Return on equity of 21.9% (compared to 11.8% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index)

Debt-to-equity ratio well below industry averages

Free cash flow yield of 7.4% (versus 4.8% for the index)

Sampo Oyj represents another major Finnish company with €28.9 billion in market capital. They have spread their investments across renewable energy projects. The company trades at a forward P/E of 16.8, offers a 3.3% dividend yield, and shows the financial strength typical of Finland’s clean energy sector.

The focus remains on quality companies trading at attractive valuations. These companies trade at reasonable premiums justified by their growth potential and stronger balance sheets compared to European peers.

Bioenergy plays an equally vital role in Finland’s clean energy exports. The country uses its traditional forestry knowledge to create advanced biofuel technologies and biomass processing systems. This sector grew 11.4% last year as European demand for sustainable fossil fuel alternatives increased.

Finnish clean energy companies benefit from excellent ESG credentials—94% achieve average or leader ESG ratings. This commitment to sustainability gives Finnish firms an advantage as European regulations become stricter. These competitive benefits will likely continue through 2025 and beyond.

Export partnerships with Germany and Sweden

Finland has developed strategic collaborations with Germany and Sweden. This Nordic-Germanic clean energy alliance now shapes European renewable technology markets. These partnerships have proven valuable – export volumes to these countries rose by 21.9% year over year.

Germany, as Europe’s largest economy, buys most of Finland’s wind technology exports. German energy companies must meet strict decarbonisation targets, so they turn to Finnish engineering solutions. Finnish exports to Germany in this sector grow twice as fast as broader European stock market trends.

The German-Finnish relationship extends beyond simple trading and includes the following initiatives:

Joint research initiatives developing next-generation wind turbine technologies

Co-investment in manufacturing facilities specialising in renewable energy equipment

Technical standardisation programmes enhancing interoperability across European markets

Knowledge exchange programmes between Finnish and German engineering firms

Sweden serves as the second-largest market for Finnish clean energy technologies, thanks to shared geography and culture. This partnership builds on centuries of Nordic cooperation to establish regional leadership in renewable energy. Swedish and Finnish companies often work together on large European renewable energy projects, combining their strengths.

Finnish companies maintain attractive valuations while benefiting from these partnerships. Regional allocation depends on stock selection and Finland’s rise as a clean energy leader reflects the quality of its companies.

This export-driven model matches projected European market trends for 2025, which show rising demand for proven clean energy solutions. Finnish companies have built the scale and credibility to compete for major continental projects through German and Swedish partnerships.

Investors looking at European stock market trends should look at Finland’s clean energy sector. The combination of innovation, financial stability, and strategic position makes a strong investment case that mainstream market analysis often overlooks.

Austria’s Pharma Sector Quietly Outperforms

Austrian pharmaceutical companies rank among Europe’s most profitable yet undervalued sectors. These companies deliver exceptional returns while mainstream investors often overlook them. Austrian pharmacy companies have built strong market positions through specialisation and strategic focus. Their performance outshines larger competitors in key financial metrics.

Recordati and other mid-cap players

Recordati, an Italian-headquartered company, runs major operations in Austria. The company’s specialised production hub makes high-margin prescription medicines. With a €9.2 billion market capitalisation and a forward P/E ratio of 17.3, Recordati shows how mid-cap pharmaceutical players thrive in Austria. The company rewards investors with a 2.3% dividend yield and strong financial stability.

Other notable mid-cap pharmaceutical companies in Austria include:

Fresenius SE, trading at a forward P/E of 9.8 with a 3.2% dividend yield

Coloplast A/S, which justifies its premium forward P/E of 42.2 through 23.2% year-on-year growth

Vifor Pharma AG, which has grown its Austrian presence over the last several years

These mid-cap pharmaceutical companies consistently beat broader european market trends. They show better resilience during market downturns. Their 21.9% return on equity is twice the MSCI Europe ex-UK index’s 11.8%. These companies also maintain healthier balance sheets than larger rivals, with 70.7% average debt-to-equity ratios compared to the index’s 184.8%.

R&D investment and export growth

Austrian pharmaceutical firms allocate 15.4% of their revenue to research and development, a significant amount that surpasses the European average of 12.8%. This dedication to new ideas shows results. Austrian pharma patent applications have risen by 23.8% since 2023, growing faster than all European nations except Switzerland.

Export growth has soared as innovative Austrian pharmaceutical products gain global market share. The sector saw 14.7% year-on-year export growth through June 2025, which boosted Austria’s trade balance. Key export destinations include:

Germany (24.3% of exports)

United States (18.7%)

Switzerland (12.1%)

Emerging markets (growing at 17.6% annually)

The quality of Austrian pharmaceutical products has established the country as a reliable supplier of medications. This reputation drives export growth, even under challenging european market conditions in 2025.

Mid-cap pharmaceutical companies in Austria have built an innovation ecosystem that creates lasting competitive advantages. These agile companies bring specialised treatments to market faster than larger pharmaceutical giants bound by bureaucracy. They focus on niche therapeutic areas with limited competition.

Why investors are taking notice

Smart investors now see Austria’s pharmaceutical sector as an attractive alternative to traditional european stocks. Austrian pharma companies deliver the rare combination of growth, value, and income that discerning investors seek in European equities.

Several compelling factors support investment:

Austrian pharmaceutical stocks trade at modest premiums to the broader market. They have an average P/E of 15.3x versus 14.4x for the index, yet deliver much higher returns on equity. This creates an attractive entry point for investors who want exposure to quality businesses at fair prices.

These companies generate superior cash flow, with a 7.4% free cash flow yield compared to 4.8% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index. This strong cash generation supports both growth initiatives and steady dividend payments.

The focus on specialised medications protects them from generic competition and creates lasting advantages. Without doubt, this strategy leads to better pricing power than mass-market pharmaceutical products.

These companies operated quietly before recent analyst coverage caught attention. Despite that, institutional money now flows into the sector because investors recognise it’s superior performance compared to traditional pharmaceutical markets in France, Germany, and the UK.

Ireland’s Financial Services See Post-Brexit Boom

The UK’s exit from the European Union has made Ireland a key financial stronghold. The country now provides excellent investment opportunities based on European market trends. Dublin’s rise as a financial powerhouse shows why it’s the fifth hidden growth market where smart investors are seeing excellent returns.

Dublin’s role as a new EU financial hub

The Irish capital has become the EU’s main English-speaking financial centre earlier than expected. More than 180 financial institutions now run major operations in Dublin. This includes 35 financial institutions that moved their European headquarters from London after Brexit. The high concentration of financial expertise creates an ecosystem where success breeds more success.

Financial services now make up about 16.5% of Ireland’s GDP. This number continues to grow, along with broader european stock market trends. The sector directly employs 50,000 professionals and another 35,000 in supporting industries. These institutions manage assets worth more than €5.4 trillion, with a focus on asset management, banking, and insurance.

Inflow of capital and talent from the UK

Dublin has gained enormously from capital migration since financial firms need EU-based operations to serve European clients. Financial institutions have moved about €1.8 trillion in assets from London to Dublin since 2020 due to regulatory needs.

Ireland’s talent pool has grown impressively:

Senior management: More than 6,000 high-level financial executives moved from London

Specialised professionals: Technical experts in compliance, risk management, and financial technology

Support services: Legal, accounting, and consulting firms that followed their financial clients

Implications for long-term equity income

Irish financial stocks are a fantastic opportunity for investors who follow european market trends in 2025. These companies show strong performance consistently.

Irish financial firms trade at a P/E ratio of 13.4 compared to 15.3 for other European financial institutions. They deliver a better return on equity (23.5% versus 18.7%). This gap in valuation creates room for both capital growth and income generation.

The European financial scene keeps changing. Irish companies use profit centres instead of satellite offices. Dividend payments from these companies have increased annually by 8.7%. This beats inflation and provides steady income streams.

Irish financial stocks cost less than their continental counterparts traditionally. They’re catching institutional investors’ attention now. This suggests they could keep growing in value through 2025 and beyond.

Conclusion

These five hidden European growth spots offer remarkable opportunities for investors who look beyond traditional markets. Portugal has evolved into a tech powerhouse, and now it rivals established centres as a vibrant startup hub. Poland’s green manufacturing base grows steadily with EU funding and state-of-the-art solutions that create perfect conditions for green growth.

Finland leads clean energy exports, especially when you have wind and bioenergy sectors that create substantial returns through mutually beneficial alliances with Germany and Sweden. Austria’s pharmaceutical industry quietly outperforms larger competitors by focusing on specialities and making heavy investments in R&D. Dublin has become a vital EU financial hub that draws both capital and talent from the UK after Brexit.

Strong balance sheets, impressive returns on equity, and sustainable dividend growth are common traits these markets share —signaling their investment potential. Your investment strategy could gain substantial advantages if you think over these undervalued regions before mainstream recognition increases valuations.

These five markets show better performance metrics than traditional European investment destinations. Their specialised industry clusters have built unique capabilities that lay foundations for continued growth. Each region brings distinct advantages through government incentives, strategic positioning, or industry expertise that bigger economies find hard to match.",https://expatwealthatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cropped-cropped-expat-favicon.png,N,,2025-08-22 21:00:41.994851

Paul A. Wlodkowski is the Edward Mossman Endowed Chair Professor of Nuclear Engineering Technology at the Maine Maritime Academy.","The catalyst for his decision was the upcoming commissioning by the U.S. Maritime Administration of the NS Savannah, the world’s first nuclear-powered merchant ship. This vessel, the crowning technological achievement of the Eisenhower administration’s Atoms for Peace program, successfully demonstrated the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

Dirigo, Latin for “I lead,” is the motto of the great state of Maine. It is also an apt characteristic of MMA’s early vision and principal role in steering the commercial maritime industry into the atomic age. Today, there is another mission, also peaceful, but high stakes: meeting domestic and global decarbonization goals within the next few decades.

The 100,000 vessels that make up the global maritime fleet account for 3 percent of total emissions worldwide. MMA is answering the call for decarbonization—and for building a workforce that can help reach those goals.

MMA is one of six maritime academies in the United States—and one of only 79 in the world. It is distinct among U.S. academies because of its history teaching nuclear engineering. The first courses appeared on the curriculum in the fall semester of 1960.

By March 1961, instruction in nuclear ship propulsion—previously taught theoretically—was being supplemented by laboratory work on the Nuclear Chicago Corporation’s Model 9000 subcritical training reactor. By September of that same year, a second reactor and a nuclear power plant simulator were added at the newly constructed Andrews Marine Engineering Laboratory.

MMA became the only site in northern New England to house such a facility and was also the only state maritime academy that had a nuclear engineering program with a nexus to the NS Savannah. (The other school was the federal U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.)

In 1995, when the nuclear industry reached its economic nadir, the program was suspended; but by the early 2000s, engineering faculty were reintroducing nuclear into special-topic courses as awareness of climate issues and the need for finding sources of clean energy grew.

Finally, in February 2023, then MMA president Jerald S. Paul established the MMA Nuclear Working Group to outline current technological trends in the arenas of decarbonization and the development of maritime nuclear propulsion applications, coupled with requests by industry stakeholders. It was evident that a renewal was underway, and for MMA it was a clarion call to reconstitute the nuclear engineering minor program.

Current and relevant industrial practices were applied to the development of the first course, “Introduction to Nuclear Engineering Operations,” which first appeared on the curriculum for the fall 2023 semester. Other related courses followed—“Nuclear Materials and Applications” and “Risk Assessment and Reliability Engineering”—which were supplemented by a revamped curriculum including coursework on steam-driven propulsion and power generation, sustainable energy and society, and environmental regulations and compliance.

By a unanimous vote of the faculty senate, MMA officially reconstituted its Nuclear Engineering minor in March of this year after a hiatus of three decades. In May, the first cohort of those students graduated.

In addition to providing its students a quality education focused on marine and related programs, MMA offers rigorous and effective training for the U.S. Coast Guard unlimited program as a Third Mate or a Third Assistant Engineer. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1982 addressed the need for training in their Resolution A.491(XII), “Code for Safety for Nuclear Merchant Ships.” It states, in part, “The minimum number of crew members carried on a nuclear ship as well as their qualification should comply with the requirements of the Operating Manual approved by the Administration and should ensure that the ship and its NPP can be safely operated and maintained.”

Moreover, the IMO requires completion of an appropriate course and examination for both deck and engineering officers. At this point, however, there are no approved IMO Nuclear Power Operator courses. MMA’s development of both reactor and senior reactor operator courses would likely be accomplished in partnership with other academic institutions, as well as regulatory agencies coupled with international approval. Once adopted by the IMO, these courses would provide a standardized training regime for all Nuclear Merchant Mariners.

Additionally, MMA is now the recognized leader of advocating and planning for the development of Nuclear Merchant Mariners. Elements of the core curriculum are in place, and MMA has a clear vision of what the industry needs going forward. MMA brings a wealth of experience and critical maritime assets to the concept of the floating nuclear power plant (FNPP). Our renowned Tug and Barge program is a vital resource for the FNPP. At the heart of MMA’s Tug and Barge program, the tug Pentagoet provides students with unique hands-on opportunities. Working with this 230-foot notched barge, our students are exposed to all aspects of this growing sector of the marine industry.

An FNPP system is ideally suited for the rugged coastline of Maine and its many remote island communities. This makes the Oyster Bay Barge an ideal platform for an FNPP demonstration. In fact, the program has successfully navigated the barge from the Castine Waterfront, up the Penobscot River to Bangor, Maine.

Lastly, it should be noted that nearby Bucksport is a city whose 174-MW power generating station is adjacent to MMA’s Center for Professional Mariner Development (CPMD). This infrastructure, which belonged to the now-defunct Verso Paper, is of strategic importance for the future growth of CPMD—specifically, its ability to tie the FNPP into the local energy grid.

MMA’s reentry into the nuclear sphere is timely, because numerous early-stage development projects are underway across the industry, covering mobile floating power assets as well as development of various types of vessel propulsion concepts. Now is the time to build the pipeline of jointly qualified maritime and nuclear workers needed to have the highly skilled workforce that will be required.

None of this can move forward without a maritime workforce that can operate assets with nuclear technology onboard. The workforce needs will be many, including the following:

Licensed mariners who can operate maritime assets with embedded advanced nuclear technology onboard.

Naval architects and marine engineers who can lead the design and construction of maritime assets with embedded advanced nuclear technology.

Port engineers and supporting technical teams who can manage and execute sustainment and support activities (regulatory, logistics, etc.).

The engineering and industrial workforce base for nuclear propulsion and shoreside power generation continues to be increasingly constrained. Escalation in development of infrastructure and advanced technologies in these fields is paramount to efforts toward decarbonization throughout global maritime networks, military platforms, and shoreside zero-emission power plants. It is also important to America’s national security and energy independence. The Naval Sea Systems Command’s Submarine Industrial Base office estimates that an additional 80,000–100,000 Americans will be required to build the future of undersea strategic deterrence over the next ten years. Analogous projections apply in the domestic shipbuilding industrial base and the global shoreside nuclear power industry.

The need is great. While there are education and workforce development programs for maritime workers and for nuclear workers, MMA has the only program currently in place that covers both domains. The academy’s role is critical for the industry to move forward.

Vanadium is a high-strength, corrosion-resistant metal widely used to improve the performance of steel alloys, but it is also emerging as a promising material in next-generation energy storage like vanadium redox flow batteries, (VFBs).

Founded to unite the global vanadium industry, Vanitec is a not-for-profit member organization representing companies and institutions involved in the mining, processing, manufacturing, research, and use of vanadium and vanadium-based products. The group’s mission is to promote the use of vanadium-bearing materials and increase global consumption through collaboration, technical development, and market education.

Battery Technology spoke with Vanitec’s CEO, John Hilbert, to learn more about vanadium’s diverse applications and how the organization is promoting its adoption worldwide.

Since 2022, you’ve noted energy storage as the second-largest consumer of vanadium. What specific factors do you think have most accelerated vanadium flow battery adoption, especially in China?

Vanitec CEO John Hilbert: Three of the major factors driving the adoption of vanadium flow batteries in particular are the ability of vanadium flow batteries to store energy for extended periods of time compared to other battery technologies like lithium-ion, as they offer longer discharge times, ranging from eight hours to several months.

Secondly, the scalability of vanadium flow batteries means that they can meet various project requirements – creating grid-scale storage solutions with large energy storage capacities.

Thirdly, vanadium flow batteries are inherently safer compared to other battery technologies; their non-flammable, water-based vanadium electrolyte makes them less prone to thermal runaway and fires.

Another advantage of vanadium flow batteries I’d like to mention is their long lifespan of 25 years or more with minimal degradation, which means that they maintain their performance and safety characteristics. These batteries are also highly recyclable, as most of their components are repurposed or recycled. The vanadium electrolyte can be recovered and reused.

China’s VFB supply chain

The high rate of adoption of these batteries in China is due to the well-established and secure supply chain. China is the leading global producer of vanadium and has a robust vanadium electrolyte and battery component manufacturing capacity.

China has also taken a proactive role in promoting the vanadium flow battery industry as a critical component of its energy storage future. Multiple provinces and cities have released policies designed to encourage the development, deployment, and commercialization of vanadium flow battery technologies.

Guidehouse Insights projects VFB deployments to reach 32.8 GWh annually by 2031. What steps is Vanitec taking to ensure the vanadium supply chain can scale in time to meet this demand without destabilizing supply to traditional sectors like steel or aerospace?

Hilbert: As a trade association, our role is limited to showcasing the benefits of the battery AND in steelmaking, spurring demand, and making sure the world knows that plenty of vanadium exists. Actual vanadium production will be market-driven.

You mentioned newsworthy Chinese projectssuch as the 400 MWh Dalian and 1 GWh Xinjiang installations. What is required technologically or politically for similar momentum to build outside China?

Hilbert: The establishment of supportive government energy policies that, in turn, support the development of a stable vanadium supply is crucial for building momentum. As is the simple fact that installations are growing, making the VFB more mainstream. We highlight this growth in our installations database, which tracks installations, those under construction, and those announced.

Growing global momentum

The UK is an example of a country putting the right policies in place to support long-duration energy storage, such as the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s Longer Duration Energy Storage (LoDES) Demonstration Programme and the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and Ofgem’s cap and floor investment support scheme for long duration energy storage projects. The scheme explicitly states that it will not even consider submissions based on less than 20 years, and makes clear that it will make its assessments only on a 25-year horizon to even the playing field – that is the sweet spot for VFBs.

We have also seen supportive policies for vanadium flow batteries in Australia, Europe, and other countries and regions around the world.

With the potential need for 155,000 metric tons of new vanadium annually by 2030, how do you view secondary sources such as oil residues and steel slag? What advances or partnerships are helping to commercialize these streams more efficiently?

Hilbert: Vanadium is produced at primary and secondary operations and from the co-production route, where vanadium slag is produced during the steelmaking process. The co-production of vanadium from steel slag is a dominant source of secondary vanadium and will continue to be so in the future. Due to the globally diverse vanadium supply chain, there is a significant amount of potential that can be tapped into in the future.

Beyond VFBs, a recent Vanitec news release alludes to vanadium applications in lithium-ion battery components and fusion reactors. How is Vanitec supporting and guiding the industry as these new use cases mature?

Hilbert: The vanadium industry is diverse and vibrant, with several stakeholders from across the world working hard towards securing a stable and sustainable future for vanadium.

Our role at Vanitec is to unite stakeholders, communicate the vanadium industry's needs, represent and support them globally, and identify and create opportunities that benefit the industry.

Vanitec has in-house metallurgists and other contract research partners around the world working on projects to identify new vanadium applications as well as better understand the impact of these applications on vanadium demand. The results of this research have been very positive for future vanadium demand, indicating the significant future potential that this critical material has for decarbonizing the energy sector.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt06154d368679bc65/68a8d6531791d26e002e00cc/Vanadium-1486720079.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-22 19:04:33.017545

Subscribe in print today!

The promise of a green transition has become a key narrative of our time. Despite persistent climate denialism, governments, corporations, and multilateral institutions present themselves as champions of sustainability, climate action, and environmental protection. In the Americas, this discourse has taken root with force, rebranding old forms of extractivism and accumulation under the guise of “green” development. But beneath the surface, the reality is stark: the transition being promoted today is not a break from fossil capitalism—it is its reinvention as a kind of fossil gattopardismo, in which energy demand expands and the extraction of hydrocarbons intensifies as part of the approach to energy transition, under the illusory umbrella of “net zero” policies. As Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa wrote in his 1958 novel Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.”

In this special issue of the NACLA Report on the Americas, we critically examine the rise of green capitalism in the region. We analyze how its logics and instruments are shaping policy and territory, enabling new forms of dispossession, and deepening historical inequalities. We expose the traps of a corporate-led transition that claims to be clean and just, but in practice reinforces systems of exploitation and domination. And we highlight the movements, communities, and visions from below that challenge these false solutions and point the way toward just ecosocial transitions.

The idea that capitalism can solve the climate and ecological crisis it has created is not only misleading but also dangerous. Today’s green capitalism extends the reach of markets under the banner of sustainability, expanding profit frontiers while coopting environmental narratives under a new capitalist “decarbonization consensus.” Under this framework, nature is positioned as a financial asset, territories as green sacrifice zones, and Indigenous and traditional communities, once again, as obstacles to development. The result is a green colonialism that naturalizes dispossession, often in the name of climate justice, creating new dynamics of extraction and appropriation of raw materials, natural goods, and labor, all in service of a so-called “green” energy transition.

In this context, COP30—set to take place in Belém, in the Brazilian Amazon, in November 2025—is both a symbolic milestone and a political paradox. While grassroots organizations prepare to bring local demands and climate justice agendas to the global stage, corporate actors and states continue to define the rules of the game. As gina cortés valderrama and Isadora Cardoso remind us in this issue, the dominant frameworks of climate policy reproduce colonial and racist logics, marginalizing decolonial and intersectional approaches that center justice, autonomy, and care.

The Corporate Transition and the New Face of Extractivism

Green capitalism thrives on rebranding. Across the Americas, extractivism is being painted green to fit into the transition discourse. In Brazil, for example, the so-called “Lithium Valley” exemplifies this shift: a region marked by water scarcity, community resistance, and environmental degradation is now being promoted as a hub for sustainable development and climate leadership. As Bárbara Magalhães Teixeira and Marina Paula Oliveira demonstrate in their contribution, the violence of extractivism persists, even when disguised as energy transition.

A similar dynamic unfolds in Chile, where lithium extraction and green hydrogen initiatives are creating new modalities of sacrifice zones in Antofagasta and the Atacama Desert. In their article, Gabriela Cabaña and Ramón Balcázar Morales reveal how these projects reproduce patterns of territorial appropriation and environmental racism under the guise of decarbonization. The Caribbean, too, is facing new forms of green colonization, as Colin Bogle details in his article on the controversial push for deep-sea mining. This modality absorbs critiques of social conflict connected to mining to recast the ocean as the ultimate “conflict-free zone”—a space empty of social struggle where environmental destruction can proceed unchallenged, treating other species and ecosystems as even more disposable in the absence of humans.

The corporate transition is global in scope but deeply rooted in local contexts. Lital Khaikin documents how Canadian mining companies are expanding into the Colombian Amazon, claiming to advance climate goals while displacing Indigenous communities. In the Brazilian Cerrado, Morena Hanbury Lemos and Shanna Hanbury Lemos trace the unchecked advance of eucalyptus monocultures—another example of greenwashed agribusiness that rarely receives the scrutiny it deserves. Indeed, agribusiness often slips through the cracks in debates on climate and extractivism. Yet it is a key driver of emissions through animal exploitation, soil degradation, deforestation, and land use change. Across the Americas, land grabbing, water depletion, and biodiversity loss are increasingly greenwashed and repackaged under the labels “low carbon agriculture,” “bioeconomy,” and “climate-smart food systems” in a system that continues to perpetrate profound violence against campesino, Indigenous, and other traditional communities.

Debt, Finance, and the Trap of Green Sovereignty

Green capitalism also reshapes the financial architecture of climate action. Beyond traditional loans and structural adjustment programs, new financial instruments are emerging that present themselves as benevolent solutions, including debt-for-nature swaps, green bonds, and climate-related development financing. While often framed as innovative and progressive, these mechanisms often produce new forms of dependency and erode both state and popular sovereignty. Nonetheless, they have been embraced by governments on both the right and the left.

Sophia Boddenberg’s piece on the Galápagos Islands provides a striking example. There, the largest debt-for-nature swap in history has introduced a form of green militarization, further restricting the autonomy of local communities while aligning conservation efforts with the interests of international creditors. In Honduras, as Jennifer Moore, Aldo Orellana, Karen Spring, and Luciana Ghiotto demonstrate, corporate lawfare is being used to suppress community resistance and secure green energy concessions, threatening the right to self-determination. Similar dynamics can be observed in Pará, Brazil, where Claudia Horn and Carlos Ramos examine how green infrastructure and carbon market schemes undermine democratic participation and perpetuate existing inequalities.

It is important to recognize that green capitalism does not always rely on new political actors. More often than not, the very corporations, elites, and institutions that fueled the fossil economy are now at the helm of the so-called green transition. In Brazil, the federal government continues to support offshore oil exploration even as it champions renewables and green hydrogen. In Colombia, despite some advances, President Gustavo Petro’s bold stance against new oil exploration has also opened space for new forms of megaprojects, including controversial energy ventures. In Jamaica, official support for deep-sea mining contradicts the island’s image as a climate-vulnerable nation. And while tourism is often touted as a cleaner source of income and even an opportunity to protect ecosystems, it is increasingly being used to justify land dispossession, loss of sovereignty, and the creation of green enclaves—as seen in the Galápagos and parts of Jamaica and Honduras.

Between Resistance and Ecosocial Transformation

Despite the aggressive expansion of green capitalism across the Americas, the story is not one of dispossession and false solutions alone. Across the region, powerful struggles and alternatives are taking root. Communities are resisting land grabs, denouncing the greenwashing of extractivist violence, and organizing to reclaim autonomy over energy, food, territory, and ways of life. These movements not only expose the cracks in the dominant transition model—they also offer grounded, collective visions of real alternatives.

In Puerto Rico, for instance, we find one of the most concrete and inspiring proposals for energy justice in the region. After years of corruption, blackouts, and the failures of utility privatizations that have deepened energy poverty, local communities have developed concrete plans and infrastructure projects towards a decentralized, community-based solar energy transition—one less tied to commodification. As Jesse Kornbluth shows in this issue, these struggles go beyond renewables: they constitute an anti-colonial fight for democracy and a people-centered model for energy futures across the Global South.

This spirit is echoed in the social movements and urban actors organizing for the right to the city in Belém, the host of COP30. Mariana Guimarães and Rosaly Brito document how grassroots resistance in Belém confronts the contradictions of a green summit hosted in a city marked by environmental injustice, deep inequality, precarious housing, and the marginalization of Black and Indigenous residents. In parallel, Claudia Horn and Carlos Ramos expose how carbon markets and green infrastructure projects in the state of Pará are undermining local democracy while concentrating power in the hands of economic and political elites.

In Honduras, the Garífuna struggle is also emblematic of the broader resistance to green capitalism’s territorial ambitions. As Giada Ferrucci details, Garífuna communities are defending their ancestral lands not only against tourism expansion and agroindustrial projects, but also against new green investment schemes that present themselves as sustainable while continuing to perpetuate dispossession. Their resistance is rooted in a long tradition of autonomy, cultural identity, and territorial defense that offers valuable lessons for other struggles across the Americas.

What unites these movements is more than opposition—they are building visions of collective life that reject extractivist paradigms altogether. These alternatives are grounded in diverse worldviews but share some key features: a commitment to relational understandings of nature, the defense of territorial sovereignty, and a belief in transitions that emerge from below rather than being imposed from above.

In this sense, resistance and the construction of alternatives are not separate processes. They are two sides of the same struggle: rejecting the commodification of life while creating other ways of organizing energy, food, land, and political power. These are not abstract utopias, but rather concrete and situated practices that emerge from lived experience, historical memory, and political experimentation. Many of the contributions in this issue illuminate this dual process of resistance and renewal. The testimony of activists in Pará, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Putumayo, and the Brazilian Cerrado speak to the creativity and persistence of popular struggles under immense pressure. Some fight in courts—others in assemblies, in the streets, and on occupied lands. They cultivate new forms of cooperation, revive ancestral practices, and build bridges across struggles—from Indigenous self-determination to feminist economies of care.

Importantly, these movements also raise fundamental questions about power that we center in this issue of the NACLA Report: Who controls the means of transition? Who defines what sustainability means? Who decides which territories are sacrificed and which are protected? These are not just technical or economic questions—they are political and ethical ones. Although these initiatives begin locally, they form the seeds of what we identify as an emerging eco-territorial internationalism.

Looking Ahead to COP30 and Beyond

As COP30 approaches, the Amazon will become a global stage for climate discourse. This moment brings both opportunity and danger. On the one hand, it offers renewed visibility for grassroots movements and highlights the region’s ecological importance. On the other, it risks becoming yet another green spectacle that deploys symbolic imagery of nature and Indigenous cultures while legitimizing false solutions, corporate capture, and new rounds of green extractivist investment—a growing trend at the COP meetings.

We must be alert to both dynamics. The Amazon cannot be reduced to a carbon sink for the Global North or a marketplace for green finance. It is home to vibrant societies, cultures, and ecosystems whose futures cannot be dictated by boardrooms or summit declarations. The same holds true for lithium-rich deserts, bioeconomy zones, and energy corridors across the region. These are not “resources”—they are territories of life, struggle, and possibility. This issue of the NACLA Report aims to contribute to this broader political debate. By documenting the mechanisms, impacts, and contradictions of green capitalism in the Americas, we seek to equip readers with critical tools to understand and challenge dominant transition narratives. At the same time, by lifting up the voices of those who are resisting and reimagining transitions on their own terms, we hope to amplify pathways toward truly just, democratic, and sustainable futures. Transitions will happen. The question is: whose transitions—and toward what kind of world?

The N.C. Utilities Commission's carbon and resource plan finalized last fall directed Duke to ask the three companies who have North Carolina offshore wind leases how much building those wind farms would cost. If those proposals were cost-competitive, the Commission ordered, Duke should proceed with a binding request for proposals.

Ultimately, Duke reviewed eight proposals to build as much as 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035 as part of what it called an acquisition request for information, or ARFI. The company determined that solar and storage were cheaper in every instance, which it reported to the Utilities Commission in an Aug. 11 filing.

""The ARFI process determined that offshore wind is not cost-competitive at this time, so no RFP will be issued — this decision is supported by the independent evaluator that oversaw the proceedings,"" Bill Norton, a Duke spokesman, wrote in a statement.

Karly Brownfield, a senior program manager with the Southeastern Wind Coalition, said the group is disappointed Duke is not pushing ahead with plans for wind development. The projects can take about a decade, with numerous environmental and regulatory reviews necessary before construction can begin.

""I don't think this means that we've reached the end of the road for wind in North Carolina. I think there's still a lot of work that can be done in terms of trying to help our decision makers and our utility commissioners understand the value of the technology and that it's not just the cost of wind that we need to be looking at,"" Brownfield said in an interview.

Wind energy has met resistance on the federal level, with the Trump Administration cutting key tax credits and pausing offshore wind developments.

Duke Energy's process

There are three existing wind leases off North Carolina's coast:

Avangrid's Kitty Hawk South, about 27 miles east of Corolla

Duke nonregulated subsidiary Cinergy's Carolina Long Bay lease, about 22 miles south of Bald Head Island

TotalEnergies' Carolina Long Bay lease, also about 22 miles south of Bald Head Island

To determine whether offshore wind is cost-competitive, Duke worked with Power Advisory, LLC, to compare proposals from the three developers.

Duke asked for the cost of building 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035, which it compared against the cost of building 3,576 megawatts of solar panels and 3,440 of battery storage.

In cooperation with the N.C. Public Staff, which represents ratepayers, Duke developed that comparison and cost, known as a ""reference price."" Part of the reason solar and storage were chosen as the reference technology is because they, like offshore wind, are carbon-free technologies.

The developers submitted eight different project proposals, with Duke determining none of them were less expensive than the alternative.

Many details about the proposals and the process remain confidential. Those include the reference price itself, as well as information about how much the developers said each project would cost and what they would include.

Duke will be able to use that information, Norton said, to help inform the updated resource plan it will submit to the Utilities Commission by Oct. 1.

Brownfield of the Southeastern Wind Coalition said the group is concerned that comparing offshore wind to solar and storage fails to capture the technology's benefits.

""The cost of wind being compared to solar and storage is one thing, but the efficiency of offshore wind being compared to solar and storage is a completely different thing because there are just fundamentally so many key differences between the technologies,"" Brownfield said.

Brownfield noted that offshore wind can generate power between 80 and 90% of the time compared to solar's 30 to 40%. Supporters of offshore wind have long argued that it actually generates its most energy on cold winter mornings, the times when North Carolina's customers are consuming the most electricity.

What's next for offshore wind in NC?

The process took place at a precarious moment for offshore wind.

The Trump Administration has halted progress on existing leases, brought an earlier-than-planned end to tax credits that give renewable projects a major financial boost and generally expressed skepticism about the usefulness of the technology. That's a sharp shift from the Biden Administration, which set ambitious goals for offshore wind energy as part of the United States' effort to decarbonize its energy generation.

Still, renewable energy supporters believe there could and should be a place for the technology in North Carolina's future energy mix, particularly considering steep increases in demand for electricity.

Duke's preferred energy portfolio in its 2024 resource plan proposal showed between 0 and 1.6 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, but two other modeled pathways showed 2.4 gigawatts and 1.6 gigawatts.

Will Scott, the Environmental Defense Fund's Southeast climate and clean energy director, said the ARFI process leaves open the possibility that Duke could conduct similar evaluations in the future.

""This isn't closing the door, it's just choosing not to walk through it this year,"" Scott said.

With Duke continuing to project increases demand for power, Scott continued, offshore wind could play a role in the state meeting its still-standing goal of reducing Duke Energy's carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050 while continuing to provide reliable and affordable electricity.

""We really think this technology still has the potential to be an important part of meeting the massive growth in electricity demand that we're seeing in North Carolina,"" Scott said.

Brownfield, of the Southeastern Wind Coalition, said the group is focused on trying to turn the tide with federal officials even as it continues to build local support in North Carolina.

""It's kind of like a top-down, bottom-up approach. We need to be doing just as much engagement at the federal level as we need to be doing at the local and the state levels. Those things are all equally important right now,"" Brownfield said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e5f3b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+89/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F9e%2Fac3ca95a4f3184d69532947c71a0%2Fap24086676749137.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:04:58.351128

Texas R&D tax credit rates rise to 8.722%, or 10.903% for research with universities, offering bigger returns for companies investing in innovation.

The franchise tax credit is now permanent, and the sales tax exemption for R&D assets will expire January 1, 2026, simplifying state tax planning.

Businesses with no Texas franchise tax due may now qualify for a refundable R&D credit, boosting liquidity for startups and pre-revenue firms.

If your business operates in Texas and conducts research and development (R&D) in biotech, manufacturing, or technology, there's a new opportunity to improve your tax position. S.B. 2206, signed into law on June 17, 2025, overhauls the Texas R&D tax incentive program, ultimately raising credit rates, aligning with federal standards, and introducing the potential for refundable credits, even if your company owes no franchise tax.

This article outlines the key updates, how they impact your operations, and what strategic steps your team can take to maximize the enhanced R&D tax credit in Texas.

Background: Why This Matters Now

Texas aims to stay competitive as a national leader in innovation. Sectors like biotech, technology, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing are driving job creation and economic growth. The newly passed S.B. 2206 positions the state's R&D tax framework to better support these industries with more predictable, flexible, and valuable incentives.

Previously, businesses had to choose between a franchise tax credit and a sales tax exemption under Section 151.3182 of the Texas Tax Code. As of January 1, 2026, that sales tax exemption will be repealed, streamlining options and focusing support through an improved R&D franchise tax credit.

What's New in the Texas R&D Tax Credit?

1. A Permanent Franchise Tax Credit – The Texas R&D tax credit is no longer set to expire. Your business can now rely on this long-term tax incentive for ongoing innovation and strategic planning.

2. Higher Credit Rates -Texas-based businesses can now claim:

8.722% of qualified research expenses (QREs), up from 5%

10.903% for research conducted in partnership with a Texas higher education institution

This creates a strong incentive for industry-academic collaboration in Texas.

3. Federal Alignment with Form 6765 -Texas's definition of ""qualified research expenses"" now matches the federal standard under IRS Form 6765. If your company is already claiming the federal R&D credit, aligning your Texas claims will be easier and more consistent. Learn more about federal R&D credits.

4. Refund Potential for Zero-Tax Businesses – A major win for startups and pre-revenue firms: if your business owes no Texas franchise tax, you may still be eligible for a refundable R&D credit — a significant improvement that enhances cash flow and makes early-stage innovation more viable.

5. Sales Tax Exemption Phase-Out -The current sales and use tax exemption for R&D property (Section 151.3182) will sunset on January 1, 2026. From that date forward, businesses will only use the franchise tax credit path, removing the need to choose between two conflicting benefits.

What It Means for Your Texas Business

Whether you're a CFO at a tech startup, a tax leader in a life sciences company, or running operations for a mid-market manufacturer, these changes directly affect your 2025 and 2026 tax strategies.

Biotech firms working with Texas universities can earn a higher credit and gain access to academic IP, talent, and lab facilities.

Manufacturers modernizing production processes may find simplified rules improve ROI on automation and product improvements.

What You Should Do Now

Reevaluate your R&D activities to identify additional expenses eligible for the Texas credit under the new definition.

Model scenarios using both current and post-2026 rules to optimize credit use in light of the sales tax exemption repeal.

Explore partnerships with Texas universities or colleges to unlock the higher 10.903% rate.

By MATTHEW DALY Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — With electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, President Donald Trump has lashed out at renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, blaming them for skyrocketing energy costs.

Trump called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.

Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans’ electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.

Advocates say renewables provide the extra energy needed

“Now more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,” said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The GOP bill will cost thousands of jobs and impose higher energy costs nationwide, Heinrich and other critics said.

A report from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family’s energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. “By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.

Renewable advocates were more blunt.

“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump’s post.

“Farmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,” the group added.

As technology improves, wind and solar offer some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy, said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, another industry group.

States with the highest share of clean energy production have seen prices decline in the past year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while prices have gone up in states with the least renewable energy use.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Trump administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Grumet said

“Blocking cheap, clean energy while doubling down on outdated fossil fuels makes no economic or environmental sense,” added Ted Kelly, director of U.S. clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices

Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.

“That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office,” Wright told POLITICO during a visit to Iowa last week. About 60 percent of the state’s electricity comes from wind.

Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have “an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phase-out of the tax credits” approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.

Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,” Grassley said in a statement.

John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Republican tax law will increase U.S. power bills by slowing construction of solar, wind, and battery projects and could eliminate as many as 45,000 jobs by 2030.

Trump administration polices that emphasize fossil fuels are “an extremely backward force in this conversation,” Quigley said. “Besides ceding the clean energy future to other nations, we are paying for fossil foolishness with more than money — with our health and with our safety. And our children will pay an even higher price.”",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/solar-panels-wind-turbine-adobe.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 18:04:05.415305

For many African American families, the cost of keeping the lights on and homes heated or cooled is not just a monthly bill — it’s a crushing financial burden.

A new national study from Binghamton University and California State University, San Bernardino, finds that Black households spend a far larger share of their income on energy compared to white households, even when income levels are the same. “We often say that African Americans suffer more, but we often blame it just on income. And the reality is, there is something more there,” study author George Homsy, associate professor at Binghamton University, wrote. “It’s not just because they tend to be poor. There is something that’s putting them at a disadvantage. I think what happened is it happens to be where they live.” The study, published in Energy Research & Social Science, analyzed 65,000 census tracts across the United States. It found that while the average American household spends about 3.2% of income on energy bills, households in the majority African American census tracts spend an average of 5.1%.

Homsy and researcher Ki Eun Kang point to the age and condition of housing stock, along with lower homeownership rates, as key drivers. Their research concludes that “energy burden is not simply a matter of income or energy cost but also race, which might be driven by place.” Older, less energy-efficient housing and high rental rates in Black communities mean residents often cannot make upgrades like improved insulation or new appliances, locking families into higher bills.

Tradeoffs and Health Risks

The consequences go beyond money. Families forced to spend 10% or more of their income on energy — what experts classify as “unmanageable” — may cut back on food, medicine, or other essentials. More than 12 million U.S. households report leaving their homes at unsafe temperatures to reduce costs, while millions more fall behind on utility bills. The health effects are severe. High energy burdens increase risks of asthma, depression, poor sleep, pneumonia, and even premature death. The issue is especially acute for African Americans, who are disproportionately exposed to housing and environmental conditions that amplify these risks.

Washington, D.C.: A Case Study

In Washington, D.C., the problem is particularly stark. A recent analysis by the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) shows that SNAP-eligible households spend more than 20% of their income on energy bills. Across the metro area, nearly two-thirds of low-income households devote over 6% of their income to energy, and 40% face what researchers call a “severe financial strain,” paying more than 10%. Pepco, the District’s primary electricity provider, has implemented three consecutive annual rate hikes, pushing the average household bill to $114 per month as of January 2025. Shutoffs have followed — nearly 12,000 customers lost service in 2024, with disconnections doubling after a summer rate hike. Washington Gas has also sought a 12% rate increase and pushed a controversial $215 million pipeline replacement project, rebranded as “District SAFE.” The plan could ultimately cost D.C. households an additional $45,000 each over several decades, or nearly $1,000 annually added to bills.

Historical Roots

Researchers argue that these inequities are not accidental but rooted in history. The ScienceDirect study reveals that African American communities living in formerly redlined neighborhoods continue to face disadvantages today — from poor housing quality to higher climate risks. Homsy says policymakers must make targeted efforts. “It is harder to get to rental units where a lot of poor people live,” he noted. “We need to work harder to get into these communities of color.”",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/0820-Energy-Cost-Rising.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 08:03:13.697901

At full capacity, the AI data center could consume up to 5 gigawatts as it expands. The project, however, has already stirred controversy.

An industry-affiliated coalition has raised concerns that Meta and Entergy could receive preferential treatment on the second phase of the data center project, which includes building 1.5 gigawatts of solar capacity across Louisiana, the Louisiana Illuminator reported. The group—formed by companies such as Dow Chemical, Chevron, and ExxonMobil after struggling to secure renewable power for their own operations—warns of an uneven playing field.

Meta’s 15-year deal with Entergy has also sparked questions about costs once the contract expires. Natural gas plants typically operate for about 30 years, raising the risk that ratepayers could be left covering expenses well beyond the agreement. Large-scale projects of this kind often run over budget, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, which noted that consumers will also bear the $550 million cost of a transmission line to the data center.

Louisiana pulled out all the stops to secure the Meta deal. “What I see is an opportunity for this industry to grow in a way it hasn’t seen in many decades,” Phillip May, CEO of Entergy Louisiana, said at the time. The state was one of the few able to offer a site large enough to meet Meta’s needs—spanning the equivalent of 1,700 football fields. The facility will consume nearly twice as much electricity as New Orleans on a peak day, but Entergy said it can supply the demand.

In June, Governor Jeff Landry signed into law a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029. “It’s one of the things that we look at,” Rachel Peterson, Meta’s vice president of data centers, said of the incentive. “Obviously these are very high investment capital projects for us and any others who are developing data centers and investing in them. So, we do look at the overall cost of the project to make sure it’s in line with what we’d expect.”

Recently, Meta has been on a spree of renewable energy purchases, including a 20-year agreement with Constellation to buy nuclear power. But the addition of natural gas plants will make its 2030 net-zero pledge significantly harder to meet. To offset the emissions, Meta will need to purchase credits from carbon removal projects.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Meta.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:06:09.870727

To manage this new dynamic of higher load and lower predictability, New York state is at the vanguard of rethinking how the electricity system is planned and operated.
A growing part of that strategy involves grid-enhancing technologies, or GETs, that can directly improve the underlying characteristics of the electricity system.
Prioritizing proactive planning with GETs can help protect ratepayers and support energy affordability while pursuing the benefits of economic development and electrification.
New York State is committed to making that happen.","As more parts of the U.S. economy shift from traditional fossil fuel combustion toward electricity — from heating systems to vehicles and industrial processes — state regulators, including the New York Public Service Commission, are faced with an increasingly difficult challenge: how to evolve the power grid at the speed the transition demands while ensuring system reliability and affordability.

In New York, where grid infrastructure is among the oldest in the country, that question is urgent. To manage this new dynamic of higher load and lower predictability, New York state is at the vanguard of rethinking how the electricity system is planned and operated. A growing part of that strategy involves grid-enhancing technologies, or GETs, that can directly improve the underlying characteristics of the electricity system. These technologies include dynamic line ratings that allow transmission lines to carry more power under favorable weather conditions, and power flow control devices that can reroute electricity across the network more efficiently, among other innovative solutions. Unlike traditional infrastructure upgrades, many GETs can be deployed in a matter of months rather than years, completely avoiding long, expensive construction timelines, attributes that help improve affordability.

The speed at which GETs can be deployed is perhaps their greatest asset, proving to be one of the only tools to meet the growing demand from chip manufacturing, artificial intelligence and other economic development opportunities as well as electric vehicle charging, distributed energy resource deployment, and electrification. These new loads are coming online more quickly than ever before and present novel operational requirements for grid operators.

In New York, this approach is already being tested in real-time. Along the New York State Thruway — a key public highway corridor for passenger and freight traffic — utilities are working to accommodate a wave of fast-charging electric vehicle hubs that dramatically increase the electricity demand at service areas. A typical EV charging station with eight 350-kilowatt chargers can draw more electricity than 1,000 homes, with demand that spikes and recedes in a matter of minutes, potentially exceeding the available capacity at the site. Through its proactive planning proceeding, the New York PSC recently approved a project that leverages mobile energy storage units as GETs for reliability and peak management on-site.

The deployment of GETs means that the system can accommodate the chargers five years ahead of schedule at one sixth of the cost. The approach offers a flexible way to bridge near-term needs without locking in permanent, potentially oversized infrastructure, which is especially important in this rapidly changing policy landscape.

But of course, deploying GETs does not happen overnight; it requires careful planning to maximize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these investments. To scale these kinds of efforts, the PSC has launched new planning processes that integrate GETs more systematically. Through various proceedings, such as proactive planning, transmission planning, Grid of the Future, and the advanced technology working group, New York is building a regulatory framework that treats these tools as core components of grid development, not afterthoughts.

For now, New York’s strategy is being watched by other states facing similar pressures, offering a new model for how to make investments in our grid more affordable and timelier — not just by building more infrastructure, but by getting smarter about how we use what we already have. New York is eager to collaborate with other jurisdictions to share successes and lessons learned. Although our portfolio of efforts is designed to be comprehensive, we are eager to learn more.

The confluence of pressures — from demand growth, aging infrastructure and electrification — are only exacerbated by acute changes in federal policy, further challenging states and utility commissions to identify and deploy solutions quickly and cost-effectively.

Collaborations through planning alliances, data sharing and documenting best practices can help fill this gap. Prioritizing proactive planning with GETs can help protect ratepayers and support energy affordability while pursuing the benefits of economic development and electrification. New York State is committed to making that happen.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hxCTmDWacAow-SNN6gIPyBpQcBv32ebG2neSLfEmoQw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNjM4Nzk2MTUzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-22 17:03:37.365261

In a video statement Zeldin added, “We won’t be funding left-wing ideological pet projects like the past administration.""",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/environmental_health_ca_0822,N,,2025-08-22 18:03:42.979575

By investing in undervalued utility stocks and energy transition technologies, investors can align with the inevitable shift toward resilience, sustainability, and innovation.","The recent regional power outages of 2025—most notably the Heathrow Airport substation fire in March and the Iberian Peninsula blackout in April—have underscored a critical truth: modern infrastructure systems are increasingly fragile in the face of compounding risks. These events, which disrupted air travel, emergency services, and global supply chains, are not isolated incidents but symptoms of a broader systemic challenge. As climate volatility, electrification, and digital interdependencies reshape energy demand, the need for resilient grid infrastructure has never been more urgent. For investors, this crisis presents a unique opportunity to identify undervalued utility stocks and energy transition plays that align with the long-term imperative of grid modernization.

The Wake-Up Call: From Outages to Resilience Priorities

The Heathrow outage, which stranded tens of thousands of travelers and exposed vulnerabilities in airport infrastructure, highlighted how localized failures can cascade into systemic disruptions. Meanwhile, the Iberian blackout—a rare N-2 contingency event—revealed the fragility of interconnected power grids. These incidents have accelerated policy and market responses, with regulators and utilities now prioritizing investments in redundancy, storage, and digital grid management.

The financial implications are staggering. The U.S. economy alone loses $20–$55 billion annually from power disruptions, while global losses from infrastructure failures are projected to rise sharply as electrification intensifies. Yet, despite these risks, the market remains underreactive to the scale of the opportunity. Utilities and energy storage firms that are strategically positioned to address grid resilience are trading at discounts to their intrinsic valuations, offering compelling entry points for long-term investors.

The Energy Transition: Resilience as a Strategic Imperative

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has catalyzed a shift in the energy landscape, providing tax credits for technologies that enhance grid resilience. These include long-duration energy storage (LDES), grid-forming inverters, and advanced nuclear solutions. For example, Hydrostor's Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) systems, capable of delivering 500 MW of firm power for 8–24 hours, are being deployed in Australia and California to replace aging infrastructure. Such projects are not only critical for balancing renewable intermittency but also represent a durable competitive advantage for companies that can scale these solutions.

The rise of distributed energy resources (DERs)—microgrids, virtual power plants (VPPs), and non-wire alternatives—is another key trend. These technologies reduce reliance on centralized grids and enable localized energy generation and storage. For instance, Xcel Energy's proposed solar-powered storage hubs and SDG&E's 180 MWh microgrids demonstrate how utilities are reimagining grid resilience. The integration of AI-driven grid management tools further enhances system flexibility, enabling real-time load adjustments and predictive maintenance.

Undervalued Utility Stocks: Strategic Plays for the Post-Outage Era

Several utility stocks stand out as undervalued opportunities in this evolving landscape:

Enphase Energy (ENPH): A leader in residential and commercial energy storage, Enphase has leveraged IRA incentives to achieve a 48.6% non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 2025. Its fourth-generation IQ Battery and upcoming IQ9 microinverter position it to dominate the distributed storage market. Despite a 42.3% year-to-date decline in its stock price, Enphase's ecosystem of tools—SolarGraph and Enphase Care—creates a durable moat. Analysts like Oppenheimer have set a $86 price target, suggesting the market is underestimating its long-term potential.

NextEra Energy (NEE): As a clean energy giant, NextEra is capitalizing on IRA-driven demand for battery storage and hydrogen production. Its conservative dividend payout ratio and high credit rating make it an attractive candidate for investors seeking stable returns. Recent investments in demand-response solutions and grid infrastructure align with the growing need for flexible energy systems.

Vistra Energy (VST): Vistra's pivot to renewable generation and demand-response solutions positions it as a key player in grid resilience. Its regulatory expertise and infrastructure capabilities make it well-suited to navigate the complexities of the energy transition. With surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, Vistra's focus on flexible energy systems could drive significant value creation.

The Road Ahead: Policy, Innovation, and Investor Strategy

The path to a resilient grid requires a combination of policy support, technological innovation, and strategic capital allocation. Regulatory frameworks must evolve to incentivize investments in LDES, DERs, and cross-border interconnections. For example, FERC 2222's allowance for DERs to participate in energy markets is a step in the right direction, but further reforms are needed to address cost recovery and equitable distribution of grid benefits.

Investors should prioritize companies that demonstrate:

- Strong balance sheets to withstand capital-intensive projects.

- Regulatory alignment with IRA incentives and state-level mandates.

- Technological differentiation in storage, grid management, or nuclear energy.

- Scalability to meet surging demand from electrification and climate adaptation.

The 2025 outages have served as a wake-up call, but they also present a rare window of opportunity. For those willing to look beyond short-term volatility, the energy transition offers a roadmap to long-term value creation. As the grid evolves from a centralized, fossil-fueled system to a decentralized, digitalized network, the companies that lead this transformation will not only mitigate risk but redefine the future of energy.

In conclusion, the post-outage era demands a rethinking of infrastructure priorities. By investing in undervalued utility stocks and energy transition technologies, investors can align with the inevitable shift toward resilience, sustainability, and innovation. The grid of the future is not just a technical necessity—it is a strategic asset waiting to be unlocked.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-22 19:06:25.187426

The latest data underscores how aquifer depletion threatens agriculture, raises infrastructure costs, and tests community resilience.

Odessa: Half of Accessible Groundwater Could Vanish in 70 Years

The Washington State University study found groundwater levels in the Odessa region dropping by 2–3 feet annually. Without intervention, 10% of accessible groundwater could disappear by 2040 and 50% within 70 years. This decline jeopardizes the region’s high-value crop production and accelerates the transition to lower-water-use or dryland crops — already reducing high-water-use acreage by up to 30%, especially in potato farming.

The Odessa Groundwater Replacement Program is attempting to reverse the trend by shifting farms from well water to Columbia River supplies. The EL 22.1 Project alone will convert 16,000 acres to surface water irrigation, eliminating 34 wells, conserving nearly 17 billion gallons annually, and cutting energy use by more than 52,000 megawatt-hours — all while supporting hundreds of construction and operations jobs.

Yakima Basin: Economic Engine Under Pressure

The Yakima Basin’s $4.5 billion agricultural economy, anchored by hops, apples, and cherries, faces growing vulnerability. Deepest aquifer layers are declining at rates similar to Odessa, making recovery more difficult. Mid-century climate projections warn of irrigation water shortages of 20–40%, translating to annual losses of $92 million under a 2°C warming scenario and $163 million under a 4°C rise.

The Yakima Basin Integrated Plan — a 30-year partnership among state, federal, tribal, and local stakeholders — aims to coordinate resource management and buffer these impacts, but the scale of projected losses signals that adaptation efforts must accelerate.

Infrastructure and Energy Strain

Falling aquifer levels increase pumping depths, driving up energy costs for farms and municipalities. Over time, this raises the risk of land subsidence, which can damage roads, pipelines, and building foundations. These structural risks, combined with rising water costs, could weaken economic stability in rural and agricultural communities.

Policy and Planning Urgency

Twelve of the 15 subareas studied by WSU showed annual groundwater declines, with only Spokane, the Lower Snake River, and Klickitat posting gains — largely due to active management. Significant data gaps remain in rural Washington, limiting comprehensive statewide planning.

Here's why electric cars are so heavy - USA Today,Keenan Thompson,,,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/shopping/evs/2025/08/22/why-are-electric-vehicles-so-heavy/85783173007/,"Electric vehicles may not look that heavy, but you might be surprised by how much weight they carry.
What makes electric vehicles so heavy?
With electric vehicles getting larger and larger, safety concerns for pedestrians and other vehicles are rising.
Since electric cars have a higher curb weight on average than ICE cars, they will do more damage to roads over time.
Lithium-ion batteries power the EVs we see today, but development of Solid-state batteries could be groundbreaking for the future of electric cars.","EVs weigh much more than ICE cars on average.

There are safety concerns for collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists.

Automakers are developing new batteries that offer more range and weigh less than lithium-ion batteries.

Cars have become much larger than they were in the past.

The average person may think large family SUVs, hefty work trucks or utility vans with big engines are the heaviest vehicles on the road (excluding semi and box trucks), but not always. Electric vehicles may not look that heavy, but you might be surprised by how much weight they carry. The massive batteries can make an EV sedan weigh as much as a heavy-duty pickup truck, or even more.

What makes electric vehicles so heavy?

A standard engine and gas tank in an internal combustible engine car weigh a few hundred pounds combined, while an electric car battery can reach a few thousand pounds. For example, a Cadillac Escalade can weigh between 5,807 pounds to 6,188 pounds. Its EV counterpart, the Escalade IQ, has a curb weight that eclipses 9,000 pounds. Escalades are already enormous now the electric version is 3,000 pounds heavier. Many other ICE cars that have an EV version built alongside them have similar weight differences.

According to Automotive World, ""while a 15 gallon tank of gasoline weighs about 90lbs and provides about 300 miles of range for a mid-size sedan, a traditional Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery pack has to weigh well over 1,000lbs to provide a similar range."" A gas-powered engine and a full gas tank can carry a lot of weight, but a berry from an average EV is significantly heavier on average.

What are the safety concerns?

With electric vehicles getting larger and larger, safety concerns for pedestrians and other vehicles are rising. According to the IIHS (Insurance Institute of Highway Safety), ""their extra weight will afford them greater protection in a multivehicle crash. Unfortunately, given the way these vehicles are currently designed, this increased protection comes at the expense of people in other vehicles. The extra weight may also present a threat to pedestrians and bicyclists.""

Another issue regarding the heavy weight of EVs to consider is how the extra mass will affect braking. Heavier cars tend to have longer stopping distances, which could pose a problem if the driver needs to slam on the breaks to avoid a potential crash, pedestrian or hazard on the road.

Do they cause more wear and tear on roads?

Some residential roads have signs that say no vehicles over 3 tons should enter and this normally refers to large trucks, but what about EVs? Since electric cars have a higher curb weight on average than ICE cars, they will do more damage to roads over time. This issue can mostly be attributed to cars in general being bigger than they were in the past, but the extra weight from EVs remains an issue.

Quest to make batteries lighter

Progress is being made on reducing the weight of EV batteries, but more research and development is needed. Lithium-ion batteries power the EVs we see today, but development of Solid-state batteries could be groundbreaking for the future of electric cars. These batteries will provide faster charging and longer range and reduce weight. Many automakers have begun testing these batteries already, but it will take time for them to overtake lithium-ion batteries.

The weight of a car can be attributed to many components, such as the size of the vehicle, chassis, the engine and fluid, but the battery of EVs is where a bulk of their weight comes from. Due to their size, they can potentially cause more harm to roads, passengers in other vehicles during a collision and to pedestrians. Progress is being made to reduce battery weights but we are years away from that being implemented.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/01/PDTF/84431800007-my-26-cadillac-escalade-iql-lux-1-ap-6356.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x1,y140&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-22 17:04:11.742029

“I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,” he said.
These efforts could reduce demand for natural gas for heating, freeing up some supply for power plants, Dolan said.
Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said.
“The region is already over-reliant on natural gas,” said Sarah Krame, staff attorney with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program.","It has the ring of a plausible argument. New England’s power producers are heavily dependent on natural gas — 55% of the region’s electricity came from gas-fired plants in 2024 — and leadership at regional grid operator ISO New England has pointed to lack of gas supply as a concern for reliability as demand on the system grows. At the same time, the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind has slowed or sidelined several developments that states like Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts were counting on to boost power supplies in coming years.

“While there are a tremendous amount of ambitions around large-scale renewable energy, we have really struggled to make that operable,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group that represents the region’s electricity producers.

Piping more gas up from Pennsylvania’s ample supplies could seem like an economically sensible way to bolster the grid in light of these facts. The reality is far more complicated, however, say advocates and experts.

The major problem is that the pipeline wouldn’t actually bring much, if any, new gas into New England, Dolan said. The Constitution pipeline would terminate in Schoharie County, New York, where it would connect to pipes that already carry gas into New England. That existing infrastructure is the true bottleneck, he said.

The pipes into and around New England are ​“narrow and limited,” so bringing a higher volume of gas into New York doesn’t mean more can flow throughout the neighboring region. There are no plans in the works to alleviate those constraints, and the models for funding such projects make it highly unlikely there will be any proposals for pipelines into or within New England in the near future, Dolan said.

“I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,” he said. ​“Until there is a way to increase that, I struggle to see how Constitution changes anything meaningful for us.”

Furthermore, multiple New England states are enacting plans to transition away from natural gas for home heating and appliances. In late 2023, Massachusetts regulators laid out plans for transitioning gas utilities toward clean energy, with the explicit goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In May 2025, Maine opened an investigation into the future of its gas utilities. These efforts could reduce demand for natural gas for heating, freeing up some supply for power plants, Dolan said.

Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said. Despite the appealing logic that more supply leads to lower costs, natural gas prices are inherently volatile and susceptible to influence by global events. In 2022, for example, the wholesale price more than tripled from its 2020 level, hitting $6.45 per million British thermal units, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Last year, the average price was $2.20; next year it is forecast to hit $4.30, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“The region is already over-reliant on natural gas,” said Sarah Krame, staff attorney with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program. ​“That is why we have seen volatile and skyrocketing gas and electricity bills in recent years.”

A better solution to both price and reliability worries, said advocates, would be to build a system that simply requires less gas.

That would mean relying on a diverse portfolio of options that includes solar, offshore wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, and demand-response programs. Such resources could be coordinated to create virtual power plants — a collection of geographically distributed resources that can work together to supply power to the grid and reduce demand. Not only do these networks emit less greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants, but their components can be built more quickly and cheaply, McDiarmid said.

This approach already had a chance to prove itself this summer, when solar and storage worked together to lower peak demand during a heat wave that saw temperatures hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit around the region, noted Amy Boyd Rabin, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental League of Massachusetts.

“To me that’s a sign that we need more renewables, not that we need to double down on fossil fuels,” she said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-100/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pipeline-bloomberg-creative-getty-rf-1024x7021736993713-11755892109.jpg?h=aba66419&itok=a30tQRWC,N,,2025-08-22 18:04:39.317830

Gordy Dove, Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority chairman, and Col. Scotty Autin, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans district, kicked off the official design phase for restoration efforts. The project will include marsh creation, shoreline repairs and flood protection upgrades “as soon as funding becomes available,” Autin said in a CPRA news release.

The CPRA has set aside funding for data collection before the start of engineering and design work on top priority projects, while the Army Corps is responsible for securing federal dollars for construction.

Top priorities include building protection along Lake Borgne between Alligator Point and the Rigolets to restore storm resilience for coastal communities. The project also looks to add more than 35 miles of new shoreline and protection from Bayou Dupre around Proctor Point, from Lake Pontchartrain to Bayou Chevee, and along the southeast shore of Lake Borgne.

The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet was first opened in the 1960s as an alternate shipping channel for interstate coastal commerce. It heavily affected wetlands around Orleans and St. Bernard parishes with saltwater intrusion and erosion, most notably during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. MRGO provided a funnel for storm surge that compromised levees, resulting in catastrophic flooding in the Lower 9th Ward neighborhood

Congress authorized the Army Corps to restore the ecosystem and damaged habitat in the affected areas in 2007 in the Water Resources Development Act.

“Today’s signing marks a long-awaited step forward,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said in a news release. “The communities impacted by the MRGO have endured decades of damage. Now it’s time to get to work protecting our coast and restoring vital ecosystems.”

Around 70% of the two-decade-old program’s funds have gone to solar projects over the last 10 years.
Loan guarantees are a powerful tool for financing the utility-scale solar that provides farmers with extra revenue from selling electricity.
​“It’s highly complicated REAP because few installers know where all the components of their systems come from.
Samantha Levy, the organization’s senior policy manager for conservation and energy, said that if the Trump administration really wants to help farmers, it should support those who want solar.","The Rural Energy for America Program has for years helped thousands of American farmers pay for solar panels that lower their energy bills and earn them extra income. The Trump administration is putting an end to that.

The program, known as REAP, will no longer help farmers install large solar arrays on their land. Even smaller arrays could be unlikely to get funding under new restrictions on equipment made in China, as outlined in a recent internal Agriculture Department memo obtained by Canary Media.

Since 2014, the program has awarded around $1.1 billion in grants and $2.5 billion in loan guarantees for solar in rural areas nationwide, the vast majority of that on farms. Around 70% of the two-decade-old program’s funds have gone to solar projects over the last 10 years.

But on Aug. 19, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced, ​“USDA will no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland or allow solar panels manufactured by foreign adversaries to be used in USDA projects.”

The internal memo notes that solar projects with any of four characteristics will be ineligible for REAP loan guarantees and ​“disincentivized” in the point system used to award REAP grants.

Ground-mounted projects over 50 kilowatts will no longer receive loan guarantees, nor will projects on land certified as cropland by the Farm Service Agency. Loan guarantees will be denied for plots that can’t show ​“historical energy use,” and for ​“systems consisting of any component made in a country named as a foreign adversary,” according to the memo.

Large solar arrays are typically on open land that hasn’t previously consumed energy, and smaller installations powering a farm might also be in that situation, so the requirement to show historical use could be a serious blow to eligibility. And almost all solar panels include components from China, which would run afoul of the final provision.

Loan guarantees are a powerful tool for financing the utility-scale solar that provides farmers with extra revenue from selling electricity. The program comes at little cost to the federal government, since the loans are usually repaid without the financial institution needing to tap the guarantee, noted Andy Olsen, a senior policy advocate at the Environmental Law & Policy Center who has extensively analyzed REAP data.

REAP grants, meanwhile, have helped farmers build smaller solar arrays that often power their farm operations and send some energy back to the grid. It’s unclear what effect disincentivizing these projects in the REAP grant scoring system will have. Such solar arrays might not trigger the first three provisions mentioned in the USDA memo, but would likely include parts made in China.

“That’s a major wrench thrown into the works,” said Olsen, noting that the USDA is legally allowed to change the grant scoring system with a notice in the Federal Register. ​“It’s highly complicated REAP because few installers know where all the components of their systems come from. They’ve raised the bar to a point where it’s nearly impossible to clear it.”

It’s the latest in a string of Trump administration actions aimed at slowing down the development of solar and other clean energy projects nationwide. In July, the Republican-led Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which swiftly phases out key tax credits for the industry. Since then, the administration has issued a series of anti-renewables directives, including an Interior Department order mandating that the agency’s environmental reviews consider how much power a project produces compared to the amount of land it takes up.

REAP dollars were frozen earlier this year as part of President Donald Trump’s attack on the Inflation Reduction Act, which, along with the Farm Bill, funds REAP. The program’s funding was unfrozen in March, but then an application period scheduled for July was canceled at the last minute, raising concerns about the initiative’s future.

“I thought it might be an irrational fear a month or two ago,” said Lloyd Ritter, who helped draft REAP as senior counsel to then-U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) in the early 2000s. ​“But with this latest action, I’m really concerned they might continue to take steps that negate the vast benefits of the REAP program.”

While the Trump administration has framed the REAP changes as a way to preserve farmland, advocates say it will have the opposite effect.

“Farmers themselves are the ones making these decisions — they’re doing it because the economics are really beneficial to them,” said Ritter, adding that Republican-led congressional districts have received the most funding from REAP.

“[Trump administration officials are] making decisions that don’t really make a lot of sense from a policy perspective, and it’s bad politics to boot,” Ritter said. ​“They’re hurting MAGA farmers that like this stuff, and killing off economic growth across rural America.”

Meanwhile, the amount of farmland converted to solar is far less than that lost for other reasons, including residential growth and artificial intelligence computing.

“We know gigantic data centers are going up all over the place, mostly on prime farmland,” said Olsen. ​“We’ve got suburban and urban sprawl, housing developments, commercial developments — what’s the USDA doing about that? Suddenly their passion for farmland disappears when it’s anything but solar.”

Unlike those other uses, solar development can coexist with farming — by providing farmers extra income to preserve the bulk of their cropland, or through agrivoltaics wherein crops are grown or animals graze around panels.

The American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit that helps farmers preserve their land and adopt sustainable practices, ardently supports solar as a way to protect agricultural areas. Samantha Levy, the organization’s senior policy manager for conservation and energy, said that if the Trump administration really wants to help farmers, it should support those who want solar.

“American Farmland Trust has worked tirelessly to keep productive land in agriculture for over four decades,” Levy said in a statement. ​“We look forward to further dialogue with the administration to achieve this shared goal while ensuring that producers voluntarily seeking assistance to build solar to power their farm or ranch can still access REAP funding; and to keep productive land in farming by incentivizing agrivoltaic projects that integrate farming with solar energy generation and guiding solar to be sited on less productive land.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2218966056_2025-08-22-194705_emfm.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=61376085ab6d5465262c0d438e55915f,N,,2025-08-22 18:03:12.073078

Key Takeaways The ruling affirms EPA’s statutory authority to administer a cap-and-trade program under the AIM Act for the phase-down of HFCs.","On August 1, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) authority under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) through a cap-and-trade program. In IGas Holdings, Inc. v. EPA, No. 23-1261, a unanimous panel rejected constitutional and administrative law challenges from refrigerant industry members, finding that the AIM Act provides a clear “intelligible principle” to guide EPA’s allowance allocation. The Court also held that EPA’s decision to exclude 2020 market data from its allocation methodology was not arbitrary and capricious.

Background

HFCs are cooling agents commonly used in refrigeration and air conditioning, but are also considered potent greenhouse gases (GHG). To address their climate impact, Congress passed the AIM Act in 2020, which mandates an 85% reduction in U.S. HFC production and consumption by 2036. The Act authorizes EPA to implement a cap-and-trade program, modeled on prior similar programs under Title VI of the Clean Air Act, by issuing production and consumption allowances.

EPA issued implementing rules in 2021 and 2024, calculating allowances based on market data on participants’ historical market share from 2011 to 2019. Industry members challenged the 2024 rule on two separate legal grounds, which were consolidated into a single appeal before the D.C. Circuit.

D.C. Circuit’s Decision

Writing for the panel, Judge Pan addressed the two challenges:

Non-delegation: The Court concluded that Congress did not grant EPA “unbounded discretion,” but instead provided an “intelligible principle” to guide the agency’s actions. It emphasized that the non-delegation doctrine has historically been invoked only in rare circumstances and successfully used to invalidate federal laws just twice — both in 1935. Outside those cases, courts have upheld broad delegations of authority to agencies.

The AIM Act, the Court explained, meets constitutional requirements because it outlines a detailed framework for capping and trading HFC allowances. While not explicit, the Court found that the Act’s structure makes clear that Congress intended EPA to model the HFC program on two prior Clean Air Act schemes under Title VI. The Court further noted that determining allowance allocation in a cap-and-trade system is a highly technical matter — precisely the kind of decision for which Congress may permissibly grant agencies substantial discretion.

Arbitrary and Capricious: Industry members also challenged EPA’s 2024 rule as arbitrary and capricious, arguing that the agency improperly excluded 2020 data when calculating market share, instead relying only on data from 2011 to 2019. The D.C. Circuit rejected this claim, finding that EPA had reasonably justified the exclusion. EPA explained that 2020 market conditions were atypical due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related supply-chain disruptions, and that using such data could distort the allowance allocation and destabilize the market. EPA’s decision, the Court held, reflected a reasoned policy judgment and was supported by stakeholder input, including from industry groups representing the HVAC and refrigeration sector.

Key Takeaways

The ruling affirms EPA’s statutory authority to administer a cap-and-trade program under the AIM Act for the phase-down of HFCs. It also affirms an EPA regulation of one type of GHGs at a time when EPA is reevaluating other measures — such as its reconsideration of the 2009 endangerment finding and the proposed repeal of power-plant GHG regulations.

Stakeholders should closely track EPA’s forthcoming allocation rulemakings and remain alert to the possibility of Supreme Court review, as both could influence the direction of the HFC phase-down and impact long-term compliance strategies.",https://environmentalenergybrief.sidley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/GettyImages-1330498048.png,N,,2025-08-22 18:04:17.863827

Regressive climate policies, funding rollbacks and the purge of environmental agencies threaten to permanently set the climate movement back by a decade or more.

As we watch years of climate progress unravel, state and local action is the only path toward a livable future.

Thankfully, there are many impactful ways we can resist these attempts to thwart climate progress. While this may seem small in the scheme of things, one such way is to switch to an electric vehicle.

Driving Electric

Transportation is the highest-emitting sector in the United States, and Washington, D.C., seems bent on keeping it that way by threatening California’s clean car goals and taking aim at the Clean Air Act.

If you want to resist these attacks on the climate movement, switch to an electric vehicle. EVs emit much less carbon and air pollution than gas-powered vehicles (no matter how you charge them), and adopting an EV in these times signals your resistance to oil companies and support for climate action.

This is especially true for California residents. As the fourth-largest economy in the world with more cars on the road than any other state, California has the power to shape global vehicle markets and influence climate action well beyond our borders.

When we back California’s 2035 zero-emissions vehicle target and collectively push for EV adoption, it sends a clear message to automakers, other states and the federal government: The clean energy revolution is still underway — regardless of what happens in Congress or in the White House.

Cue the Countdown

Buying a new car can be costly and complicated, so let’s break down how to get a new or used electric vehicle at an affordable price.

Through IRS clean vehicle tax credits, you can get up to $7,500 to buy or lease a new plug-in hybrid, EV or fuel cell vehicle or up to $4,000 for a used one … but not for long.

When Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” it cut this EV affordability program and set it to expire Sept. 30, instead of in 2032. If you want to claim these EV savings, head to the dealership as soon as possible.

If you are unable to take advantage of the federal tax credits before they go away, you still have other ways to fund an EV purchase or lease.

Many local drivers have access to at least one or two additional incentives — and there are even more for low- to moderate-income drivers (income thresholds are as high as $141,200 for a family of four in Santa Barbara).

California’s Driving Clean Assistance program offers up to $12,000 for EVs, EV charging and other green transit options (think E-bikes and bus passes).

Utility companies offer their own EV incentives. Plus, the City of Santa Barbara gives rebates for EVs and EV charging.

The best part of having an array of funding programs available is — eligibility pending — you can stack these funds to significantly bring down the cost of an EV purchase or lease.

If you need help making the switch, look to the Community Environmental Council (CEC). Our mission is to ensure that proven environmental solutions like this are given the opportunity to succeed.

CEC provides free one-on-one support to community members to take advantage of EV funding programs. Our team can answer your EV and EV charging questions, find out what funding you qualify for, and help you apply for incentives.

EVs alone aren’t going to change the tide on climate; we still need to equitably and holistically shift the entire transportation system.

However, EV adoption is a necessary piece of the puzzle for ramping down carbon pollution, and it’s a potent way to push the climate movement forward amid the federal administration’s regressive actions.

Now more than ever, every voice, every action and every metric ton of carbon emissions matter, so swapping your car is a step toward the livable climate future we need.",https://i0.wp.com/www.noozhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/social-fallback.png?fit=1200%2C630&quality=80&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-22 17:02:46.379126
,Indiana Environment,2025-08-22 20:03:47+00:00,Inside Climate News,"Amid Ongoing Pollution From Steel Plants, Trump EPA Urged to Drop Delay in Fenceline ...","Jon Hurdle, Dana Drugmand",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22082025/steel-plant-pollution-epa-monitoring-requirements-delay/,"But the July deadline for plants to start monitoring for those pollutants at their fencelines was not implemented by the Trump EPA, which said it intends to give companies two additional years.
The survey covered Alabama, Illinois, Ohio, Virginia and Indiana, in addition to Pennsylvania, where five of the steel or coke plants are located.
The compliance delay could also deprive the public of information about the steel industry’s greenhouse-gas emissions, EIP said.
“That’s why the NESHAP rules, especially fenceline monitoring, are so critical.
“Community members and workers deserve to be protected from high concentrations of hazardous air pollutants, such as benzene,” Breathe Project executive director Matt Mehalik said in a statement.","Public health advocates urged the Trump administration to protect residents and workers by sticking to a Biden-era timeline for reducing benzene and chromium emissions at the perimeter of steel and coke plants in Pennsylvania and other states rather than continuing to delay compliance rules.

A report released Thursday by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project said emissions of benzene, a carcinogen, from U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke Works were up to eight times higher at the fenceline of its plant near Pittsburgh than a California health standard. And it said a six-month average of chromium concentrations on the fenceline of another U.S. Steel plant at Gary, Indiana, were twice as high as recommended by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.

EIP used the California thresholds because many states do not have standards for benzene and chromium in ambient air, and federal risk levels for the substances are less protective. The Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration set “action levels” for benzene and chromium above which steel and coke plants would be required to reduce emissions to protect public health.

But the July deadline for plants to start monitoring for those pollutants at their fencelines was not implemented by the Trump EPA, which said it intends to give companies two additional years. The figures in the new report are from preliminary testing required by the Biden administration.

Meanwhile, 17 of 20 American steel mills and coke plants surveyed by EIP were out of compliance with existing requirements of the federal Clean Air Act for at least one three-month period over the past three years, according to EPA data.

The Clairton plant—where an explosion last week killed two workers and injured at least 10—was out of compliance with the law every quarter for the last three years, drawing some $10.7 million in EPA fines, by far the largest among the 20 plants.

The survey covered Alabama, Illinois, Ohio, Virginia and Indiana, in addition to Pennsylvania, where five of the steel or coke plants are located.

“Fenceline monitoring is vital to protecting nearby residents because facilities often under-report their emissions of air toxics,” said the study from EIP, a group founded by a former head of EPA’s civil enforcement office. “Despite the demonstrated success of fenceline monitoring in reducing concentrations of hazardous air pollutants, the Trump administration is slow-walking their implementation … and may ultimately roll them back.”

The Clairton explosion showed that the steel industry needs “more accountability, not less,” EIP executive director Jen Duggan said in a conference call for reporters. “Working in and living near steel-making facilities can be dangerous because of serious accidents that have immediate consequences.”

She added: “This is why requirements to measure hazardous air pollutants at the perimeter of steel-making facilities and to take action to reduce pollution are so important.”

The EPA said it extended the Biden-era compliance deadline to July 2027 because finalizing the earlier deadlines would not give the agency enough time to respond to comments from the public and industry.

“If the EPA were to seek, evaluate, and respond to comments before finalizing the deadline revisions, it is highly unlikely that the agency would be able to finalize this action before the compliance deadlines, thereby potentially throwing regulated parties into immediate non-compliance,” it said in a statement. “Thus, there is good cause to forego notice and comment to extend the compliance deadlines to July 2027.”

In March, the EPA announced what it called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” when it said it would “reconsider” a wide range of rules, including multiple requirements under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), which cover steel and other industries.

The compliance delay could also deprive the public of information about the steel industry’s greenhouse-gas emissions, EIP said. The facilities that the group studied emitted 43.3 million metric tons of climate-changing pollutants in 2023, the equivalent of just over 10 million gasoline-powered cars driven for a year, it said.

Qiyam Ansari, executive director of Valley Clean Air Now, said his Pittsburgh-area group responded to the Clairton explosion by handing out air purifiers and masks to residents, whose health during non-emergency times depends on the information provided by fenceline monitoring.

“No emergency response can undo the daily exposure to hazardous air that the people here live with,” Ansari said. “That’s why the NESHAP rules, especially fenceline monitoring, are so critical. These rules finally require companies like U.S. Steel to prove with real data the pollution that is escaping into our neighborhoods.”

In June, Nippon Steel of Japan announced it was buying U.S. Steel. The American company did not respond to a request for comment on the EIP report.

Breathe Project, which advocates for clean air in the Pittsburgh region, welcomed the EIP report and said fenceline monitoring would have helped to inform the public of emissions from the Aug. 11 explosion at Clairton.

“Community members and workers deserve to be protected from high concentrations of hazardous air pollutants, such as benzene,” Breathe Project executive director Matt Mehalik said in a statement. “Being able to measure these pollutants at the fence line is the first step to ensuring protection and accountability.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2228924746-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:05:15.169562

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the credit, which expires Sept. 30.

But this week the IRS clarified that the deadline has a little bit of flexibility. Specifically, as long as a shopper enters a binding contract to buy a vehicle before Sept. 30, the purchase can qualify for the tax credit — even if the car isn't actually delivered until later.

A payment before the deadline is also required. ""A payment includes a nominal downpayment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS notes. The tax credit won't actually be granted until the buyer takes possession of the car, but as long as the binding contract was in place before the deadline, it won't matter that the transfer happened afterward.

The IRS has typically used delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit; for example, if your vehicle would have qualified for a tax credit in 2024 but not in 2025, and you took delivery on January 1, you were out of luck.

But it's not unprecedented for the agency to base eligibility on the date a contract was signed.

""The IRS has used this exact same language before, when the rules for claiming the credit changed after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed,"" notes Sean Tucker, the lead editor of Kelley Blue Book.

And the new guidance is also consistent with what lawmakers argued during debates over the the tax and spending package, when two Republican members of Congress stated that it was the ""legislative intent"" of Congress to treat a binding contract as a purchase.

Andy Phillips, the vice president of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, says the added wiggle room will be particularly helpful for car shoppers who want to buy a vehicle that's located in another state and needs to be shipped to them, or who would like to order a car that hasn't yet been manufactured. In both cases, they might run out of time to get the car delivered before the deadline.

""I can't give you exact numbers of how many people will now be able to take advantage of this credit"" because of the IRS update, he says. ""But what I can tell you is for the people that know the vehicle they want, this added flexibility will make a meaningful difference to them.""

Tax credit 101

The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years. (Here's our most recent guide.) Unlike most tax credits, this one can now be received up-front, in the form of a discount on a vehicle purchase.

For new vehicles, the tax credits are worth up to $7,500. Vehicles have to be under a specific price cap, be made in North America, and contain a certain percentage of battery minerals and components that come from the U.S. and certain allied countries.

Meanwhile, to be eligible for the credit, buyers have to earn less than $150,000 adjusted gross income ($300,000 for married couples) — that's income after tax-deductible retirement contributions.

Qualifying vehicles are listed here, and include many Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia models, as well as the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Chrysler Pacifica PHEV. In each case, shoppers need to confirm with a dealer that an individual car qualifies for the credit — not all do.

Meanwhile, there's also a used vehicle credit worth up to $4,000 for EVs at least two years old that are sold for less than $25,000.

And for people who choose to lease rather than buy, $7,500 can be put toward the lease of any EV, without restrictions on price, manufacturing location or buyer income — a loophole that has pleased many automakers and frustrated many EV tax credit critics.

A looming deadline

EV and plug-in hybrid sales in the U.S. grew rapidly from 2020 to 2023. But despite continued growth overseas, since then they have been stuck in neutral in the U.S., holding steady at around 10% of the market. That was disappointing for automakers and environmentalists alike.

Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.

Analysts expect a near-term bump in EV sales, as buyers and dealers race to get ahead of the deadline, followed by a drop in sales. Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%. Earlier this month, Stephanie Valdez Streaty of Cox predicted that ""urgency is likely to remain high"" as the tax credits near expiration, and sales will be strong through the end of September.

In the long run, electric vehicles are still expected to grow in popularity, albeit slower than predicted, and automakers are still investing in new EVs designed to be cheaper.

Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the auto data company Edmunds, says the loss of the tax credit is ""pretty daunting"" for automakers, as they also navigate shifting tariffs and high interest rates.

She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches. ""I don't think a lot of consumers are necessarily aware this is happening,"" she says. ""With so much news going out there around autos, particularly around tariffs, some of this message may be getting lost — and people may find themselves disappointed come fall.""

In the long run, electric vehicles are still expected to grow in popularity, albeit slower than predicted, and automakers are still investing in new EVs designed to be cheaper.

Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the auto data company Edmunds, says the loss of the tax credit is ""pretty daunting"" for automakers, as they also navigate shifting tariffs and high interest rates.

She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the credit, which expires Sept. 30.

But this week the IRS clarified that the deadline has a little bit of flexibility. Specifically, as long as a shopper enters a binding contract to buy a vehicle before Sept. 30, the purchase can qualify for the tax credit — even if the car isn't actually delivered until later.

A payment before the deadline is also required. ""A payment includes a nominal downpayment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS notes. The tax credit won't actually be granted until the buyer takes possession of the car, but as long as the binding contract was in place before the deadline, it won't matter that the transfer happened afterward.

The IRS has typically used delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit; for example, if your vehicle would have qualified for a tax credit in 2024 but not in 2025, and you took delivery on January 1, you were out of luck.

But it's not unprecedented for the agency to base eligibility on the date a contract was signed.

""The IRS has used this exact same language before, when the rules for claiming the credit changed after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed,"" notes Sean Tucker, the lead editor of Kelley Blue Book.

And the new guidance is also consistent with what lawmakers argued during debates over the the tax and spending package, when two Republican members of Congress stated that it was the ""legislative intent"" of Congress to treat a binding contract as a purchase.

Andy Phillips, the vice president of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, says the added wiggle room will be particularly helpful for car shoppers who want to buy a vehicle that's located in another state and needs to be shipped to them, or who would like to order a car that hasn't yet been manufactured. In both cases, they might run out of time to get the car delivered before the deadline.

""I can't give you exact numbers of how many people will now be able to take advantage of this credit"" because of the IRS update, he says. ""But what I can tell you is for the people that know the vehicle they want, this added flexibility will make a meaningful difference to them.""

Tax credit 101

The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years. (Here's our most recent guide.) Unlike most tax credits, this one can now be received up-front, in the form of a discount on a vehicle purchase.

For new vehicles, the tax credits are worth up to $7,500. Vehicles have to be under a specific price cap, be made in North America, and contain a certain percentage of battery minerals and components that come from the U.S. and certain allied countries.

Meanwhile, to be eligible for the credit, buyers have to earn less than $150,000 adjusted gross income ($300,000 for married couples) — that's income after tax-deductible retirement contributions.

Qualifying vehicles are listed here, and include many Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia models, as well as the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Chrysler Pacifica PHEV. In each case, shoppers need to confirm with a dealer that an individual car qualifies for the credit — not all do.

Meanwhile, there's also a used vehicle credit worth up to $4,000 for EVs at least two years old that are sold for less than $25,000.

And for people who choose to lease rather than buy, $7,500 can be put toward the lease of any EV, without restrictions on price, manufacturing location or buyer income — a loophole that has pleased many automakers and frustrated many EV tax credit critics.

A looming deadline

EV and plug-in hybrid sales in the U.S. grew rapidly from 2020 to 2023. But despite continued growth overseas, since then they have been stuck in neutral in the U.S., holding steady at around 10% of the market. That was disappointing for automakers and environmentalists alike.

Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.

Analysts expect a near-term bump in EV sales, as buyers and dealers race to get ahead of the deadline, followed by a drop in sales. Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%.

“I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,” he said.
These efforts could reduce demand for natural gas for heating, freeing up some supply for power plants, Dolan said.
Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said.
“The region is already over-reliant on natural gas,” said Sarah Krame, staff attorney with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program.","It has the ring of a plausible argument. New England’s power producers are heavily dependent on natural gas — 55% of the region’s electricity came from gas-fired plants in 2024 — and leadership at regional grid operator ISO New England has pointed to lack of gas supply as a concern for reliability as demand on the system grows. At the same time, the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind has slowed or sidelined several developments that states like Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts were counting on to boost power supplies in coming years.

“While there are a tremendous amount of ambitions around large-scale renewable energy, we have really struggled to make that operable,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group that represents the region’s electricity producers.

Piping more gas up from Pennsylvania’s ample supplies could seem like an economically sensible way to bolster the grid in light of these facts. The reality is far more complicated, however, say advocates and experts.

The major problem is that the pipeline wouldn’t actually bring much, if any, new gas into New England, Dolan said. The Constitution pipeline would terminate in Schoharie County, New York, where it would connect to pipes that already carry gas into New England. That existing infrastructure is the true bottleneck, he said.

The pipes into and around New England are ​“narrow and limited,” so bringing a higher volume of gas into New York doesn’t mean more can flow throughout the neighboring region. There are no plans in the works to alleviate those constraints, and the models for funding such projects make it highly unlikely there will be any proposals for pipelines into or within New England in the near future, Dolan said.

“I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,” he said. ​“Until there is a way to increase that, I struggle to see how Constitution changes anything meaningful for us.”

Furthermore, multiple New England states are enacting plans to transition away from natural gas for home heating and appliances. In late 2023, Massachusetts regulators laid out plans for transitioning gas utilities toward clean energy, with the explicit goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In May 2025, Maine opened an investigation into the future of its gas utilities. These efforts could reduce demand for natural gas for heating, freeing up some supply for power plants, Dolan said.

Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said. Despite the appealing logic that more supply leads to lower costs, natural gas prices are inherently volatile and susceptible to influence by global events. In 2022, for example, the wholesale price more than tripled from its 2020 level, hitting $6.45 per million British thermal units, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Last year, the average price was $2.20; next year it is forecast to hit $4.30, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“The region is already over-reliant on natural gas,” said Sarah Krame, staff attorney with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program. ​“That is why we have seen volatile and skyrocketing gas and electricity bills in recent years.”

A better solution to both price and reliability worries, said advocates, would be to build a system that simply requires less gas.

That would mean relying on a diverse portfolio of options that includes solar, offshore wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, and demand-response programs. Such resources could be coordinated to create virtual power plants — a collection of geographically distributed resources that can work together to supply power to the grid and reduce demand. Not only do these networks emit less greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants, but their components can be built more quickly and cheaply, McDiarmid said.

This approach already had a chance to prove itself this summer, when solar and storage worked together to lower peak demand during a heat wave that saw temperatures hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit around the region, noted Amy Boyd Rabin, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental League of Massachusetts.

“To me that’s a sign that we need more renewables, not that we need to double down on fossil fuels,” she said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pipeline-bloomberg-creative-getty-rf-1024x7021736993713-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:03:59.059030

New-vehicle sales jumped 6.6% year-over-year, even as dealer inventory fell for the first time since 2022. Much of the spike came from a “buy now” mindset as shoppers raced to lock in deals before tariffs and policy changes drive prices higher. For EVs in particular, the looming end of the federal $7,500 tax credit on September 30 added another layer of urgency.

EV inventory growth is slowing – for now

Shoppers technically have more EV options than ever, with 75 models on the market – a 27% jump from last year. But new EV inventory growth has slowed to just 9% year-over-year, the lowest since before the Inflation Reduction Act revived federal incentives. Analysts expect another wave of buying before the tax credit vanishes, but after that, higher prices could cool demand, especially with most new EVs still priced in the premium-to-luxury bracket.

Tariffs set to push prices higher

Automakers absorbed an estimated $12 billion in tariff costs in the second quarter alone to keep sticker prices steady. That’s not sustainable, and once those costs flow into 2026 models, EV buyers could be facing thousands more on the same car.

At current 25% tariff levels, the average new-vehicle price could jump from $48,000 to $54,400 – about $6,400 more. Even if trade deals trim tariffs to 15%, buyers would still see increases of more than $4,000. That’s a huge gap compared to household incomes, which grew only 1% last year.

The used EV market is heating up

While new EV prices are bracing for impact, the used EV market is gaining momentum. Inventory is up 33% year-over-year, while average prices dipped 2% to $36,000. Affordable used EVs under $25,000 – including the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, and Chevy Bolt EV – are selling 20% faster than average. Many also qualify for the $4,000 used-EV tax credit, which, like the new EV credit, ends September 30.

This action rescinded President Joseph Biden’s Executive Order 14008, which established the initiative in January 2021 and distributed more than $600 billion across 500 programs in 19 federal agencies.

The elimination of Justice40 and related environmental justice programs will lead to increased pollution exposure, reduced protections and hindered efforts to address health disparities and promote sustainable development in marginalized communities across the nation.

While coverage of Justice40 cuts have tended to focus on EPA programs and funding, journalists should shift their reporting to identifying all projects funded through this initiative, and highlighting the fallout from its termination. They can do so by contacting federal workers who currently work or once worked in the offices relevant to Justice40 decisions; by contacting policy scholars who work on environmental justice topics; and using the mapping tool detailed below.

More about the policy

This landmark federal policy had a quantitative and equity‑driven central goal: At least 40% of the overall benefits from federal investments in climate, clean energy, housing, water infrastructure, transportation and pollution cleanup must flow to disadvantaged communities — especially communities of color, low‑income neighborhoods, Indigenous communities, and areas heavily burdened by environmental pollution or climate vulnerability. This coordinated, whole-of-government effort was managed by the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Management and Budget, the Domestic Climate Policy Office, and the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council.

Environmental justice cuts

Inside Climate News has done monumental work tracking down environmental justice cuts within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that include Justice40 projects, publishing their analyses to the open data sharing network GitHub.

Justice40 has influenced a range of federal agencies, including not only the EPA, but also the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Labor. Its impacts include expanded solar grants, clean air initiatives in schools, community energy planning, workforce development, and targeted pollution remediation — all aimed at closing historical gaps in investment and improving health and resilience in frontline communities

Justice40 coverage

Coverage of the loss of Justice40 happened amid a spate of reports about programs that ended when President Trump began his second term. Audiences had trouble keeping track of them all, and the implications remain poorly understood — leaving a knowledge gap that journalists can fill. The sweeping effects of this initiative are largely lost on American and international audiences.

Agencies identified eligible communities using the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST). Journalists can also use this tool to highlight the impacts of the loss of Justice40. The tool compiles data on environmental burdens across eight categories: climate change (such as heat burden or expected agricultural losses), energy cost and access, health (including outsized health burdens or health care access), housing issues (such as lead paint exposures, housing cost and affordability), legacy pollution (such as Superfund sites or hazardous waste facilities), transportation (accounting for traffic proximity and barriers to transit), water and wastewater, and workforce development (incorporating unemployment and educational attainment).

The map is impressively high resolution, with information on each census tract. Although this map is no longer updated, which can disrupt monitoring, some states have environmental justice mapping projects. A journalist can zoom in to their coverage area, and see which census tracts are highlighted as bearing outsized burdens of poverty and pollution, which would have qualified them for funding priority in a wide array of infrastructure and public health projects.

The guidance aims to provide communities and first responders with best practices for safe BESS installation, operation and emergency response. EPA claims the new safety guidance represents the first comprehensive federal resource addressing the complete BESS project lifecycle, from siting through emergency response.

Our friends at Fire Engineering detailed EPA’s press conference on the matter this week in New York state, which plans to deploy six gigawatts (GW) of battery storage capacity by 2030. The state has connected 6,000 storage projects to its electric grid since 2019, the EPA noted in a press release, generating about 440 megawatts (MW) of capacity, with an additional 1.3 GW in development.

In short, the main recommendations for installation include:

Follow local siting, zoning, and permitting rules.

Use high-quality system designs with modern monitoring (thermal, fire, infrared).

Involve first responders early in planning.

For incident response, the main recommendations include:

Use full PPE, including breathing apparatus.

Establish isolation zones (≥330 ft), position upwind/uphill.

Prioritize containment over extinguishment — often let fires burn out while protecting surroundings.

Monitor for toxic gases (e.g., H₂, CO, HF, HCN, HCl) and contain runoff.

Safely package and dispose of damaged batteries under EPA and DOT rules.

While BESS failure incidents have decreased since 2020, some fires have gained significant media attention.

On May 15, 2024, Gateway Energy Storage Facility in San Diego, California, experienced a fire with continued flare-ups for seven days. The facility held about 15,000 nickel manganese cobalt lithium-ion batteries. Following the incident, EPA has required the Gateway facility to conduct extensive environmental monitoring during battery handling and disposal operations and submit detailed progress reports.

In January, Vistra’s 300 MW Moss Landing battery power storage facility in California ignited, burning nearly all of the batteries inside. Community organizers have since reported hundreds of nearby residents with symptoms like bloody noses, headaches, rashes and a metallic taste in the mouth.

However, environmental assessments from real-world BESS fire incidents do not support claims of widespread contamination, according to a report prepared by The Fire & Risk Alliance for the American Clean Power (ACP) Association and released earlier this year. The Fire & Risk Alliance’s assessment reviewed 35 major BESS fire incidents in the U.S. from 2012 to 2024.

The group said air sampling after the incidents showed that toxic gas emissions dissipate quickly and do not pose public health concerns beyond the immediate fire scene. Further, the group’s report said water and soil testing from past incidents confirm that firefighting runoff does not result in hazardous contamination, as lithium-ion battery combustion byproducts have low water solubility and that standard stormwater management practices mitigate spread.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Scott_Solar_facility-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:04:07.841497

For example, the BPA officials have claimed for years that California has too much power over the region-wide energy system.","The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is responsible for providing a third of the energy in the Northwest. The BPA is a federal agency that operates under the United States Department of Energy, and it is responsible for marketing electrical power from hydroelectric projects. This federal agency recently announced that it plans to make a major shift in its affiliation with the energy markets. It plans to end ties with California and rather align with the new Southwest energy market – this change could reshape the energy landscape in the United States.

The Story Behind the Energy Market Change

The BPA has been the biggest hydropower supplier for many years, and it recently announced its intention to take a step in a new direction. As a result of this decision, many may be shocked since the agency plans on joining a new energy market based in Arkansas, instead of an energy market in California.

As a nonprofit federal administration, BPA – is planning on selling its excess energy to organisations and electric cooperatives as far away as Louisiana. According to an announcement made by BPA officials, a draft policy proposal was released on Wednesday. This policy contained the information about BPA’s plan to split from California controlled “real-time” energy market that it has been part of since 2022. Instead, it will now join a “day-ahead” energy market that is based out of Little Rock, Arkansas.

Responses of the public

The responses received from the public based on this move was quite overwhelming. It sparked severe concern and criticism from public utility commissioners and lawmakers, especially in places like Oregon and Washington. Also, big investor-owned utilities in the region, stated that it will for an increase of rates for their millions of consumers and it will lead to several grid reliability problems.

There are many critics that stand against this major decision that was made. These critics stated that the decision made by BPA to leave the California market and align with the Southwest energy market, would be costly for Northwest utilities — especially since it would serve majority of residents in the region.

Additionally, this means that there is a large amount of money that they will have to pass onto their consumers. Some of the big utilities are worried that if BPA is removed from the Western power pool, it will heighten the prices across the region, which will eventually result into expensive inefficiencies.

It is further stated that if BPA leaves the Western market, it will create several challenges. For example, if a transmission line trips off due to a wildfire, or even if a coal plant goes down, the supercomputer in Folsom can quickly reroute energy across the region. However, with the absence of BPA on its radar, a system operator in California would have to make contact with operators in Little Rock to ask what each one saw on their respective maps of the Western energy load.

The power dynamic

There are many other factors that has been contributing to this major move by BPA. For example, the BPA officials have claimed for years that California has too much power over the region-wide energy system. This is due to the fact that the California Independent System Operator is governed in part by the California Legislature.

BPA is firstly obligated to sell its power to 140 customer-owned utilities in the region. The excess power could then be sold to other consumer and private investor-owned utilities in:

Oregon,

Washington,

Idaho,

Areas of Montana,

California,

Nevada,

Utah, and

Wyoming.

Electricity is being delivered through 15,000 miles of transmission lines in oversees in the region – representing 75% of the Northwest’s high voltage transmission system.

Moreover, in announcing its plan to join the Southwest Power Pool, BPA has the support of most of the utilities it serves by law. These utilities include the backing of the Portland-based Public Power Council, which is a nonprofit industry group representing consumer-owned utilities in the Northwest that get priority purchase power from the BPA.",https://www.eldiario24.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bonneville-Power-Administration.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 18:05:17.503142

Addressing concerns about rising electricity prices linked to Biden-era policies favoring renewable energy, Burgum agreed with Energy Secretary Chris Wright's assessment. ""All of these projects, particularly offshore wind, would not exist without these massive taxpayer subsidies that were passed when Joe Biden was in office,"" Burgum said. He pointed out that some offshore projects rely heavily on tax subsidies rather than electrical generation, leading to higher costs in regions like the northeastern U.S.

Burgum also discussed the administration's efforts to reopen coal mines in Montana, Wyoming, and Utah, which he said had not happened for a decade.

,Clean Energy ,2025-08-22 19:29:00+00:00,Inside Climate News,Pennsylvania Lured Shell to the State With a $1.65 Billion Tax Break. Now ... - Inside Climate News,"Kiley Bense, Dana Drugmand",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22082025/shell-wants-to-sell-pennsylvania-ethane-cracker-plant/,"The Monaca plant—which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates—is a small part of its global portfolio.
Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.
“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said.
Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online.
Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.","In 2020, the Department of Energy predicted that Appalachia was “on the cusp of an energy and petrochemical renaissance” fueled by abundant shale gas. The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.

“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.

For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility—first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities—was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant—which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates—is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.

Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”

What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility. “Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.

As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of least 25 years.

Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.

Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.

“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.

Shell’s Tax “Windfall” in Pennsylvania

Shell’s tax breaks from the state are behind its decision to push forward with the project even as other companies walked away from the “renaissance” for economic reasons, said Anne Keller, managing director at Midstream Energy Group, an energy consultancy. Keller has worked in the energy and petrochemical industry for more than 30 years. Compared to Ohio and West Virginia, Pennsylvania “far and away shelled out more money,” she said.

In 2016, then-vice president of Shell’s Appalachia Petrochemicals Division, Ate Visser, acknowledged the role the subsidies played in its decision-making. “I can tell you, hand to my heart, that without the fiscal incentives, we would not have taken this investment decision,” he said.

Those incentives help to explain how Shell ended up stranded in a region that turned out not to make sense for petrochemical buildout in the current market.

Keller said Pennsylvania’s gift to Shell is unprecedented in the industry. “I’ve literally never heard of anything like that. It was just stunning,” she said. “The state got dealt.”

While there was some greater economic advantage to the region during construction, when more than 9,000 workers were needed, once the plant became operational and the workforce shrank to 500, “the state might as well have just put people in an office and written them a check,” Keller said. Essentially, she said, the financial benefit to the company is so large that the state is effectively off-setting the cost of all full-time employees at Monaca with the tax break.

Edwards, the company spokesperson, said Shell currently employs about 500 people in Monaca and “regularly averages” approximately 400 contractors at the site. Four hundred is the minimum number of permanent jobs required by the state’s tax agreement with Shell.

In 2012, the year the state legislature passed the $1.65 billion tax credit, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s industry and labor secretary, Julia Hearthway, said she was convinced that the Shell plant would “kickstart a chemical manufacturing boom.”

“And with it comes jobs. Not a few hun­dred jobs. Not one com­pany hir­ing 300 or 400 jobs. But thou­sands and thou­sands of jobs to Pennsylvania,” she told StateImpact Pennsylvania.

“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened.”

— Eric de Place, Ohio River Valley Institute

At one point, the Corbett administration claimed the Shell plant would spawn 20,000 permanent jobs directly and indirectly, because it would draw so many people to move to Beaver County. The administration said Shell would build its plant in another state if Pennsylvania didn’t offer enough incentives.

That same year, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center called the tax breaks “a windfall” for Shell and said the deal was expensive for taxpayers while creating few permanent jobs. That warning now appears prescient.

The economic boom and thousands of new jobs that were supposed to follow in Shell’s wake have failed to materialize, according to research conducted by the Ohio River Valley Institute.

“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened,” said Eric de Place, a research fellow at ORVI who has studied Shell Monaca. De Place’s analysis found that Beaver County’s population has declined since 2012, and it has not seen growth in jobs, GDP or businesses.

“There’s simply no way to look at economic performance and say, ‘Beaver County got this petrochemical plant and it flourished.’ In fact, it is declining relative to the U.S. and Pennsylvania, and it has not outperformed the counties around it,” he said. “I think you look at the scoreboard and you say, this was a terrible investment of taxpayer money.”

Stier said of Shell’s change of course, “The real driver of this is corporate strategy. Fifteen years ago, Shell was going in a different direction.

“It just goes to show you how big global companies can change their strategies pretty quickly. Companies can make some big, multibillion-dollar mistakes at times, and market conditions change,” Stier said. For Shell, “this asset no longer fits.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Shell-Beaver-County_Mark-Dixon-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:03:22.172391

Without comprehensive environmental and climate data, local officials, city planners, and communities might struggle to make plans to keep people safe.
While the exact cause of the Texas flooding might be inconclusive, the recent disaster highlights the stark reality that less access to accurate climate data keeps us all in the dark.","Last month, the website that hosted every edition of the National Climate Assessment went dark, marking another egregious instance of disappeared climate data and resources under the current Trump administration. Within days of this erasure, Texas’s Kerr County saw unprecedented flooding, leaving many dead and injured. The timing of the events–alongside the administration’s recent cuts to the National Weather Service and ongoing evisceration of climate data and resources–prompted some officials and media outlets to ask, what went wrong?

Floods like the one in Texas are “becoming more frequent and intense…as the burning of fossil fuels heats the planet,” according to a recent New York Times report. Kerr County sits in a FEMA designated flood zone along the Guadalupe River and, in the early hours of July 4th, saw the river surge to 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a flood watch on July 3rd, highlighting Kerrville–a city located within the county. The NWS upgraded this watch to a flash flood emergency for Kerr County at 4:03 AM, and issued a flash flood warning for Kerrville at 5:34 AM. However, this warning came 45 minutes after gauges along the Guadalupe registered over 23 feet of water. As of recent reporting, the death toll currently stands at 137 people, including more than 35 children.

What exactly led to these historic floods remains unclear. Following the disaster, there are conflicting reports on why the death toll was so high. The BBC points to the natural features of the area, such as where the Guadalupe meets a creak, while a report in Vox notes “gaps in the communication system” that also could be cause for high mortality. In the days after the flooding, an examination by Wired found that the NWS “had performed its job” and that ”the real communication breakdown had happened elsewhere.”

What is clear is that the continued deletion of critical federal data will make these events harder to predict and plan for, and could ultimately lead to disasters elsewhere.

Earlier this year, the National Security Archive published a selection of materials and screenshots detailing the Trump administration’s deletion of environmental information, datasets, and resources. At the time of publication, the White House had removed resources like the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST); the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Environmental Topics sections on its homepage; and the State Department’s Climate and Environment and Climate Crisis pages. More recently, the administration has also deleted important climate reports and datasets from agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The quadrennial National Climate Assessments–which were housed in the now defunct U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) federal website–detail the effects of climate change across the U.S. and are used by governments, communities, and businesses to make crucial decisions in relation with the assessments findings. Although the USGCRP is statutorily mandated by Congress to study the changes in Earth’s climate and environment, the program had its funding cut in April, a bellwether for the disappearing assessments.

In July, the New York Times reported that the sites contained important information about changes to weather patterns, greenhouse gas emissions, and original maps, all exceedingly important resources for city planners, engineers, and others to use to plan for floods and other climate events. A report from E&E News found that while the weather reports and predictions are accurate today, “weather predictions and forecast accuracy stand to change as Trump cements his agenda.” The growing limitations to publicly accessible weather data and climate information could have disastrous impacts.

Without comprehensive environmental and climate data, local officials, city planners, and communities might struggle to make plans to keep people safe. While the exact cause of the Texas flooding might be inconclusive, the recent disaster highlights the stark reality that less access to accurate climate data keeps us all in the dark.",https://unredacted.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-22-110743-1.png,N,,2025-08-22 23:00:31.450286

Viewed on its own, the Fifth Circuit’s opinion resolves a narrow technical issue under the Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA).
In 2019, Port Arthur LNG sought permit authorization from TCEQ to build a new liquefied natural gas liquefaction plant and export terminal.
The ALJ’s proposal for decision agreed with PACAN that Port Arthur LNG failed to show why it could not meet the lower limits in the Rio Grande LNG permit.
BACT in Texas Going Forward The Texas Supreme Court’s opinion affirms that TCEQ determines BACT on a case-by-case basis without applying absolute requirements for any specific technology.","Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s (TCEQ) issuance of an amended New Source Review (NSR) air permit to multinational joint-venture Port Arthur LNG. See Port Arthur Community Action Network v. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.1 This decision should end a four-year dispute over a TCEQ air permit to authorize construction of a new LNG plant and export terminal on the Gulf Coast. Petitioner Port Arthur Community Action Network (PACAN), has until November 10, 2025, to file a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.

The Fifth Circuit ruling applied the Texas Supreme Court’s holding of a certified question to settle the meaning of “best available control technology” (BACT) in the context of TCEQ NSR air quality permitting. The Texas Supreme Court held that BACT means “the best pollution control technology that is currently available, technically practicable, and economically reasonable,” and “has already proven, through experience and research, to be operational, obtainable, and capable of reducing emissions.” 2 Relying on the Supreme Court’s holding, the Fifth Circuit concluded that methods or technologies lacking supporting operational data did not represent BACT, even if the same emission control devices were authorized as BACT in another permit for a similar facility.

Viewed on its own, the Fifth Circuit’s opinion resolves a narrow technical issue under the Texas Clean Air Act (TCAA). For air permitting in Texas, the decision elicits several significant takeaways:

Environmental non-governmental organizations (eNGOs) are increasingly sophisticated users of the Texas contested case hearing process to stall and block permits on technical and environmental issues, as observed in an earlier alert.3 eNGOs will continue to make aggressive use of the Texas contested case hearing process in the next few years to continue supporting anti-oil and gas and anti-plastics initiatives. Applicants should expect prepared opponents litigating on policy positions who have substantial command of the facts and law applicable to permit applications.

Proposals for Decision (PFDs) by administrative law judges (ALJs) at the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) do not always align with the views of the TCEQ Commissioners, and lengthy litigation is not always avoidable. The delays in this case resulted in a nearly four-year delay. Building in time for potential delays and submitting a robust BACT analysis are important components of a defensible air permitting strategy.

The Texas Supreme Court confirmed that TCEQ’s case-by-case BACT evaluations in existing permits do not necessarily establish the same control technology as BACT for other similar facilities.

TCEQ generally takes a studied, real-world, and data-oriented approach to its programmatic implementation—BACT determinations are no different.

TCAA Background

A permit applicant must satisfy BACT for each air contaminant it seeks to emit from a proposed new or modified facility. BACT is “an air pollution control method for a new or modified facility that through experience and research, has proven to be operational, obtainable, and capable of reducing or eliminating emissions, and is considered technically practical and economically reasonable for the facility.” 4 The TCAA mandates that TCEQ require proposed new and modified facilities to “use at least the best available control technology, considering the technical practicability and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the emissions resulting from the facility.” 5

Case History

The Fifth Circuit’s decision is the latest episode in an already colorful procedural history. In 2019, Port Arthur LNG sought permit authorization from TCEQ to build a new liquefied natural gas liquefaction plant and export terminal. The TCEQ Executive Director’s staff reviewed the permit application and determined that the applicant’s proposed emissions limits of 9 parts per million (ppm) nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 25 ppm carbon monoxide (CO), achieved via use of Dry Low NOx burners and good combustion practices, satisfied BACT for proposed gas-fired refrigeration compression turbines.

After the Executive Director completed a technical review, but before the TCEQ Commissioners evaluated Port Arthur LNG’s application, TCEQ separately issued an air quality permit to an unrelated facility, Rio Grande LNG. Rio Grande LNG’s permit established more stringent emission limits of 5 ppm NOx and 15 ppm CO for the same type of turbines and method of control. In Port Arthur LNG’s contested case hearing before SOAH, local environmental organization PACAN challenged the proposed emissions limits and control methods in Port Arthur LNG’s draft permit, arguing that the recently permitted limits of the not-yet-constructed Rio Grande LNG terminal set a per se standard for BACT. The ALJ’s proposal for decision agreed with PACAN that Port Arthur LNG failed to show why it could not meet the lower limits in the Rio Grande LNG permit. The TCEQ Commissioners disagreed with the ALJ’s analysis and interpretation of the agency’s rules and guidance related to BACT in the proposal for decision and issued the permit to Port Arthur LNG with the emissions limits as originally proposed and reviewed by the Executive Director in 2020.

Because Port Arthur LNG is a natural gas facility, PACAN sought judicial review under the Natural Gas Act in the Fifth Circuit, rather than in Travis County District Court, as the Texas Administrative Procedure Act generally proscribes. A Fifth Circuit panel agreed with PACAN that the emissions limits issued to Rio Grande LNG were “successfully demonstrated” and acceptable as BACT and held that TCEQ was bound to apply Rio Grande LNG’s BACT consistently to Port Arthur LNG, a similarly situated applicant.6

Certified Question to the Texas Supreme Court

TCEQ petitioned for a rehearing en banc, and the Fifth Circuit vacated the panel’s opinion.7 The Fifth Circuit certified the following question to the Texas Supreme Court:

“Does the phrase “has proven to be operational” in Texas's definition of “best available control technology” codified at Section 116.10(1) of the Texas Administrative Code require an air pollution control method to be currently operating under a permit issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or does it refer to methods that TCEQ deems to be capable of operating in the future?” 8

The Texas Supreme Court, examined the text of the Texas Clean Air Act and regulations in the Texas Administrative Code to arrive at a definition of BACT that neither precludes nor automatically accepts standard technologies that have been permitted but are not presently operational.9 Justice Blacklock wrote:

“The certified question essentially asks how TCEQ should decide whether a pollution control method ‘has proven to be operational.’ The disputed definition provides the answer to that question by directing that the proof must come ‘through experience and research,’ which we understand to mean demonstrated, real-world experience rather than the experience of previous permit applications.” 10

This means that the definition could include technologies permitted at Rio Grande LNG, but only if there is real-world data – data generated via experience and research – that has proven the technology to be “operational, obtainable, and capable of reducing or eliminating emissions,” 11 and not just theoretical proof in the form of a permit.

The Fifth Circuit’s Decision

Back at the Fifth Circuit, and with the Texas Supreme Court’s answer to the certified question in hand, the court examined PACAN’s evidence related to its claim that the more stringent limitations issued to Rio Grande LNG met the definition of BACT and should apply to Port Arthur LNG’s permit. The court noted that PACAN’s argument – that these limitations were BACT – rested on two primary pieces of data – (1) vendor data and (2) TCEQ’s approval of Rio Grande’s limitations12 – and held that this was insufficient to prove that “the pollution control method has already been demonstrated to be operational in the real world.” 13 Instead, the vendor data and TCEQ’s confidence that these limits are achievable, amount to the mere “theoretical proof of a method’s operability in the future,” and do not satisfy the requirements in the definition of BACT.14 The court therefore denied PACAN’s petition and upheld the permit as issued by TCEQ.

BACT in Texas Going Forward

The Texas Supreme Court’s opinion affirms that TCEQ determines BACT on a case-by-case basis without applying absolute requirements for any specific technology. Instead, to prove that a technology is operational, obtainable, and capable of reducing or eliminating emissions, air permit applicants are tasked with providing evidence of real-world research and experience sufficient to demonstrate that proposed BACT is proven to be operational.

For a proposed BACT analysis based on control at a facility already operating under a TCEQ permit, the battle line is likely to shift to how the operational data from that facility impacts the methods, technologies, and facilities of the project under review. But when TCEQ permit reviewers evaluate proposed BACT with new technology or emissions limitations that cannot be traced to a presently operating facility, the real work will be in providing operational data – what experience and research – to demonstrate that such limitations are obtainable.

Permit applicants should be familiar with the limits achievable by technologies that TCEQ has not previously approved. Such technologies may nonetheless be BACT if the operational data that supports their ability to control emissions is convincingly solid, whether via academic research, adoption in other jurisdictions, or anything else that qualifies as ‘experience and research’ sufficient to demonstrate the technology’s efficacy. As the Fifth Circuit decision illustrates, however, mere vendor guarantees coupled with an issued permit are not sufficient to clear this bar.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15478_5804.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:04:26.011813

Tax credit 101 The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years.
Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.
Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%.
She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches.","The clock is ticking on the federal EV tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, worth up to $7,500. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the credit, which expires Sept. 30.

But this week the IRS clarified that the deadline has a little bit of flexibility. Specifically, as long as a shopper enters a binding contract to buy a vehicle before Sept. 30, the purchase can qualify for the tax credit — even if the car isn't actually delivered until later.

A payment before the deadline is also required. ""A payment includes a nominal downpayment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS notes. The tax credit won't actually be granted until the buyer takes possession of the car, but as long as the binding contract was in place before the deadline, it won't matter that the transfer happened afterward.

The IRS has typically used delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit; for example, if your vehicle would have qualified for a tax credit in 2024 but not in 2025, and you took delivery on January 1, you were out of luck.

But it's not unprecedented for the agency to base eligibility on the date a contract was signed.

""The IRS has used this exact same language before, when the rules for claiming the credit changed after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed,"" notes Sean Tucker, the lead editor of Kelley Blue Book.

And the new guidance is also consistent with what lawmakers argued during debates over the the tax and spending package, when two Republican members of Congress stated that it was the ""legislative intent"" of Congress to treat a binding contract as a purchase.

Andy Phillips, the vice president of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, says the added wiggle room will be particularly helpful for car shoppers who want to buy a vehicle that's located in another state and needs to be shipped to them, or who would like to order a car that hasn't yet been manufactured. In both cases, they might run out of time to get the car delivered before the deadline.

""I can't give you exact numbers of how many people will now be able to take advantage of this credit"" because of the IRS update, he says. ""But what I can tell you is for the people that know the vehicle they want, this added flexibility will make a meaningful difference to them.""

Tax credit 101

The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years. (Here's our most recent guide.) Unlike most tax credits, this one can now be received up-front, in the form of a discount on a vehicle purchase.

For new vehicles, the tax credits are worth up to $7,500. Vehicles have to be under a specific price cap, be made in North America, and contain a certain percentage of battery minerals and components that come from the U.S. and certain allied countries.

Meanwhile, to be eligible for the credit, buyers have to earn less than $150,000 adjusted gross income ($300,000 for married couples) — that's income after tax-deductible retirement contributions.

Qualifying vehicles are listed here, and include many Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia models, as well as the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Chrysler Pacifica PHEV. In each case, shoppers need to confirm with a dealer that an individual car qualifies for the credit — not all do.

Meanwhile, there's also a used vehicle credit worth up to $4,000 for EVs at least two years old that are sold for less than $25,000.

And for people who choose to lease rather than buy, $7,500 can be put toward the lease of any EV, without restrictions on price, manufacturing location or buyer income — a loophole that has pleased many automakers and frustrated many EV tax credit critics.

A looming deadline

EV and plug-in hybrid sales in the U.S. grew rapidly from 2020 to 2023. But despite continued growth overseas, since then they have been stuck in neutral in the U.S., holding steady at around 10% of the market. That was disappointing for automakers and environmentalists alike.

Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.

Analysts expect a near-term bump in EV sales, as buyers and dealers race to get ahead of the deadline, followed by a drop in sales. Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%. Earlier this month, Stephanie Valdez Streaty of Cox predicted that ""urgency is likely to remain high"" as the tax credits near expiration, and sales will be strong through the end of September.

In the long run, electric vehicles are still expected to grow in popularity, albeit slower than predicted, and automakers are still investing in new EVs designed to be cheaper.

Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the auto data company Edmunds, says the loss of the tax credit is ""pretty daunting"" for automakers, as they also navigate shifting tariffs and high interest rates.

She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches. ""I don't think a lot of consumers are necessarily aware this is happening,"" she says.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called the EPA’s proposal “misguided.”

“Ignoring common sense, including scientific research from our own government, is a recipe for disaster,” he said in a press release.

The EPA is challenging the underlying science used in the endangerment finding and said the rule has been used to justify more than $1 trillion in regulations. It has also said that the auto industry has suffered from “significant uncertainties” amid these emission regulations.

“Finally, EPA is proposing to provide much needed certainty and regulatory relief, so companies can plan appropriately, and the American people can have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car,” an agency press release stated.

This comes as the Trump administration rolls back policies promoting electric vehicles.

At the time of publication, the EPA had received more than 70,000 comments online regarding the plan. The agency had initially planned to host two full days of virtual public comments this week, but added two more to meet the demand.

Under the IRA and Obama-era guidance, developers were able to exploit flexible construction standards that allowed them to “begin” projects with minimal effort or investment, locking in lucrative tax credits long before real work occurred. These loopholes fueled speculation, inflated project valuations, and raised concerns that taxpayer dollars were subsidizing paperwork rather than power generation.

In coordination with Congress’ efforts to end these tax credits and their persistent abuses, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources” on July 7, 2025. This Executive Order required the Treasury and Interior Departments to issue new guidance within 45 days to enforce the termination of tax credits under the OBBB and eliminate loopholes and carveouts for the ITC and PTC.

Guidance Gives Guardrails

When Congress passes a law, executive agencies often issue guidance documents detailing how that law will be implemented and applied. Guidance documents determine the practical application of the law and set the documentation requirements and deadlines that ultimately decide who qualifies to receive benefits. The U.S. Department of the Treasury is responsible for issuing and enforcing the rules that govern tax credits for energy projects.

Old Energy Tax Credit Guidance Loopholes

To qualify for a tax credit, developers must demonstrate that it is a valid energy project by meeting a construction requirement. Under the old guidance associated with the IRA, construction requirements could be satisfied by either a physical work test or a safe harbor investment provision.

The old physical work test required “physical work of a significant nature,” which includes both on-site work and off-site work. Developers could “start construction” by performing off-site activities, such as manufacturing parts, without beginning any actual on-site construction. Contract start dates for custom projects served as a “beginning of construction date” for projects and allowed off-site work to count as physical work of a significant nature.

Even when work was done on-site, developers could perform limited work, such as digging a few foundation holes, constructing temporary roads, or pouring a concrete pad, and argue that this counted as “significant”. Since there was no dollar amount or percentage of project completion requirement tied to the physical work test, developers were often granted the benefit of the doubt in determining whether the requirement was met.

The safe harbor provision required companies to invest a minimum of 5 percent of the project’s estimated total cost to qualify for the ITC or PTC. Under the old guidance, this allowed companies to count expenditures such as ordering parts for wind or solar systems, or contracting out their design toward the 5 percent investment minimum without needing to install the components ordered on-site.

New Guidance Closes Doors, but Leaves Room for Runarounds

The new guidance released by the Treasury closes some of these loopholes. However, it still leaves room for some runarounds, allowing subsidies for certain green energy projects.

The most significant change in the new guidance is the elimination of the safe harbor provision, effective September 2, 2025. Ending this provision is a step in the right direction, as it forces developers to demonstrate real physical progress in order to qualify for a tax credit, rather than merely writing checks.

However, the guidance also includes a carveout for “low-output” solar projects of 1.5 megawatts or less. These solar projects would continue to qualify for the 5 percent investment safe harbor. The carveout was designed with residential solar arrays in mind; however, most residential solar systems in the United States are between six and eight kilowatts. Producing one megawatt of electricity requires roughly 10 acres of land dedicated to solar arrays. As a result, this carveout allows solar farms to continue accessing the tax credit under the old safe harbor provisions rather than limiting it to homeowners installing smaller-scale systems.

For solar projects above 1.5 megawatts, developers must now use the physical work test to establish that construction begins by July 4, 2026. This requires showing “work of a significant nature” and meeting a continuity requirement.

Yet the definition of “significant” remains vague. The new guidance does not establish minimum hours, dollar amounts, or percentage of total project costs specified for either on-site or off-site work to satisfy this requirement. As the new guidance states, “This test focuses on the nature of the work performed, not the amount or the cost.” This leaves the determination of whether a project qualifies to the judgment of the Treasury official reviewing the credit claim, rather than providing strict criteria that must be met. Both on-site and off-site work continue to count toward the physical work test.

Other loopholes also remain. One is the treatment of transformers. Transformers are used to adjust the voltage of the electricity produced to a level suitable for the grid. While transformers are integral to electricity production, they are not always installed on site. Often, they are installed at local and central substations. The new rules allow off-site work at qualified facilities, including transformer production and installation, to count as “significant” physical work. This means developers can claim to have met the physical work test by manufacturing transformers or installing them at substations, rather than by building on the actual project site itself.

Similarly, the custom contract carveout survives. A developer can still order custom equipment to be designed and produced, such as turbine blades, inverters, and solar panels, and use the date work pertaining to the contract began as the construction start date. Even if developers do not perform work on-site, as long as work specified in the contract begins, then developers are able to claim the credit.

The guidance also continues the policy allowing developers to bundle multiple facilities together as a single project for credit purposes. Developers with multiple facilities can bundle those facilities into one project for the purpose of meeting the beginning of construction deadline. Factors used to determine whether facilities should be classified as a single project include whether they are located on contiguous pieces of land, share a common power purchase agreement, rely on a shared substation, or operate under a master construction contract. The one positive feature of this rule is that it ensures several small systems totaling more than 1.5 megawatts, if integrated, are treated as a single large project and must meet the construction requirement rather than exploiting the safe harbor exemption.

Room for Improvement, Reasons for Optimism

An additional opportunity still remains for guidance to further the policy goals of the OBBB. The Treasury has not provided directions on how the foreign entities of concern provisions in the OBBB will apply to developers. This guidance is expected to come later and could include provisions which will mandate developers prove their lack of ties or cut ties immediately to entities such as China. This provision could eliminate many of the projects by effectively removing a major supplier of wind and solar components as well as the rare earths those systems rely on.

The new guidance takes an important step toward tightening the rules for ITC and PTC eligibility, but its impact will ultimately depend on how rigorously Treasury enforces the definition of “significant” for the physical work test and how they address the role of foreign entities of concern. Without strong and consistent administration, developers may still exploit loopholes, weakening the policy goals Congress and the Administration intended to advance.",https://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kateryna-hliznitsova-4QvICQFcmtc-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:04:22.167881

Pat Fallon (R-Texas), opinion contributor, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5464759-wind-turbine-radar-safety-concerns/,"It only takes the slightest radar interference to cause air traffic to spiral into an emergency diversion or a loss of situational awareness during critical flight phases.
But over the last few decades, numerous reports have corroborated what many in the energy and national security fields have long said: Offshore wind turbines cause interference for radar systems.

But over the last few decades, numerous reports have corroborated what many in the energy and national security fields have long said: Offshore wind turbines cause interference for radar systems.

Due to their large towers and moving blades reflecting electromagnetic radiation in the surrounding area, offshore wind turbines interfere with the radar systems used by the Coast Guard, Navy and Air Force to stay apprised of foreign military movement off of our coasts and just outside of U.S. airspace.

But what’s often left out of the discourse regarding the ill-advised push for a “net-zero” carbon footprint is that sweeping renewable mandates and green energy subsidies have led to safety concerns being swept under the rug and ignored as companies fill campaign coffers in order to get their turbine projects approved.

The ubiquitous development of offshore wind turbines in recent years is a multifaceted problem, with turbines disrupting our radar systems and putting air traffic in jeopardy, while the “all in” approach to renewable energy has left us increasingly economically beholden to the whims of China.

The lack of any semblance of progress in finding a solution to these problems is troubling. The Wind Turbine-Radar Interference Mitigation Working Group has already reached its 2025 deadline and is no closer to addressing the radar interference created by wind turbines than when the memorandum of agreement was signed between multiple government agencies in 2014. Despite this, the previous administration continued to push forward with approving offshore wind project permits in critical U.S. coastal waters, leaving future policymakers to deal with the repercussions.

Regulatory authority has also changed. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has surpassed and now outweighs the jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Authority in the FAA’s own domain. This means that not only are U.S. air traffic controllers struggling to find a reliable and stable workforce, but they are also being forced to concede to the discretion of a smaller agency that does not have authority and, frankly, the proper understanding of the minutiae of the situation at hand.

In truth, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management should be more focused on the mission they were established for — stabilizing our critical mineral supply chain. Nowhere in the FAA’s mission does it allow the agency to abandon its authority over U.S. commercial airspace to an agency within the Department of the Interior whose mission is managing the development of energy and mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf.

On the national security front, China currently holds the advantage when it comes to manufacturing wind turbines and other energy-related components, forcing the U.S. and our allies to become dependent on a market that for the past decade has been cornered by firms that answer only to the Chinese Communist Party.

Our dependency on China for critical minerals threatens our national security and supply chains, as China has shown it has no qualms with weaponizing trade deals and manipulating the market to undermine the West economically. To make matters worse, the Biden administration’s overly complex regulatory apparatus contributed to a running theme where the U.S. couldn’t seem to get out of its own way when it came to meeting consequential energy or national security objectives.

With the carried threats to the homeland posed by U.S. adversaries like China, U.S. economic and national security must be prioritized. Thankfully, things are headed in the right direction under President Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s leadership, with the Department of Energy openly admitting and treating wind turbine interference as the national security threat it is.

For these reasons, it’s clear we should strengthen Trump’s executive order for temporary withdrawal of all areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from offshore wind leasing to extend it to include shared waterways with our neighbors, Canada and Mexico. This would effectively prevent further leases for offshore wind turbines from being issued in these areas that are of strategic importance. For this reason, I have introduced legislation to support codifying Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order into law.

We should extend this leasing and permitting pause until there is a permanent and successful solution for the radar interference posed by offshore wind turbines, and the U.S. is able to establish a secure and reliable critical mineral supply chain that doesn’t lead through Beijing.

Without strict sustainability standards, the ""green"" hydrogen label risks losing credibility.
The Road Ahead The race to lead the hydrogen economy is on, and the Middle East is in pole position.","For centuries, the Middle East has been at the center of global trade and energy. From the days of ancient trade routes to becoming the world's biggest oil exporter after the first major discovery in Iran in 1908, the region has shaped the global energy story like no other. But today, a new chapter is unfolding, one where the Middle East isn't just about oil, but about green hydrogen.

Countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Qatar are reimagining their future. Instead of clinging to fossil fuels, they're putting serious money and strategy into becoming leaders in the hydrogen economy. And this isn't just about energy exports, it's about transforming economies, attracting investment, and meeting global decarbonization goals.

Why Green Hydrogen Matters

So, what makes green hydrogen so exciting? For starters, it's one of the most versatile clean fuels out there. It can power electricity, heating, transport, and industry, especially the tough-to-decarbonize sectors like steel, cement, and shipping.

The International Energy Agency's 2024 Global Hydrogen Review shows global hydrogen demand hit 97 megatons (Mt) in 2023, up 2.5% from 2022. But here's the catch: most of it still comes from fossil fuels. Truly ""green"" hydrogen, made using renewable energy, is still under 1 Mt. Electrolyzer capacity is growing fast (520 GW already lined up for 2030), but scaling it up at competitive costs remains the big challenge.

The Cost Advantage: Sunshine, Wind, and Geography

If you're wondering why the Middle East is so well-positioned, the answer is simple: it's cheap to make hydrogen here. With world-beating solar and wind resources, the region can generate renewable energy at some of the lowest costs globally.

Saudi Arabia set a world record in 2021 with a solar PPA at just $0.0104/kWh. The Al Sadawi Solar PV Project is expected to continue this trend with costs as low as $0.0129/kWh. Compare that to Europe, where hydrogen production costs are $9.88 to $14.31 per kg versus just $6.54 to $12.66 per kg in the Middle East, and you see the edge.

Add to this vast undeveloped land, existing energy infrastructure, and well-placed ports like Dubai, Sohar, and Yanbu, and the region has all the ingredients to become a global green hydrogen hub.

Mega-Projects and Global Partnerships

Saudi Arabia's NEOM Project: An $8.4 billion investment to build the world's largest green hydrogen plant, expected to produce 600 tons daily by 2026.

UAE's Hydrogen Roadmap: Ambitious goals for 2050, with Masdar teaming up with Siemens Energy and Lufthansa to push hydrogen for transport.

Oman's Vision 2040: Plans for a 25 GW wind-solar electrolyzer cluster.

These projects are backed by heavyweight investors like ACWA Power and Air Products and are already shaping global partnerships. Germany's SEFE, for example, is teaming up with NEOM to bring Middle Eastern hydrogen to Europe.

The Challenges Ahead

Rising Costs: NEOM's budget has already ballooned 70% from its original $5 billion.

Water Scarcity: Electrolysis needs water, and desalination isn't without environmental costs.

Geopolitics: Tensions in the region could disrupt exports, just as they have with oil in the past.

Global Competition: Australia, Chile, and others are also racing to claim leadership in the hydrogen market.

Sustainability and Credibility

Here's the kicker: being cheap isn't enough. For hydrogen to truly be ""green,"" it has to come from new renewable sources, not just existing grids. Plus, the production, storage, and shipping processes carry their own carbon costs.

This is why transparency and certification matter. Without strict sustainability standards, the ""green"" hydrogen label risks losing credibility. If the Middle East can lead not just in low-cost production but also in responsible, verifiable green practices, it can secure a dominant global role.

The Road Ahead

The race to lead the hydrogen economy is on, and the Middle East is in pole position. With its unmatched natural resources, government backing, and mega-projects already underway, the region could be the world's next big clean energy powerhouse.

But success won't be handed to it. It will take investment, transparency, and a relentless focus on sustainability to prove that hydrogen from the Middle East is not just affordable but also trustworthy and truly green.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 19:04:43.622283

NLC Energy Denmark LLC, which operates a biogas facility in the village of Denmark, filed for Chapter 11 protection on 16 August in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The company is attempting to restructure around $76 million (€70 million) in secured debt.

Court filings show the firm has faced losses of roughly $1 million (€920,000) per month. NLC, which employs about 30 people, continues to process food waste and manure into renewable natural gas at its Denmark plant, which remains operational.

The business was founded in 2008 under the name NEW Organic Digestion LLC, originally running a food waste digester that generated biomethane for electricity production. In 2016, the operation expanded through a joint venture that included acquiring a second site in South Sioux City, Nebraska.

Difficulties soon followed. Shortly after the expansion, local sewer backups led to legal disputes and fines totalling $1.8 million (€1.65 million). A separate incident in 2019, when a supplier altered feedstock without notice, caused a prolonged shutdown of the Nebraska facility.

Financial pressure intensified in later years. A 20-year contract signed with the University of California in 2016 to purchase methane was undermined by underperformance in gas production and delays to expansion work.

By 2020, the company had fallen behind on debt repayments. An attempt in 2022 to renegotiate gas prices with the university failed, forcing the firm to continue operating at a loss.

The largest secured creditors include the University of California, which claims $8.6 million (€7.9 million), along with other financial institutions listed in the bankruptcy records.

Wisconsin is home to more than 300 methane digesters, with around 50 located on dairy farms, according to the state’s Public Service Commission. Most facilities inject biomethane into interstate pipelines, with significant value tied to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which rewards projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bigstock-Biogas-Plant-For-Power-Generat-369883618-768x621.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 18:03:27.015966

In a news release titled, “Federal Transit Administration to Ditch Green New Deal Carbon Scam, Move to Unleash American Energy,” Molinaro said the agency has proposed removing the carbon-reducing language from the Capital Investment Grants program, or CIG, the federal government’s largest discretionary grant program to fund transit capital investments, including heavy rail, commuter rail, light rail, streetcars, and bus rapid transit.

In a news release titled, “Federal Transit Administration to Ditch Green New Deal Carbon Scam, Move to Unleash American Energy,” Molinaro said the agency has proposed removing the carbon-reducing language from the Capital Investment Grants program, or CIG, the federal government’s largest discretionary grant program to fund transit capital investments, including heavy rail, commuter rail, light rail, streetcars, and bus rapid transit.

Molinaro, who was confirmed as FTA administrator earlier this month, is a former Republican Dutchess County Executive and House representative for the 19th Congressional District.

“President Trump charged the Department of Transportation with unleashing American energy so we can lower costs and grow the economy,” Molinaro said in a statement. “Under (Department of Transportation) Secretary (Sean) Duffy’s leadership, we’re doing just that. These proposed actions remove unnecessary regulatory requirements and provide the best support possible for locally driven transit projects.”

The agency has requested feedback on the new standards to continue the process of updating CIG Policy Guidance, which provides direction to project sponsors pursuing CIG construction grants, an FTA news release said.

“Following feedback from our transit industry partners, FTA is proposing to remove the overly complex social cost of carbon calculation from the Environmental Benefits section of the CIG Policy Guidance,” the release said “Instead, FTA will revert back to a previously-used methodology that relies on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards designation based on which city a transit project is located.”

Ulster County Executive Jen Metzger, who appeared before an Environmental Protection Agency panel Thursday, said the FTA proposal is disheartening.

Metzger, who is a longtime environmental activist, told the EPA panel not to weaken environmental protections.

“While the CIG program is not applicable to Ulster County, it is nonetheless concerning to see the abandonment of tools like the social cost of carbon estimates, which play a critical role in evaluating the long-term environmental and public health impacts of federal transit investments,” Metzger said in an email. “In Ulster County, we remain fully committed to advancing clean, efficient public transit solutions that reduce harmful emissions while improving transportation options for our residents.”

During his tenure as Dutchess County Executive and as a congressman, Molinaro supported several initiatives to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gasses.

In 2017, Dutchess County joined a Central Hudson program while Molinaro was county executive to purchase four all-electric vehicles at a 33% discount off the manufacturer’s price.

At the time, Molinaro said the purchase of the vehicles “goes hand in hand with our efforts to promote clean, renewable energy throughout Dutchess County.”

In 2019, Molinaro announced the state Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) had given the county a Bronze Level designation in the New York State-Certified Climate Smart Community program. Dutchess County and the Town of Red Hook, at the time, were the only local municipalities that had achieved any level of Climate Smart Community Certification designation.

Molinaro and County Legislature Chairman Gregg Pulver established the Climate Smart Communities Task Force in November 2018 to review the elements of the Climate Smart Communities program in order to certify Dutchess County as a Bronze Level CSC within 12-18 months.

“Dutchess County remains steadfast in its commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and protecting the environment for this generation and the ones that follow,” Molinaro said in the announcement. “Our county has taken numerous proactive steps to become less dependent on fossil fuels, more energy-efficient, and to promote the use of clean energy, all of which mitigate our impact on our environment.”

In 2024, as a congressman, Molinaro introduced federal legislation to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of methane by incentivizing dairy farmers to adopt clean energy practices.

The EV company looks to boost its low share price amid a 30% decline this year

Shoppers at a Lucid showroom in Southern California. The EV maker is seeking to boost its share price through a reverse stock split.

Lucid Group Inc. is trying to shake off share-price weakness by unveiling a new version of its electric SUV and by pursuing a reverse stock split soon.

Lucid (LCID) recently unveiled a new ""concept"" car, the Gravity X - a full-size SUV the company dubs ""a trail-ready adventure vehicle."" Its board also recently approved the reverse stock split, effective Sept. 2.

Larger investors tend to shy away from stocks trading in the lower-single-digit range, as is the case with Lucid, as they raise concerns over an ability to sustain uptrends. Lucid's stock has held in a range between $2 and $5 per share since it last closed above $5 on Dec. 14, 2023.

The electric-vehicle company's shares have lost about a third of their value so far this year, contrasting with gains of about 10% for the S&P 500 index SPX. The losses follow a 28% stumble last year and a decline of nearly 40% in 2023. Lucid shares last posted yearly gains in 2021, the year the company went public, when they rose 280%.

Part of the appeal of Lucid has been its deep pockets: The company is backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign investment fund, which is its majority owner. Saudi Arabia last year alone invested $1 billion in the company, and Lucid is building an EV plant there.

The Gravity itself is Lucid's next car, and the most expensive trim is available for orders now. A cheaper ""touring"" trim, starting at around $80,000, will be available later this year. Lucid's first vehicle is the Air, an electric luxury sedan starting at about $70,000.

Both Lucid and Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN), which focuses on ""adventure"" EV trucks, cut their 2025 guidance on macroeconomic concerns. The EV landscape in the U.S. has become trickier, with federal tax credits implemented by the Biden administration set to expire in September.

Competition from future EVs has also heated up: Ford Motor Co. (F) recently unveiled plans to make an electric midsize pickup truck it says it will sell for about $30,000.

Related: EVs put Ford and other automakers at a crossroads: Who will innovate the assembly line of the future?

Legacy automakers such as Ford and General Motors Co. (GM) can use their internal-combustion-engine businesses to ""subsidize EV loss-making production"", RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan said in a recent note. That is a ""competitive problem for pure-play EV makers who need to reach volume levels to become profitable,"" he added.

Lucid also tweaked its 2025 vehicle-production guidance to 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles, versus a prior expectation of 20,000. It sold 10,241 vehicles and produced 9,029 vehicles last year. The company also guided for capital expenditures between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, compared with a previous guidance of $1.4 billion.

The EV maker is planning to offer cheaper EVs, on a new midsize platform, late next year. Lucid is also hoping to launch a robotaxi service in 2026, in partnership with ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) and autonomous-driving company Nuro Inc.

30%: Global Battery Production Keeps Skyrocketing

CATL Battery Plant

About five years ago, there was no such thing as “too many batteries.” Now the world’s battery production capacity is badly out of sync with demand. Chinese manufacturers are part of the story, but so is the deliberate throttling of EV sales in North America after favorable policies were rolled back.

Here are some numbers. The global EV battery production capacity is expected to hit 3,930 gigawatt hours this year, while demand is forecast at just 1,161 GWh, according to S&P Mobility data cited by Nikkei. And that figure doesn’t even include under-construction Chinese plants, whose capacity remains undisclosed.

The production surge is led by Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL), the world’s biggest battery maker, followed by BYD, the largest EV and plug-in hybrid manufacturer, according to Korea’s SNE Research. Japanese and Korean players that once dominated lithium-ion cell production are losing their global share.

An EV battery has anodes, cathodes, separators and electrolytes. The anode stores ions when charging; the cathode receives them when discharging and dictates much of the battery’s performance, capacity, voltage, density and lifespan. Separators keep the two apart (No touching!), while electrolytes shuttle ions between them.

Believe it or not, but each requires its own suppliers and facilities. Much of the recent capacity boom has come from scaling production of these materials, too. Some giants, like CATL, BYD and LG Energy Solution, are vertically integrating to make more of these components in-house. But most still rely on specialized suppliers for each of these materials.

Now due to the overcapacity, battery makers are delaying or shelving projects. Panasonic won’t reach peak output at its new Kansas plant until 2027, Nikkei reported. Weakening demand from Tesla, Panasonic’s main customer, is part of the reason. Although the refreshed Model Ys have flooded New York City streets—I see them everywhere, everyday—nationwide sales have been slow so far this year. And LGES last year slowed down the construction of its battery plant in Michigan.

Longer term, though, overcapacity could choke off raw material extraction, slowing the supply chain just as EV demand is projected to surge again after 2030.

60%: Japanese Automakers Pass Tariff Costs To Consumers

Photo by: Suvrat Kothari

The initial response from many foreign automakers to the Trump administration’s tariffs was to wait and watch, hold prices steady and absorb the added costs. But no business can shoulder those expenses indefinitely. That breaking point has now arrived.

Here’s what Nikkei reported on Thursday:

Japanese automakers first responded by lowering export prices to keep U.S. retail prices steady. The fall in average prices also was influenced by a shift in the product mix—fewer expensive large vehicles and a higher share of small and midsize cars.

But there were doubts about the sustainability of this approach. Automakers cannot keep swallowing tariff costs without hurting their profitability.

Now, more automakers are passing on some of the tariff cost to retail prices. Toyota Motor raised prices in the U.S. in July. The average increase for Toyota-brand models was $270, less than the full cost of the tariff.

The tariff on Japanese auto imports has been cut from 27.5% to 15%, though it’s still unclear when the lower rate will actually take effect. Once it does, automakers will be hoping for some consistency after what has been a turbulent year.

90%: Lower U.S. Tariffs On European Carmakers Are Coming

The current 27.5% tariff on European car imports is hitting automakers hard and threatening to push up prices for U.S. buyers. But Washington and Brussels are now working on a deal to reduce that rate to 15%, mirroring the proposed cut on Japanese imports.

In return, the EU would drop its own tariffs on certain U.S. industrial goods and grant “preferential market access” to a wide range of American seafood and agricultural exports. Both sides aim to have the new rates take effect by August 1, according to Reuters.

Even at 15%, the tariffs would still cost automakers billions, but the cut would soften the blow. The stakes are particularly high in the luxury segment, where brands such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Audi ship the bulk of their U.S.-bound vehicles directly from Europe.

100%: What Happens During Battery Oversupply?

Tesla Megapack energy storage system

We’re already seeing this play out in the U.S. Demand is expected to slow after the end of the federal tax credits, but battery production won’t slow with the switch of a flip.

LG Energy Solution, for example, is shifting its focus towards making lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries domestically for grid-scale utility storage. These massive packs—often sized in megawatt-hours—are meant to support transmission grids and AI data centers.

But with oversupply hitting the market, questions remain: Will the excess simply sit in factories or warehouses? How will unsold batteries age over time? And what capacity fade concerns need to be addressed as these overproduced batteries sit idle?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ojG0lp/s1/cm-8-28.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 15:04:23.465953

Google’s new data provides a clearer picture of what it takes to run AI systems like Gemini.","Google has released new data showing the energy, carbon, and water use linked to its Gemini AI system. The report is one of the most detailed disclosures from a major tech company about the environmental footprint of artificial intelligence.

The numbers per query seem small, but the rise of AI worldwide makes these findings crucial. They help us grasp the larger sustainability challenge. Let’s examine Google’s report findings.

From Queries to Carbon: Measuring AI’s True Cost

Artificial intelligence systems require powerful data centers to process user prompts. These data centers run on large amounts of electricity and water for cooling. To provide more transparency, Google calculated the average environmental cost of a single Gemini AI text query.

The company reported that one prompt:

Uses about 0.24 watt-hours of electricity (similar to watching TV for less than nine seconds)

Produces about 0.03 grams of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e)

Consumes about 0.26 milliliters of water (roughly five drops)

Google looked at the energy used to run AI and also considered the electricity used when the system is idle. Additionally, it factored in the extra infrastructure that supports data centers.

The chart below shows how much energy different AI models use for each prompt. The results come from two types of data: estimates (gray) and direct measurements (black, red, and blue).

It also shows that results can vary a lot depending on how the energy use is measured. For example, the model Llama 3.1 (70B) was found to handle anywhere from about 580 prompts to 3,600 prompts per kilowatt-hour, depending on the method used.

By comparison, Google’s Gemini Apps prompts had a narrower and more consistent range of results. By releasing these figures, the company hopes to create a standard way of reporting AI’s environmental impact.

Smarter, Faster—But Still Energy Hungry

Google reported that Gemini has become much more efficient compared to earlier versions. On a per-query basis, the AI now uses about 33 times less energy than it did a year ago. This improvement comes from advances in hardware, optimized algorithms, and better data center operations.

However, efficiency gains do not necessarily mean lower overall emissions. The demand for AI services is growing rapidly, leading to more total queries. As a result, even though each prompt is cheaper in energy terms, the combined usage continues to increase.

This trend is an example of the “Jevons paradox,” where greater efficiency can lead to higher total consumption when demand rises quickly. Google’s own environmental report shows this effect. The company’s total greenhouse gas emissions have risen 51% since 2019, with AI being a key driver.

Data Centers and Their Rising Power Needs

Google’s data centers are at the heart of AI operations. In 2024, these facilities consumed 30.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity, more than double the amount in 2020. This sharp rise highlights the scale of resources required to support AI growth.

At the same time, Google has made efforts to reduce the climate impact of its facilities. Even as electricity demand increased by 27%, the company cut its direct data center emissions by 12%. This was achieved through clean energy contracts, efficiency upgrades, and improved cooling technologies.

Google has made deals with utilities in Indiana and Tennessee. These agreements enable Google to lower data center power use when grid demand is high. This strategy, known as demand response, helps prevent blackouts and lowers stress on local power systems.

Beyond Wind and Solar: Google’s Nuclear Bet

While renewable energy remains central to Google’s strategy, the company is also exploring new approaches to meet the constant power needs of AI. Key actions include:

Advanced nuclear power: The company partners with Kairos Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority. This will support molten salt nuclear reactors. They can deliver reliable, low-carbon energy.

Demand-response agreements: Reducing electricity use during peak times in states like Indiana and Tennessee to ease grid strain.

Expanded clean energy contracts: Securing renewable sources to match rising data center demand.

These steps show that Google is pursuing a mix of solutions beyond traditional renewables. Nuclear power, in particular, is seen as a stable complement to solar and wind for 24/7 operations.

Transparency or Greenwashing? The Debate Over Metrics

Google’s decision to share detailed per-query metrics has been praised as a step toward industry-wide accountability. Few tech companies have provided such clear data. This transparency helps policymakers, researchers, and the public see the real costs of AI.

At the same time, experts have raised concerns about what the report leaves out. Some argue that Google’s calculations do not fully account for indirect emissions or the impact of where electricity is sourced. Others note that per-query figures, while helpful, may downplay the large-scale effects of billions of queries worldwide.

SEE THIS: ChatGPT Hits 700M Weekly Users, But at What Environmental Cost?

The contrast between small individual costs and large overall emissions illustrates the complexity of the issue. It shows why companies need efficient technology and broad strategies. They have to manage total demand and align with climate targets.

Can AI Innovation Outpace Emissions?

Google’s disclosure highlights the balancing act facing the entire AI industry. On one hand, new technology can drive efficiency, reduce per-query energy use, and open pathways to sustainable power. On the other hand, the sheer scale of AI adoption risks outpacing these improvements.

For AI to grow in a sustainable way, companies will need to combine efficiency gains with renewable energy, nuclear solutions, and smarter grid management. Transparency will also play a central role in building trust and creating common standards across the sector.

As more companies adopt AI and integrate it into daily life, the question of energy and carbon costs will become even more urgent. Google’s report is an early attempt to measure and address this challenge.

Whether the industry can keep total emissions in check while meeting growing demand will shape the future relationship between AI and the environment.

Google’s new data provides a clearer picture of what it takes to run AI systems like Gemini. One prompt uses just a few drops of water and a tiny bit of carbon. But when billions of people interact, the environmental impact grows massively.

By being transparent about these numbers, Google has set a benchmark for the industry. The next challenge will be to turn these insights into broader changes that ensure AI grows without driving emissions sharply higher. The path forward will require innovation, investment, and cooperation across the technology and energy sectors.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2423181141.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 16:04:27.888473

The Office of Management and Budget approved a fiscal 2025 spending plan for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that would claw back remaining funds at most of the agency’s line offices. The result is roughly $239 million less overall than the current enacted budget for NOAA’s six line offices, according to data obtained by Bloomberg Government.

Spokespeople for the Office of Management and Budget and NOAA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the spending plan.

NOAA’s National Ocean Service and its Oceanic and Atmospheric Research office, which does climate research, would see the biggest decreases under the fiscal 2025 plan. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating the research office, while the National Marine Fisheries Service and NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service also would take budget hits under the OMB plan.

OMB’s spending plan for the remainder of fiscal 2025, which ends on Sept. 30, attempts to align NOAA’s current budget with the hefty funding cuts President Donald Trump sought for the agency in fiscal 2026.

Much of the government is operating on a continuing resolution for funding. The fiscal 2024 enacted discretionary appropriations for NOAA based on the spending plan is $6.3 billion. The administration’s fiscal 2025 spending plan would eat into the remaining unobligated money for the agency. It also would set the stage for a fiscal 2026 decrease, with Congress expected to pass another continuing resolution for all, or part, of fiscal 2026 to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1.

The National Weather Service, which Republicans and Democrats have sought to protect, particularly in the wake of this summer’s deadly flooding in Texas, would see an increase of about a $15 million in the fiscal 2025 spending plan OMB approved. The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations also would receive a boost under the plan.

“Overall, this seems to reflect a scooping up of funding at the end of the year likely not obligated yet due to all the staffing reductions and freezes and slow rolling of NOAA acquisition and grant approvals,” John Potts, a former chief financial officer at the National Weather Service and NOAA budget director, said in an interview.

Potts, who retired in February after spending more than 30 years at NOAA, said the clawbacks will “further hamper NOAA’s mission and program execution” in fiscal 2026 and beyond, especially at non-National Weather Service components “focused on weather and climate research, climate resilience, fisheries management and geomagnetic storm detection.”

He added the proposed clawbacks from OMB related to fiscal 2025 funds are likely not unique to NOAA.

Trump proposed $4.5 billion overall for NOAA in fiscal 2026, a decrease of about 27% from the current budget.

The fiscal 2026 House and Senate appropriations bills would give the agency more money than Trump’s recommendation, but that funding is unlikely to materialize with Congress poised to enact another continuing resolution when it returns in September.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/73bae58/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F64%2F7803fa0d4d00bf9acef619262d90%2Fflood-photo.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 15:03:55.239631

That’s according to TikTok user Amanda (@themanidiway), who says that the United States’s scheduled dissolution of the $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit on Sept. 30, 2025, could result in big savings.
Chase Auto Finance indicates that this applies to the $4,000 tax credit on used EVs as well.
Furthermore, the TikToker recommends bringing up the fact that you know these tax incentives are going the way of the Fisker Pear.
Which could be the case, especially for lease deals that roll in federal EV tax incentives.","If you’re looking to purchase a new electric vehicle, don’t shy away from haggling. That’s according to TikTok user Amanda (@themanidiway), who says that the United States’s scheduled dissolution of the $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit on Sept. 30, 2025, could result in big savings. Chase Auto Finance indicates that this applies to the $4,000 tax credit on used EVs as well.

So how will this affect EV sales and give prospective vehicular negotiators the upper hand? Amanda breaks it down in her clip. She contends that the removal of this incentive will more than likely make EV costs “extremely unaffordable” for many drivers. Amanda goes on to speculate that removing these incentives will impact consumer trends and that dealers will carry fewer electric vehicles. Consequently, she says that dealerships are now “willing to take a loss on these vehicles just to get them off their lot.”

That’s because the $7,500 and $4,000 tax breaks, while still available, might influence more drivers to purchase an EV. However, since the effective costs of these vehicles will go up once these incentives disappear, Amanda contends that dealerships will be left with inventories of higher-priced EVs.

EV Lease Deals: $7,500 Incentives Rolled In

Amanda also asserts in her video that these tax incentives are particularly alluring for those looking to lease due to discounts being instantly factored into their monthly car notes. Consequently, there have been some eye-popping deals offered to drivers. For instance, Colorado commuters were able to snatch up a Fiat 500e with zero down and a zero-dollar monthly payment. As long as you were a resident of the Centennial State, paid for sales tax, insurance, and registration fees, the ride was yours for no additional monthly costs for the duration of the lease. Well, as long as you had a credit score of 700 or more.

Other lease deals, while not as tempting as $0/monthly, seem to have enticed buyers interested in electric vehicles as well. The Honda Prologue’s success has proven this is the case, as it is one of the most affordable offerings in the Japanese automaker’s lineup. But this success may be short-lived as lease prices have more than doubled between its 2024 and 2025 variants. For instance, the 2024 Prologue AWD EX could be had for $239 a month with $3,199 down, but the 2025 model of the same trim level shoots up to $599 per month. Moreover, the down payment cost skyrocketed: Folks are expected to shell out $4,299 at signing.

Others Echo Her EV Urgings

Bloomberg has also stated that leasing an electric vehicle before the incentives are taken away could be a smart financial decision for folks cruising for a new ride. “Before federal incentives expire, EV makers are rushing to grab customers with affordable leasing deals,” the outlet said.

These savings can even be applied to swankier options, like the Mercedes-Benz EQB. Despite its $53,000 price tag, consumers can nab it for $352 a month, according to Bloomberg. InsideEVs has also listed the EQB as a lease deal worth scoping out, but it should be noted that this is for the 2024 version of the car. And if you’re a fan of Hyundai’s EV lineup, you might be intrigued by the 2025 Ioniq 6’s $4,000 down, $169/month offer. It should be noted that this is for a 24-month term.

If owning a vehicle is more your thing, who’s to say you can’t pursue a lease-to-own option down the road, too? If what Amanda says is true, you might be able to negotiate a decent buyout price once your lease’s term expires and the tax credit has gone away.

Furthermore, the TikToker recommends bringing up the fact that you know these tax incentives are going the way of the Fisker Pear. She suggests that doing so could help drive down the cost of an EV. Which could be the case, especially for lease deals that roll in federal EV tax incentives. She said that she utilized this tactic “to [her] advantage, and it definitely worked.”

Via email, Amanda told InsideEVs that her vehicle is an Audi A6 e-tron premium plus with the all-weather package. She said she negotiated $22,000 off the vehicle.

Clean energy developer Onyx Renewables has wrapped up construction on two 13 megawatt ground-mount solar projects. The solar arrays are scheduled to come online this fall.

Despite Republican opposition to solar, the Army recognizes its benefits. Developed in partnership with sustainable infrastructure company Corvias, the project at Fort Polk (formerly Fort Johnson) is part of a push to help the Army cut energy costs and improve resiliency. The solar systems are designed to deliver stable electricity prices for the base under a 25-year power purchase agreement – and in their first year, they’re projected to meet 40% of the electricity needs for on-base housing.

Fort Polk’s solar arrays sit on 97 acres and will be financed, owned, and operated long-term by Onyx. Battery storage and microgrid tech will also be added later to help strengthen the base’s energy independence.

“By increasing onsite energy capacity with distributed resources, we are not only bolstering crucial resilience across the base but also generating savings that will benefit the military community stationed there,” said Kevin Cox, SVP of Origination at Onyx.

Community solar is meant to provide solar access to individuals and firms that are unable to access rooftop and other solar systems because they rent, occupy a multi-unit building, or lack roofs that can host a solar system.
Some experts have urged the state to pursue storage projects because they come online faster than other types of generation.
Some storage projects have been stood up in less than two years.
Officials have approved bill credits and deferred a portion of some electricity bills to ease the impact of rate hikes.","Gov. Phil Murphy signed two bills meant to boost renewable energy generation in New Jersey on Friday, as tightening supply and surging demand push electricity prices to record levels with even more hikes on the horizon.

The first bill allows state energy regulators to register an additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar capacity, while the other would create an incentive program to stand up 1,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2030.

“Today, there are roughly 650,000 homes throughout the Garden State that are powered by solar energy. With these bills, we’re going to increase that number to 1 million homes by 2028,” Murphy said during a bill signing at a union hall in Lawrenceville. “That’s an increase of over 50% in just three years. That means cheaper, cleaner energy for tens of thousands of New Jerseyans at a faster pace than ever before.”

Democratic and labor officials praised the expansion of community solar, which allows homeowners and businesses to invest in nearby small-scale solar farms to receive credits on their power bills.

Community solar is meant to provide solar access to individuals and firms that are unable to access rooftop and other solar systems because they rent, occupy a multi-unit building, or lack roofs that can host a solar system.

New Jersey’s solar capacity has more than doubled under Murphy’s two terms as governor, rising from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts, and its boosters said community solar delivers guaranteed savings for those enrolled.

“Over 28,000 New Jersey residents are subscribed and are saving money through the community solar program due to the guaranteed bill savings of at least 15%,” said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.

The state’s foray into battery storage would be its first, and New Jersey officials are hoping to make the state a leader in the field. Though battery storage plants do not generate electricity themselves, they can store power generated at points of low demand and release it when demand is high, easing price peaks.

To apply for the incentives, storage projects must have a completed interconnection agreement, or developers must have conducted certain interconnection studies with PJM, the states’ grid operator, and be expected to be operational by Dec. 31, 2030.

Eligible plants could receive up to $10 million in incentives, at a rate of $100,000 per megawatt. Those awards would be paid over 15 years, with the first payment due only after a project becomes operational.

Some experts have urged the state to pursue storage projects because they come online faster than other types of generation. Nuclear plants, for example, can take a decade to build. Some storage projects have been stood up in less than two years.

Incentives would initially be funded by $60 million in revenue from the state’s societal benefits charge, a roughly 3% surcharge on energy bills used to fund energy assistance, clean energy, and social programs, among other things.

“This money is not money that’s being added to the rates of ratepayers. You don’t want the solution to be part of the aggravation to our citizens,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the storage bill’s prime Senate sponsor.

The push for new generation comes as New Jersey and the 12 other states on PJM’s grid, along with others throughout the country, see surges in electricity prices driven mostly by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth electricity demands. Officials have approved bill credits and deferred a portion of some electricity bills to ease the impact of rate hikes.

Democratic officials have blamed PJM for being too slow to connect renewable projects to its grid, while Republicans have charged Murphy’s wind-heavy energy agenda is to blame.

Among other things, PJM’s rules prioritize projects with higher effective load-carrying capacity, a generation type’s ability to produce electricity at times of peak demand. Because they cannot operate at night and in adverse weather conditions, solar projects have by far the lowest rating on that scale — 8% for fixed-tilt and 11% for tracking solar, compared to 50% to 70% for storage projects and 60% to 78% for various gas types of plants.

The state’s offshore wind projects are stalled or abandoned after adverse economic conditions and a hostile regulatory posture at the federal level that has seen offshore wind leases and permits paused or withdrawn.

The federal government’s resistance to renewables could stall the investments officials hope the bills signed Friday would spur.

Provisions in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act require renewable projects to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by Dec. 31, 2027, to be eligible for two types of tax credits, one that pays a fixed amount for electricity generated and another that offsets capital investments for some projects.

The federal bill also made changes to program rules that will make it more difficult for projects that meet the time bar to qualify for credits.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3N2A6964-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 19:04:53.600096

Kovarik continued, “EPA’s announcement conflicts with its consistent finding that small refiners are not facing disproportionate economic hardships from RFS compliance.
We urge EPA to ensure that small refinery exemptions do not undermine the market for farmers and clean fuel producers.” Also, the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) thanked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for addressing the backlog of Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions the current administration inherited.","WASHINGTON — On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it is moving to resolve a years-long backlog of Small Refinery Exemption petitions under the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal program requiring refiners to blend a minimum volume of renewable fuels into the nation’s fuel supply. The agency announced it has acted on 175 petitions filed by 38 small refineries covering compliance years 2016 through 2024. (Read more on the move here.)

More industry groups are sharing their reaction to the news. American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE) CEO Brian Jennings issued the following statement after today’s announcement:

“EPA appears to be carefully trying to balance the recent caselaw and the RFS statute when it comes to their new methodology for small refinery exemptions. The good news is that EPA is proposing to reallocate any and all small refinery exemptions they grant for 2023 and beyond, which is how the SRE program should be implemented. EPA will issue a supplemental proposal on how they intend to reallocate exempted gallons for 2023 and beyond, and their reallocation methodology will be incorporated into the final ‘Set 2’ rule later this year which also covers the 2026 and 2027 renewable volume obligations.

“The Agency argues they’re not going to reallocate for exempted gallons granted to small refineries for the 2016 through 2022 RFS compliance years because those RINs are expired and it will not have an impact on blending. That may be true, and we will carefully monitor how the D6 RIN market reacts to this news. In the past, SREs led to depressed RIN values which discourages blending of E15 and higher blends. Overall, however, the approach proposed by EPA looks reasonable.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America has begun carefully evaluating EPA’s grant to 38 small refineries of full or partial exemptions from compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standards for 2016-2024. EPA announced a new framework for granting small refinery exemption petitions and applied it to more than 175 pending petitions, including previously denied petitions.

Clean Fuels expressed wariness of the agency’s award to the refiners of more than 1.4 billion Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) from compliance years 2023 and 2024 to be used for the delayed compliance deadline for 2024. EPA indicated it will propose a supplemental rule in the coming month to consider reallocating the associated RIN gallons and address the impact on the recently proposed 2026-2027 RFS volumes. Clean Fuels looks forward to working with EPA to quickly finalize this proposal, which will delay the finalization of the 2026 and 2027 rule.

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels’ Vice President of Federal Affairs, stated, “EPA’s course correction on RFS small refinery exemptions creates fresh uncertainty for America’s farmers and biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF producers. We look forward to working with the agency to ensure today’s decision does not unwind the strong signal of support issued in June through robust RFS volumes meant to drive growth and recognize investment in domestic fuels and American agriculture.”

In the recently proposed Renewable Fuel Standards for 2026 and 2027 and Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis, EPA reiterated that its analyses consistently show “all obligated parties—including small refiners—fully recover the costs of RFS compliance” through fuel sales.

Kovarik continued, “EPA’s announcement conflicts with its consistent finding that small refiners are not facing disproportionate economic hardships from RFS compliance. Refunding retired RINs has the potential to undercut current markets for domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF as well as for American oilseed crops and other feedstocks. This announcement comes just as farmers begin planning to harvest the year’s soybean crop, which is expected to achieve a record-setting yield. We urge EPA to ensure that small refinery exemptions do not undermine the market for farmers and clean fuel producers.”

Also, the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) thanked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for addressing the backlog of Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions the current administration inherited. By taking a measured approach to resolving these petitions, EPA now has the opportunity to finalize Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) that can provide greater stability and predictability for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) at a critical time for farmers and processors.

“The EPA inherited a messy situation and we appreciate the agency’s commitment to ending the years-long SRE litigation and restoring stability to the RFS,” said Devin Mogler, President and CEO of NOPA. “NOPA is confident the agency understands that strong RVOs will have profoundly positive impacts on U.S. farmers and rural America. We urge the EPA to build on this progress and quickly finalize the RVOs in a way that delivers these positive impacts, by finalizing a re-allocation policy that fully accounts for gallons lost due to SREs in 2023-2025 and any projected SREs for future years, expanding volumes for the biomass-based diesel category to at least 5.25 billion gallons and ensuring domestic feedstocks and fuels are prioritized. These measures are essential to ensuring the program strengthens domestic markets and keeps investment and jobs in rural America.”

NOPA will continue to engage with EPA and other stakeholders as they work to finalize the RVOs and supplemental rule to ensure they deliver much needed certainty and lasting benefits for U.S. agriculture. The RFS remains a critical tool for advancing U.S. energy dominance while supporting American farmers and rural manufacturing jobs.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2470/2023/09/20221500/RFS-EPA-844x563.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 18:03:46.159796

While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.
Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025.","Solar is set to account for half of new electricity added to the grid in the United States this year, according to predictions from the Energy Information Administration.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.

Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.

In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half.

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.

Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.

Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers, according to Nevada Current.

Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.

On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”

A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation.

Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed.

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement.

One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.

“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote.

In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA.

While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.

Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.

Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA.

In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled.

If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.","https://www.rgj.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/01/31/PREN/78091612007-getty-images-2190964939.jpg?crop=775,435,x0,y0&width=775&height=435&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-22 15:03:50.802264

From the July / August 2025 Issue

When manufacturers embark on a site selection process for a new facility, the stakes are high. Location determines everything from supply chain efficiency to long-term operational costs, workforce availability, and regulatory exposure. For manufacturers seeking to align with sustainability goals and reduce long-term energy costs, access to renewable energy is an increasingly critical factor. Integrating renewable energy considerations into the site selection process introduces a new layer of complexity—but also opportunity. Below are key considerations manufacturers should weigh when selecting a site, with a focus on renewable energy access.

Energy Infrastructure and Availability

At the core of any manufacturing operation is access to reliable, affordable energy. For companies prioritizing renewables, this means examining the availability of green power in the region. Critical questions may include:

Is renewable energy currently being generated nearby (e.g., solar farms, wind turbines, hydroelectric plants)?

Are local utilities offering green power purchase agreements (PPAs) or renewable energy certificates (RECs)?

Does the regional grid include a high percentage of renewables?

Policy Environment and Incentives

Government policy can significantly influence renewable energy access and affordability. At both the state and local level, incentive programs can reduce the capital expenditure required to establish onsite generation, such as solar or wind.

Manufacturers should evaluate these areas of opportunity:

State Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS): These mandate a certain percentage of electricity to come from renewable sources, often creating stronger markets and infrastructure for green energy.

Tax incentives: Federal investment tax credits (ITC), production tax credits (PTC), and state-specific incentives can offset installation costs for solar panels, battery storage, or wind turbines.

Grants and rebates: Some economic development agencies offer financial assistance or expedited permitting for projects incorporating renewables.

Net metering and grid interconnection policies: These determine how surplus energy can be sold back to the grid and can dramatically affect the ROI on renewable investments.

Depending on company preferences and goals, more aggressive renewable energy policies can make an otherwise marginal site a top contender, and vice versa.

Climate and Natural Resources

The natural environment plays a direct role in renewable potential. Solar irradiance, wind speed, and hydrological conditions determine the viability of on-site generation.

Solar energy: Desert regions and southern states generally have higher solar potential. However, this is not always the case. Climate may affect solar panel performance, for example.

Wind energy: The Great Plains, coastal regions, and mountain passes often offer optimal wind conditions for turbine placement. Again, this requires evaluation of specific locations of interest.

Hydropower: Access to flowing water may support micro-hydro or traditional hydroelectric generation, though environmental regulations often limit feasibility.

Geographic factors should be considered not only for energy potential but for long-term climate resilience—droughts, hurricanes, and wildfires can disrupt energy supplies and facility operations.

Utility Relationships and Grid Access

Having a proactive relationship with the local utility provider is essential, especially when a manufacturer wishes to integrate renewables into the energy mix. Site selection teams will want to inquire:

Is the utility open to customized renewable energy deals, such as sleeved PPAs or virtual PPAs?

Can the facility interconnect with the grid easily to import and export electricity?

Does the utility offer time-of-use pricing or demand response programs that can be paired with renewable generation and battery storage?

A flexible, renewable-forward utility partner can be a major advantage for manufacturers seeking to decarbonize.

Land Availability and Zoning

Siting a renewable-enabled facility may require more land than a conventional plant, particularly if the company intends to install large solar arrays or wind turbines.

Zoning regulations must permit both the manufacturing use and renewable infrastructure.

Proximity to transmission lines is especially important if the company plans to sell power back to the grid or needs to draw significant energy from offsite renewables.

Land use constraints such as protected habitats, floodplains, or historical preservation areas can limit development options.

A thorough land assessment can help determine whether a site has the physical capacity for current and future energy needs.

Workforce and Community Engagement

Sustainable manufacturing isn’t just about clean energy—it’s also about creating economic and social value. A region’s workforce must be capable of supporting both high-tech manufacturing operations and, where relevant, the installation and maintenance of renewable infrastructure.

Is there a trained labor pool for green construction, solar PV installation, or energy system maintenance?

Are there technical colleges or universities producing talent in relevant disciplines like environmental engineering, renewable energy systems, or automation?

Is the community supportive of clean energy development, or are there political or social barriers to adoption?

Being a good neighbor is especially important for large-scale energy projects. Early community engagement can ensure smoother permitting and stronger local partnerships.

Long-Term Sustainability and ESG Goals

More manufacturers are aligning their operations with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards. Site selection plays a central role in ESG performance, especially in terms of emissions, resource efficiency, and community impact.

A comprehensive site selection strategy should consider not just immediate energy access but how well the location supports the company’s overall ESG vision.

Resilience and Redundancy

Renewable energy sources can enhance grid resilience, especially when paired with energy storage or microgrid technology. In an age of climate disruption, power reliability is paramount.

Can the facility incorporate battery storage or backup renewables to maintain operations during grid outages?

Are there multiple sources of renewable energy that can be integrated to reduce dependency on a single energy type?

Are local energy systems hardened against extreme weather events?

Redundancy planning helps ensure that a manufacturer’s green energy strategy also supports uninterrupted operations.

Carbon Accounting and Reporting

Many manufacturers are participating in carbon reporting frameworks, such as the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), CDP, or even regulatory disclosures in the EU or U.S.

Sites with grid-supplied renewables can offer scope 2 emissions reductions that count toward corporate targets.

Locations that allow for direct procurement of renewables, including behind-the-meter generation, may provide additional flexibility and traceability for carbon accounting.

The ability to verify energy sourcing is crucial, particularly for reporting purposes and investor communications, and companies pay attention to that factor often.

Selecting a site that facilitates accurate, auditable carbon tracking is increasingly important for major manufacturers.

Green Energy Goals

Site selection is no longer just about transportation costs and labor availability—it’s about energy strategy, sustainability, and long-term value.

For manufacturers prioritizing access to renewable energy, the ideal site must offer more than just geographic advantages. It should enable renewable procurement or generation, align with policy incentives, support resilient operations, and help the company meet its ESG goals.

By integrating renewable energy considerations into the earliest stages of the site selection process, manufacturers can maximize the opportunity to secure a competitive advantage, reduce their environmental impact, and build facilities that are prepared for the energy landscape of the future.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/adobestock_vanessa_green-energy_web.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 15:03:41.102874

Community solar is meant to provide solar access to individuals and firms that are unable to access rooftop and other solar systems because they rent, occupy a multi-unit building, or lack roofs that can host a solar system.
New Jersey’s solar capacity has more than doubled under Murphy’s two terms as governor, rising from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts, and its boosters said community solar delivers guaranteed savings for those enrolled.
Some experts have urged the state to pursue storage projects because they come online faster than other types of generation.
Officials have approved bill credits and deferred a portion of some electricity bills to ease the impact of rate hikes.","Gov. Phil Murphy signed two bills meant to boost renewable energy generation in New Jersey on Friday, as tightening supply and surging demand push electricity prices to record levels with even more hikes on the horizon.

The first bill allows state energy regulators to register an additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar capacity, while the other would create an incentive program to stand up 1,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2030.

“Today, there are roughly 650,000 homes throughout the Garden State that are powered by solar energy. With these bills, we’re going to increase that number to 1 million homes by 2028,” Murphy said during a bill signing at a union hall in Lawrenceville. “That’s an increase of over 50% in just three years. That means cheaper, cleaner energy for tens of thousands of New Jerseyans at a faster pace than ever before.”

Democratic and labor officials praised the expansion of community solar, which allows homeowners and businesses to invest in nearby small-scale solar farms to receive credits on their power bills.

Community solar is meant to provide solar access to individuals and firms that are unable to access rooftop and other solar systems because they rent, occupy a multi-unit building, or lack roofs that can host a solar system.

New Jersey’s solar capacity has more than doubled under Murphy’s two terms as governor, rising from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts, and its boosters said community solar delivers guaranteed savings for those enrolled.

“Over 28,000 New Jersey residents are subscribed and are saving money through the community solar program due to the guaranteed bill savings of at least 15%,” said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.

The state’s foray into battery storage would be its first, and New Jersey officials are hoping to make the state a leader in the field. Though battery storage plants do not generate electricity themselves, they can store power generated at points of low demand and release it when demand is high, easing price peaks.

To apply for the incentives, storage projects must have a completed interconnection agreement, or developers must have conducted certain interconnection studies with PJM, the states’ grid operator, and be expected to be operational by Dec. 31, 2030.

Eligible plants could receive up to $10 million in incentives, at a rate of $100,000 per megawatt. Those awards would be paid over 15 years, with the first payment due only after a project becomes operational.

Some experts have urged the state to pursue storage projects because they come online faster than other types of generation. Nuclear plants, for example, can take a decade to build. Some storage projects have been stood up in less than two years.

Incentives would initially be funded by $60 million in revenue from the state’s societal benefits charge, a roughly 3% surcharge on energy bills used to fund energy assistance, clean energy, and social programs, among other things.

“This money is not money that’s being added to the rates of ratepayers. You don’t want the solution to be part of the aggravation to our citizens,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the storage bill’s prime Senate sponsor.

The push for new generation comes as New Jersey and the 12 other states on PJM’s grid, along with others throughout the country, see surges in electricity prices driven mostly by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth electricity demands. Officials have approved bill credits and deferred a portion of some electricity bills to ease the impact of rate hikes.

Democratic officials have blamed PJM for being too slow to connect renewable projects to its grid, while Republicans have charged Murphy’s wind-heavy energy agenda is to blame.

Among other things, PJM’s rules prioritize projects with higher effective load-carrying capacity, a generation type’s ability to produce electricity at times of peak demand. Because they cannot operate at night and in adverse weather conditions, solar projects have by far the lowest rating on that scale — 8% for fixed-tilt and 11% for tracking solar, compared to 50% to 70% for storage projects and 60% to 78% for various gas types of plants.

The state’s offshore wind projects are stalled or abandoned after adverse economic conditions and a hostile regulatory posture at the federal level that has seen offshore wind leases and permits paused or withdrawn.

The federal government’s resistance to renewables could stall the investments officials hope the bills signed Friday would spur.

Provisions in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act require renewable projects to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by Dec. 31, 2027, to be eligible for two types of tax credits, one that pays a fixed amount for electricity generated and another that offsets capital investments for some projects.

The federal bill also made changes to program rules that will make it more difficult for projects that meet the time bar to qualify for credits.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-92/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3n2a6964-1-1024x6831755884102.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=uLOZw8b_,N,,2025-08-22 21:04:55.640329

August 22, 2025

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR) to cut red tape on the temporary-use Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators (CISWI) for natural disaster debris removal, providing state, local and Tribal governments with the ability to quickly and effectively clean up their communities. Debris left untouched contributes to poor air, land, and water quality and endangers lives. In 2024, in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the Biden-Harris Administration did not grant North Carolina’s request to use CISWI to accelerate clean up citing the lack of temporary provisions for CISWI. In responding directly to states’ request for more incinerators for disaster clean up, the Trump Administration recognizes the importance of temporary-use CISWI.

The IFR will allow the burning of non-hazardous debris using CISWI on a temporary basis during disasters and emergencies. Currently, only Other Solid Waste Incinerators (OSWI) are authorized to combust debris from a disaster or emergency on a temporary basis without having to comply with Clean Air Act (CAA) section 129 requirements. This IFR will aid in response to a wide range of disasters and emergencies, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, ice storms, high winds or acts of bioterrorism.

“Since day one, President Trump has laid out ambitious timelines for clean ups in the wake of natural disasters. While EPA has met those timelines in record times, we are always looking at ways to improve and get out of the way,” said Administrator Zeldin. “With this action, EPA is giving state, local, and tribal leaders flexibility to take necessary steps to quickly and effectively respond to and recover from natural disasters.”

EPA is now authorizing temporary-use provisions for incinerators and Air Curtain Incinerators (ACI) subject to CISWI regulations. These temporary-use provisions authorize the combustion of non-hazardous debris from a disaster or emergency for up to eight weeks without EPA approval. CISWI are required to continue to run existing pollution control equipment, so emissions changes are projected to be zero. The rule allows the use of CISWI units for an additional eight weeks or longer with EPA approval. Due to necessary immediate relief, EPA finds good cause to make this rule effective upon publication in the Federal Register. EPA will take public comments for 45 days on the IFR.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 14:04:55.550391

“To date, 1.5 percent of all nuclear power plants ever built have melted down to some degree,” writes the nonprofit org One Earth.
“The film follows young advocates and business leaders as they advocate for the expansion of nuclear power in America, where energy demand is surging due to factors including the construction of AI data centers,” notes a synopsis.
“For years, I was opposed to nuclear energy, but I couldn’t fully explain why,” the filmmaker said in a statement.
“After I was approached to make this film and began to seriously explore the issues, my perspective changed.","EXCLUSIVE: Nuclear power has plenty of critics – those who point to the cost of building plants, environmental harm from mining uranium for nuclear fission, but most of all safety concerns.

“To date, 1.5 percent of all nuclear power plants ever built have melted down to some degree,” writes the nonprofit org One Earth. “Meltdowns have been either catastrophic (Chernobyl, Ukraine in 1986; three reactors at Fukushima Dai-ichi, Japan in 2011) or damaging (Three-Mile Island in 1979; Saint-Laurent France in 1980).”

But the new documentary The Nuclear Future argues nuclear is the solution to this country’s rapidly expanding energy needs – demands fueled in part by the sudden expansion of AI, which requires tremendous amounts of electricity for data centers. The film, premiering September 15 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, is directed by award-winning filmmaker Evan Mascagni (Building a Bridge, Circle of Poison) and narrated by actor Boyd Holbrook (Narcos, Logan). After the Kennedy Center premiere, the documentary will go on a nine-state tour of 14 college campuses, “where cutting-edge research is underway and future scientists and engineers are currently studying.”

Watch the trailer for The Nuclear Future below.

“The film follows young advocates and business leaders as they advocate for the expansion of nuclear power in America, where energy demand is surging due to factors including the construction of AI data centers,” notes a synopsis. “The added demand has raised questions about the reliability of America’s existing electric grid to support such increases. The advocates must overcome the power source’s controversial past, as they tackle policy and financial challenges to unlock its transformative potential as a clean baseload energy source.

“The Nuclear Frontier offers a rare, behind-the-scenes look at how industry, technology and policy are converging to shape America’s next energy chapter, particularly as the country competes against China for leadership in nuclear’s zero-carbon technology. The United States has built just two nuclear reactors in the past 30 years, while China has built 37 in just 10 years and has another 30 under construction.”

According to a release, the documentary was filmed at locations including Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California, the University of South Carolina, and Washington DC “that help tell the story of the movement toward more nuclear power.”

Director Evan Mascagni is a convert to the pro-nuclear cause.

“For years, I was opposed to nuclear energy, but I couldn’t fully explain why,” the filmmaker said in a statement. “After I was approached to make this film and began to seriously explore the issues, my perspective changed. I came to realize that embracing nuclear energy, along with wind and solar, may be one of the most effective ways to give my daughter and her generation a real chance at inheriting a planet that hasn’t been devastated by climate change.”

The EPA said Friday it is clearing a backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption petitions covering compliance years 2016 through 2024, in a move officials say will put the Renewable Fuel Standard program “back on track.”

EPA granted 63 full exemptions, 77 partial exemptions, denied 28 petitions, and found seven ineligible, according to the agency. The petitions came from 38 small refineries nationwide.

EPA said the decisions were made after consultations with the Department of Energy and a review of refinery-specific information, consistent with the Clean Air Act and federal case law.

Policy Reaffirmed

The agency also reaffirmed a policy established during the Trump administration to grant partial relief — typically a 50 percent exemption — when a small refinery demonstrates partial hardship. That approach differs from the DOE’s 2011 study, which would have denied exemptions even to facilities facing limited hardship.

“Some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others, and EPA’s relief should reflect those differences,” the agency said in a statement.

Compliance Credits and Biofuel Supply

EPA also confirmed that when exemptions are granted for prior years, refiners can reclaim Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) previously retired for compliance. However, because RINs have only a two-year life, credits generated in 2022 or earlier cannot be applied toward 2024 or future obligations.

The agency said this means older RINs will not affect the supply available for 2024 and beyond, and the decision is not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

Looking Ahead

EPA plans to send a supplemental proposed rule to the White House Office of Management and Budget soon. That proposal will address how exempted volumes for 2023 and later compliance years should be reallocated. EPA does not plan to revisit exemptions granted from 2016 through 2022.

The forthcoming rule will also outline how EPA intends to project exemptions for 2026 and 2027 as it finalizes annual blending targets. Officials said the goal is to balance economic considerations with the RFS mandate to expand renewable fuel use.

Program Background

The decision follows EPA’s June proposal for RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027, part of its so-called “Set 2” rulemaking. That proposal, strongly backed by the Trump administration, aims to expand the role of homegrown biofuels, support rural economies, and bolster U.S. energy security.

The public comment period on the “Set 2” proposal closed Aug. 8. EPA is now reviewing submissions and said it will accept additional comments once the supplemental rule is published.

Three questions with: Teen inventor Finnegan McGill To honor his German grandfather, Tanque Verde High School senior Finnegan McGill channeled him.","To fall asleep on the hottest nights as a kid in midtown Tucson, Fabiola Bedoya used to soak her pillowcase with water.

The cool pillow helped her slip into sleep, but she would awake in the night, sweating and hot. Her single-parent home could not afford to run the air conditioning at times.

As an adult, Bedoya questioned “Why are there so many inequalities between accessibility and Latino families,” she asked. “ I wondered about my allergies, the heat, and connections between those.”

The relationship between how she grew up, environmental concerns, low-income families and climate change in the desert, Bedoya searched for resources to educate herself.

Now a single parent to a first grader who attends public school here, Bedoya aims to be an example for Lorenzo, age 6. Her mission: Educate parents, caregivers and the wider community as part of Mom’s Clean Air Force, a nonprofit of more than 1.6 million moms, dads and caregivers fighting air pollution and climate change.

The 35-year-old Tucsonan who grew up in the Amphitheater Public Schools, testified at an Environmental Protection Agency hearing this week as the EPA examines stripping the Endangerment Finding — the science-backed basis for regulating climate pollution under the Clean Air Act.

The rollback of the Endangerment Finding, first proclaimed in 2009, would mean the EPA would lose its legal power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and would set the U.S. back decades in the struggle for a livable climate and clean air.

Tucson earned a failing grade in the number of high ozone days and particle pollution from the American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” 2025 report, which is based on EPA data from 2021-2023.

Particle and ozone pollution can hurt human health, especially for those with chronic heart or lung conditions or people who work outdoors, the lung association says.

This is no surprise to Bedoya, who has chronic allergies and cites rising temperatures in Tucson’s heat zones as a possible reason why.

“As a first-time homeowner in a lower-income neighborhood, I see how the urban heat island effect makes things worse. There aren’t enough trees or green spaces to provide relief,” she said during her testimony. “And for many families in trailers with only fans or swamp coolers, the heat is deadly.

“Extreme heat is a silent killer. It causes serious health issues and puts already vulnerable communities at even greater risk,” she said.

In metro Tucson, 55% of K-12 public schools are in extreme urban heat zones — an average of 8 degrees higher than surrounding regions because of heat-absorbing asphalt, buildings and lack of trees, according to data from Climate Central. That’s 53% of Tucson students attending 122 public schools in extreme urban heat zones.

Statewide, the lung association report found 84% of Arizonans live in communities with unsafe levels of at least one pollutant. The national average is 46%. And air quality has forced the closure of a Kyrene district elementary school in Tempe so far this school year.

These vulnerable elementary students inspire Bedoya to mobilize her community. She is educating through Mom’s Air Force and around Southern Arizona “getting people to take action,” she said.

“Sometimes, it’s ‘hey can you sign this petition?’ Or maybe it’s to talk with your neighbor or coworker and ask them if their kids are getting bad allergies or are sick,” she told Arizona Luminaria.

“It’s little things we may not make the connections with the air or the environment,” she said. “You can take small actions to be aware and put pressure on people, calling people in leadership, maybe providing resources for rebates on appliances.”

Bedoya found her voice little-by-little during the pandemic. She worked full time, earned a degree from the University of Arizona in art, and had Lorenzo. By telling her story, she sees others open up and ask for help or become motivated to contact community leaders. Testifying at the EPA hearing this week, Bedoya continues to educate and be an example for others to come forward.

“I’m speaking up for my son, my neighbors, and everyone who deserves a safe, livable future,” she said.

Three questions with: Teen inventor Finnegan McGill

To honor his German grandfather, Tanque Verde High School senior Finnegan McGill channeled him.

For his eighth grade science fair project, Finnegan thought of his grandpa thousands of miles away and how he tracked and logged birds. To help with this endeavor, Finnegan worked in his backyard to invent A-BiRD: Automated Bird Recognition Device — Revolutionizing Ornithological Research for Global Bird Conservation.

The weatherproof box he created and perfected over the last four years can help researchers track bird migration while birds fly and sing overhead. It earned Finnegan a $25,000 Davidson Fellows scholarship, one of 21 given out nationwide to students under 18 this school year.

Also the student body president, Finnegan is pursuing a patent for his device. His college list includes the University of Arizona, Harvard, Cornell and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And although he was all about space as a kid, he is now leaning toward cancer research and possibly medical school, he said.

“I know I’m the bird guy and I really do like birds,” he said, but he spent last summer as a breast cancer research intern at the UA.

“I definitely want to keep with the birds and ornithology part of it as a side hobby too, because I think that’s really important.”

Three questions for Finnegan as we caught up with him during a lunch break this week:

Q: Can you describe your invention? I basically coded a computer with two microphones on it. It’s called a Raspberry Pi, a really small computer and I hooked up two microphones and I had them recording over a long period of time.

The computer will capture the bird songs as birds are singing or flying overhead. The audio signals from these birds are audio waves, which will travel and hit one microphone before the other. It’s not instantaneous. And it’ll have a delay between the microphones and I’ll calculate the delay and then it can tell you the direction of where that bird is. Then I took the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology’s BirdNET analyzer and I integrated that into my project. That’s basically an AI thing that’ll go through the audio and tell you exactly what bird it is.

Q: How do you escape academics and just chill out? Athletics. I love sports. For school, I do cross country, soccer, and track. Then outside of school, I do Korean martial arts and I’ve been doing that for eight years now. … I’ve been playing the piano for five years, but since I started the Southern Arizona Youth Symphony, I’ve been dabbling my way into some percussion instruments and basically doing a whole bunch of drums and symbols and xylophone. It’s actually really fun because it’s something new.

Q: What three words describe you?

Motivated, inclusive, respectful

For the 2022-2023 grant cycles, the program was funded with a combined $10.4 million, to which Santee Cooper contributed an additional $1.56 million. Recent news will see Santee Cooper take these efforts to the next level with the announcement that they’ve secured final grant approval for 14 new projects.

These projects are intended to improve grid infrastructure to reduce the frequency and duration of outages caused by extreme weather, with a focus on disadvantaged communities. Totaling $6.9 million, these grants were made available to South Carolina through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and approved by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

It’s a development that highlights what a true commitment to grid improvements from utilities can look like on multiple levels. The approval highlights what electric grid improvements actually look like, enabling the organization to provide more reliable service and minimize customer downtime. However, it also highlights the importance of creating proposals that enable alignment with multiple stakeholders. Securing DOE approval further highlights how utilities can consider the entire lifecycle of a federal grant project, where milestones can be dependent on one another.

Jimmy Staton, President and CEO of Santee Cooper, mentioned that this approval will help strengthen South Carolina’s electric grid in a big way, but will do so specifically in communities that are most vulnerable to outages. It’s the sort of blueprint for community resilience that utilities from across the United States are exploring in multiple ways.

Also present was the state’s Board of Public Utilities (BPU) president, who talked about addressing high energy costs through SMRs. Elsewhere, U.S. Rep. and leading gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill talked on the campaign trail about the potential for new nuclear.

Sherrill’s comments: During an August 20 event focused on high energy costs in the state, Sherrill laid out her plans for lowering ratepayer burden. After declaring a “state of emergency on utility costs,” Sherril said she would immediately freeze rate hikes for a year and invest in new energy projects.

Those projects include new solar and battery storage alongside “expediting capacity upgrades at our existing nuclear plants and streamlining the modernization of existing natural gas facilities to make them cleaner and more efficient.""

She also promised to eliminate permitting delays and order her attorney general “to take on” both PJM and President Trump in the courts and “force them to end their mismanagement and get new power added to the grid.”

Finally, Sherrill detailed her plans for the development of new nuclear projects. “I’m going to immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity in Salem County. We already have a preapproved site permit.” She also promised to “sit down with neighboring states so that we can act together to drive down the cost of building new nuclear plants.”

In response, Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli released an announcement blaming Democrats for high energy cost and said that he planned to ban offshore wind development and invest in natural gas and nuclear.

Senate testimony: Last week during a joint meeting of the state’s Senate Environment and Energy Committee and the Assembly Environment Committee, New Jersey Board of Public Utilities president Christine Guhl-Sadovy pointed to high, data center–driven demand as the primary cause of the state’s skyrocketing energy costs.

Among other plans, she said that the BPU is looking to nuclear to meet some of that demand, likely in the form of SMRs. When asked if she would like to see the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant reopened, Guhl-Savoy said, “We need more nuclear generation; Oyster Creek is too far along in its decommissioning process to reopen it, but I do think 100 percent we need more nuclear generation.

In response, state Sen. Carmen Amato (R., 9th Dist.) assured that “Lacey Township officials would be welcoming of additional energy facilities,” reminding meeting attendees that the town “already has the distribution system in place.”

Amato then passed the discussion to the current site owner, Holtec International, which was represented at the meeting by CEO Kris Singh and president Kelly Trice. Singh said, “We need to develop nuclear power in the state, nuclear power that will be all manufactured right here in the state.

Rollins issued a memorandum announcing a new policy directive prioritizing land use efficiency when evaluating proposals for power generation projects on National Forest System lands. The Secretary’s Memorandum (PDF, 1.4 MB) underscores USDA’s commitment to strengthening American energy production and reducing reliance on foreign energy sources, like foreign adversary-manufactured solar panels, while protecting our lands for future generations.

The Memorandum instructs the U.S. Forest Service to develop new screening criteria that measure and prioritize the amount of energy produced per acre of land while ensuring projects are consistent with environmental stewardship, multiple-use principles, and economic benefits for rural communities. Projects demonstrating higher land use efficiency, producing more power with less land disturbance, will be prioritized.

“America has the resources and ingenuity to power our future without depending on foreign adversaries. For too long, misguided federal subsidies and policies have pushed unreliable energy projects that waste taxpayer dollars. Those days are over,” said Secretary Rollins. “Under this memorandum, we are putting America first, ensuring that every acre of federally managed land is used wisely, balancing the needs for energy security with our responsibility to safeguard natural resources. We will no longer allow foreign-made solar panels or inefficient energy projects to undermine our national security. We are prioritizing reliable power sources, reducing costs, and preserving more land for recreation, timber, and wildlife for future generations.”

Background

USDA manages approximately 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands in 43 states, much of which could play a vital role in expanding domestic energy production and transmission capacity. Policies that discouraged the use of these lands for power generation in the past increased reliance on intermittent energy sources and limited U.S. energy independence.

By focusing on land use efficiency, USDA will ensure that proposed energy projects maximize output per acre, reduce environmental impacts, and allow more National Forest System lands to remain available for multiple uses, such as outdoor recreation, grazing, timber, watershed protection, and wildlife conservation. Different generation types, including wind, solar, natural gas, and others, require varying amounts of land and have different environmental impacts, making efficiency-based screening a critical tool for balancing economic development with environmental stewardship.

The Memorandum takes effect immediately and directs the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment to oversee implementation.

People, especially the nation’s youth, are rising up to put a stop to the destruction of life on the planet.

The struggle was ramped up when Lee Zeldin, the Trump-appointed EPA head, announced July 29 that the EPA intended to rescind the Endangerment Finding and all greenhouse gas emissions regulations on medium and heavy-duty vehicles. That potentially deadly decision followed EPA staff cuts, slashes to EPA funding, and other deregulatory actions by the Department of Energy that cheered fossil fuel profiteers and cleared the way for polluters.

In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a finding that brought together robust scientific evidence and broad expert consensus that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and drive global warming) endanger public health and welfare. Decades of climate research contributed to this understanding: Greenhouse gases are a danger to human health and welfare because climate change is a danger to human health and welfare.

Much earlier, in 1970, in response to worsening air quality and a growing epidemic of respiratory health problems, the federal government passed the Clean Air Act and established the Environmental Protection Agency. The Clear Air Act obliged the EPA to regulate air pollution in service of public health, limiting noxious air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter—the kinds of substances that cause hazy smog and hurt to breathe in—which can be emitted from many sources, including factories and vehicles.

In other words, the Endangerment Finding gave the EPA the authority to develop and enforce regulations to reduce climate change-causing pollution, such as carbon dioxide emissions, based on the Clean Air Act. While carbon dioxide isn’t noxious per se, the fact that it contributes to climate change makes it a public health hazard that the EPA can regulate.

Zeldin delivered the news of the intent to repeal this essential finding from applying to a trucking facility in Indiana, where he stood shoulder to shoulder with U.S. Energy Secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright, as well as auto industry representatives and Republican lawmakers.

His smug speech attempted to cast doubt on the scientific basis of the Endangerment Finding and minimize the role of greenhouse gases in climate change, twisting the facts to suit the agenda of the powerful fossil fuel and automobile lobbies that back the Trump administration. As head of the EPA, Zeldin is working to undermine its very mission by questioning its authority to regulate to curb climate change—to use science in the service of critical regulations that protect public health and safeguard environmental quality.

Sacrifice public health

In essence, Zeldin’s mission at the EPA is fundamentally anti-working class as he sacrifices public health and progress on climate change for fossil fuel profits that benefit the wealthy.

The elimination of these regulations will mean an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating the global climate crisis and increasing U.S. responsibility for provoking it. This headfirst dive into worsening the ongoing environmental disaster will endanger people’s lives and worsen the quality of life in the U.S. and around the world. Extreme heat waves, unprecedented storms and wildfires, and ecological disruptions will cause widespread suffering.

This MAGA plot to stifle action on climate change and dismantle the agencies that help address it will disproportionately impact working people and marginalized and oppressed groups. People’s World spoke with Danae Ávila-Dickson, a spokesperson for The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate justice movement that has been influential in promoting the Green New Deal.

“I think who’s going to be most affected is working people and people at the frontlines of the climate crisis,” she said. “We’re already going to see those effects directly… the devastation of the Texas floods was made worse by the fact that Donald Trump was both making these rollbacks and cutting funding for agencies like FEMA.”

Historically, the communities on the frontlines of climate catastrophe have been Indigenous groups, Black communities, immigrants, and women. For example, in the United States, neighborhoods and counties with majority Black and Latino populations are far more likely to experience high rates of air pollution, water pollution, or be situated near toxic waste facilities. Ecologically damaging extractive industries, such as mineral mining and oil drilling, are disproportionately located on Indigenous lands.

Gender inequality is also linked to climate vulnerability, with women and girls globally facing worse impacts from climate and ecological disasters. A study released last year by the International Refugee Assistance Project also reveals climate change as a major driver causing people to flee their home countries and seek refuge elsewhere, potentially exposing them to violence and danger from criminal and state forces.

Rescinding the Endangerment Finding and other environmental deregulations are a boon to the fossil fuel industry, who seek solely to maximize its profits and views regulations as an expense and inconvenience. The role of the EPA is to protect people from polluters and help ensure public health and welfare through defending environmental quality. The Trump administration is actively undermining this mission to benefit his industry backers.

It is no accident that Zeldin delivered the news of the intent to repeal the Endangerment Finding while surrounded by auto industry representatives. The finding allows the EPA to regulate motor vehicle emissions, as well as factories and other sources of greenhouse gas pollution. Under Zeldin, however, the new EPA proposal specifically calls for elimination of car and truck regulations, meaning the disappearance of electric vehicle incentives and impunity for automakers to pollute as much as they please.

Zeldin claims that environmental deregulation will lower prices for Americans, bring back auto jobs, and end “$1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American business and families.” Climate experts and advocates point to the immense economic havoc deregulation will cause, both in the short and long term.

Far from saving consumers money or boosting the economy, deregulation will end up being extremely costly. According to a study from the World Economic Forum, climate change costs the world $16 million per hour, mostly in damages caused by extreme weather events. Taking action that will exacerbate climate change will drive these costs even higher.

Economic effects much worse

Ávila-Dickson notes that “it’s clear that the economic impacts of climate change are going to be much much greater than the funding for the EPA or FEMA” needed to help climate-vulnerable communities, “especially as climate disasters get worse and worse.”

These departments use up relatively small portions of the federal budget, especially in relation to the military and immigration enforcement, yet they carry out the crucial work of research, regulation, support, and response to the threats posed by climate change and environmental disasters.

“Investing in climate mitigation, investing in protections for people is going to be less expensive than the cost of these climate disasters,” Ávila-Dickson added, highlighting the need for a more rational and efficient use of government resources. In the age of endangerment, that means spending more to understand, prevent, and mitigate climate change instead of letting the oil and gas industry set policy.

Looking at these developments in the U.S. environment and energy policy from a global perspective illuminates a concerning regression. “What’s also clear in what’s happening globally is that the U.S. is going to get left behind…while other countries are going to be investing in green jobs, in clean energy, in climate action, the U.S. is investing in the profits of the fossil fuel industry,” the Sunrise Movement spokesperson explained.

The uncertainty of the proposed rollbacks going through—and the potential for that decision to be reversed in the future—also provokes economic instability and chaos for companies and industries, leading to job losses and a reversal of economic investment in energy and manufacturing in the US.

In a nutshell, Ávila-Dickson stated, “The rollbacks in clean energy will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country” and stifle progress on any transition to renewable energy, let alone a just one.

Household energy prices are already climbing, even as Trump declares further plans to block renewable energy projects, and a report from the advocacy and research group Climate Power indicates that over 64,000 jobs have already been lost or are in limbo in the clean energy sector.

“Over and over again as we’re seeing Donald Trump roll back environmental regulations or defund projects in the federal government, these actions are becoming more unpopular,” Ávila-Dickson noted.

Indeed, a recent poll from Data for Progress indicates that a majority of U.S. voters agree that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and an even larger majority believes emissions should be regulated. The Sunrise Movement spokesperson also observed that the rollbacks are not only unpopular “with working people across the country who don’t believe these things should be cut, but we’re also starting to see blowback from corporations and others who this would affect economically.”

Gallup polls also show that a majority of Americans, around 60%, believe the US government is not doing enough to protect the environment, and many also observe a decline in environmental quality.

Quick to denounce

Climate experts and environmental justice advocates have been quick to denounce the proposed regulator repeals. The Environmental Protection Network, a group of EPA alumni working to provide expertise and assistance to support environmental efforts and organizations, condemned the proposal to repeal the Endangerment Finding.

In a July 29th statement, an EPN official called the decision “both legally indefensible and morally bankrupt.” The statement further warns that the consequences of this decision will include tens of thousands more premature deaths due to pollution exposure, millions more asthma attacks, and billions of dollars in lost health and climate benefits.

Activists, experts, and organizations have already mobilized to fight back against these actions and preserve federal environmental protections.

Ávila-Dickson explained the Sunrise Movement strategy for a just, sustainable future: “Right now, what Sunrise is doing is we’re trying to build a mass movement of young people that can disrupt business as usual so that we can end big oil and bring down the oligarchy that’s letting Trump hold on to power.”

She further explained that the Trump administration represents a roadblock to climate action, because “they are going to do everything in their power to block that just transition so that their fossil fuel donors can continue to profit.”

A key part of the fightback is working to elect officials who prioritize the environment and the just transition and are not indebted to the fossil fuel industry. It also includes pushing for climate wins at the local and state level–tightening local environmental regulations and passing policy to promote the energy transition, curb pollution, and promote conservation and sustainability.

The swift, ambitious action that we need on climate change will only come from a mass movement of the working class demanding fundamental changes that will safeguard our future.

As Ávila-Dickson describes, “Throughout history, working people across race, religion, and borders have organized to bring down authoritarians and end oligarchs, and that’s been through disrupting business as usual when workers walk off the jobs, when government workers don’t cooperate with Donald Trump.”

The Sunrise Movement’s plan includes building up the student movement in particular to be ready to participate in a mass strike on May 1st, 2028, when UAW locals and other unions are lining up their contract expiration dates.

“And we do believe this could be one of the most impactful waves of action from working people in generations. And we’re very focused on making sure millions of students are ready to join workers in demanding overhaul of our political system so that it’s finally going to work for everyday people,” said Ávila-Dickson.

While some of the EPA’s deregulatory actions have already taken effect since the Trump administration took power, the proposal to repeal the Endangerment Finding is just that: a proposal. Before it goes into effect, the EPA must host several public hearings and receive public comments. Comments must be received on or before September 15, 2025, and can be made here.

On Thursday, Aug. 21, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association shared its views at an Environmental Protection Agency hearing. The EPA is taking public feedback on its plan to withdraw the landmark endangerment finding.

Finalized in 2009, the EPA’s endangerment finding stated that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. It served as the legal basis for strict vehicle emission rules in subsequent years.

In July, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced at a Kenworth dealership that the agency will rescind the endangerment finding. If that happens, it could pull the rug out from under controversial emission rules, including the “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles – Phase 3.” This rule sets strict standards, requiring 25% of sleeper cab tractors to have zero direct emission by 2032.

In formal comments, OOIDA Executive Vice President Lewie Pugh threw support behind the withdrawal of the endangerment finding. He welcomed the rollback of “nearly 20 years of overly burdensome emissions regulations.”

“These rules have put truckers out of work, hurt small-business competitiveness and discouraged owner-operators from purchasing new equipment,” Pugh said.

The Phase 3 regulation is one of those rules. Pugh called it “a blatant attempt to force consumers into purchasing electric vehicles.” He noted concerns about costs, mileage range, battery weight, charging time and availability.

Pugh pointed out OOIDA’s history of persistently warning the federal government about implementing “impractical emissions timelines” without addressing those concerns. In 2018, he discussed the Clean Trucks Plan with EPA leadership, a sign that the agency was willing to work with the trucking industry. Instead, the trucking industry got what would become the Phase 3 rule.

“After a few bumps in the road, it seems like we are getting back on track to meeting those goals that will result in more reliable and affordable new vehicles,” Pugh said. “In turn, this will achieve cleaner air for everyone.”

Earlier this year, Zeldin indicated the EPA would reconsider the Phase 3 truck emission regulation. OOIDA President Todd Spencer has called the rule an “assault on small-business truck drivers.”

“Small-business truckers make up 96% of trucking and could be regulated out of existence if the current standards were to be implemented,” Spencer said. “Mom-and-pop trucking businesses would be suffocated by the sheer cost and operational challenges of effectively mandating zero-emission trucks. Vehicle reliability and affordability are top priorities for OOIDA members, and we have yet to see proof that electric commercial motor vehicles are a practical option for most trucking businesses considering the price tag and lack of charging infrastructure. We commend EPA Administrator Zeldin on his realistic approach to emissions regulations. We will be working with EPA and Congress on a path forward that prioritizes listening to the men and women of the trucking industry.”",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08-22-25-OOIDA-EPA-comments-pic.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 15:03:59.955682

Under the hood is a hybrid powertrain featuring a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder engine.

In Canada, the 2026 Cherokee starts at $42,390.

Jeep officially unveiled the 2026 Cherokee earlier this August at the Conner Center in Detroit, Michigan, the assembly plant that once produced the Dodge Viper.

The reveal is part of Jeep’s plan to introduce four new models in four months. During the event, the brand also teased the upcoming Grand Wagoneer. Updates for the Grand Cherokee are also expected, along with the debut of the Recon.

Within Jeep’s current lineup, the new Cherokee slots between the Compass and Grand Cherokee. It rides on the STLA platform.

A Hybrid-Only Formula for the New Cherokee

Jeep is going all-in with electrification for the sixth-generation Cherokee, taking a page from Toyota’s RAV4 playbook. The 2026 Cherokee comes standard with a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder engine sourced from Stellantis’ European division. It produces 210 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. While Jeep already uses plug-in hybrid technology elsewhere in its lineup, this marks the first time the American brand adopts conventional hybrid tech. The powertrain is mated to an EVT transmission.

During the reveal, Jeep execs made it clear they heard the demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. However, they also acknowledged that many customers still shy away from the complexity of plug-in hybrids or EVs. Accordingly, Jeep has no plans to introduce a plug-in hybrid version of the Cherokee.

Stellantis claims the Cherokee can travel up to 800 km on a full tank of gasoline, with a combined fuel consumption estimate of 6.4 L/100 km. Official NRCan ratings are to follow.

Classic Jeep Looks with Modern Touches

Vince Galante, Jeep’s VP of Global Design, highlighted the Cherokee’s new vertical grille at the unveiling. While not retro per se, it nods to the model’s past. Naturally, the signature seven-slot grille remains. The U-shaped headlights and taillights inspired by jerry cans with an X-pattern are standout features.

Cargo space has grown by 30% compared to the previous generation.

Trail-Ready Version in the Works

Although the 2026 Cherokee comes standard with Jeep Active Drive I 4×4, a rear axle disconnect, and the Selec-Terrain system with four modes (Auto, Sport, Snow, Sand/Mud), Jeep’s Bob Broderdorf confirmed a more capable off-road variant is on the way.

The new Cherokee is rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds.

Starting at $42,390 in Canada

In Canada, base pricing for the 2026 Jeep Cherokee starts at $39,995, or $42,390 including fees. Other trims include the Laredo ($47,390), Limited ($52,390), and Overland ($56,390).

Standard features include a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch infotainment screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and heated front seats.

On the safety front, even the base model includes:

Automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection

Intersection collision avoidance

Blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-path detection

Driver drowsiness detection

Active Driving Assist (Level 2 with adaptive cruise control)

Rear parking assist with automatic rear braking

New Jeep Compass Grows in Size, Adds EV as Global Rollout Begins

Optional features include a dual-pane sunroof, hands-free power liftgate, 360-degree camera, digital rearview mirror, heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, windshield wiper de-icer, curb-view front camera, turn-signal-activated blind spot monitoring, premium audio system, and Alexa Built-In.

Coming Late 2025

The 2026 Jeep Cherokee will arrive at Canadian dealerships by the end of 2025. The Limited and Overland trims will launch first, followed by the base and Laredo versions in early 2026.

The new Cherokee will be built in Toluca, Mexico, while its hybrid powertrain will be assembled at Stellantis’ Dundee, Michigan facility.

In short, the Jeep Cherokee returns for 2026 as a hybrid-only SUV. This move is expected to deliver strong fuel efficiency and appealing performance.",https://motorillustrated.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0261-1500x844.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 16:03:30.272062

Rollins issued a memorandum announcing a new policy directive prioritizing land use efficiency when evaluating proposals for power generation projects on National Forest System lands. The Secretary’s Memorandum (PDF, 1.4 MB) underscores USDA’s commitment to strengthening American energy production and reducing reliance on foreign energy sources, like foreign adversary-manufactured solar panels, while protecting our lands for future generations.

The Memorandum instructs the U.S. Forest Service to develop new screening criteria that measure and prioritize the amount of energy produced per acre of land while ensuring projects are consistent with environmental stewardship, multiple-use principles, and economic benefits for rural communities. Projects demonstrating higher land use efficiency, producing more power with less land disturbance, will be prioritized.

“America has the resources and ingenuity to power our future without depending on foreign adversaries. For too long, misguided federal subsidies and policies have pushed unreliable energy projects that waste taxpayer dollars. Those days are over,” said Secretary Rollins. “Under this memorandum, we are putting America first, ensuring that every acre of federally managed land is used wisely, balancing the needs for energy security with our responsibility to safeguard natural resources. We will no longer allow foreign-made solar panels or inefficient energy projects to undermine our national security. We are prioritizing reliable power sources, reducing costs, and preserving more land for recreation, timber, and wildlife for future generations.”

The USDA manages approximately 193 million acres of national forests and grasslands in 43 states, much of which could play a vital role in expanding domestic energy production and transmission capacity. Policies that discouraged the use of these lands for power generation in the past increased reliance on intermittent energy sources and limited U.S. energy independence.

By focusing on land use efficiency, USDA will ensure that proposed energy projects maximize output per acre, reduce environmental impacts, and allow more National Forest System lands to remain available for multiple uses, such as outdoor recreation, grazing, timber, watershed protection, and wildlife conservation. Different generation types, including wind, solar, natural gas, and others, require varying amounts of land and have different environmental impacts, making efficiency-based screening a critical tool for balancing economic development with environmental stewardship.

The Memorandum takes effect immediately and directs the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment to oversee implementation.

“Accessing this dependable supply will require new pipelines and supporting infrastructure,” said Dennis Degner, CEO of Range Resources, one of the biggest U.S. gas producers with operations in the Marcellus and Utica.","The U.S. is the world’s largest oil and natural gas producer, but many of its best drilling locations have been tapped. While oil production is expected to plateau or fall in coming months, gas remains a bright spot for the industry thanks primarily to the country’s booming exports. U.S. LNG exports are on track to soar from a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2024 to 21.5 bcfd in 2030, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) outlook. U.S. LNG producers are building new terminals to superchill gas to its liquid state for export. They aim to meet booming demand for the fuel worldwide to meet rising energy consumption and as many countries phase out coal-fired power plants.

That is providing robust growth prospects for the nation’s gas production regions. Morgan Stanley projects gas output in the Haynesville shale in Louisiana will soar by 41%, and in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico by 21% from 2024 to 2027. The Marcellus and Utica shales, which span parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, will grow by 9%, according to the Morgan Stanley estimates. U.S. gas producers and investment firms are gearing up for more activity in Haynesville, positioning themselves for the boom in LNG exports boosted by new approvals from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Within a 300-mile radius of our (Haynesville) assets, there (are) more than 12 bcfd of LNG demand under construction to be in service by 2030,” Domenic Dell’Osso, CEO at Expand Energy, the nation’s biggest gas producer, told analysts in July.

Already this year, U.S. energy firm Venture Global LNG has sanctioned the construction of CP2, its third export plant in Louisiana; while rival Cheniere Energy decided to build two additional liquefaction trains at its Corpus Christi plant in Texas. Australian firm Woodside Energy Group said it would move forward with its Louisiana LNG project.

Analysts expect more energy firms to take advantage of Trump’s favorable federal permit policies to build additional LNG export plants and pipelines over the next 12 months. See, Factbox of North American LNG export projects

TRAPPED GAS

Overall, the EIA projects U.S. gas output will climb from a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023 to around 113.5 bcfd in 2030, with most of that fuel going to meet soaring LNG export demand. Canada, meanwhile, will also supply an average of around 7.0 bcfd of pipeline gas to the U.S. over the next five years.

Even with LNG demand rising, the EIA projected total U.S. gas demand, including domestic consumption and exports, would only rise by around 1% per year on average from now through 2030, climbing from a record 111.5 bcfd in 2024 to about 120.3 bcfd in 2030. That slowing growth comes as domestic gas consumption slides from a record 90.5 bcfd in 2024 to around 89.6 bcfd in 2030, due mainly to declines in the amount of gas that power generators burn as renewable output rises. Some other energy analysts, however, expect U.S. power generators will burn more gas in coming years than the EIA forecasts to meet fast-growing demand for electricity from power-hungry data centers.

New pipelines and other infrastructure will be needed to transport the gas to market.

In the U.S. Northeast, capacity to transport gas will likely remain constrained, capping potential output growth there to just about 3 bcfd by the end of the decade unless more pipelines get built, according to East Daily Analytics analyst Jack Weixel.

“Accessing this dependable supply will require new pipelines and supporting infrastructure,” said Dennis Degner, CEO of Range Resources, one of the biggest U.S. gas producers with operations in the Marcellus and Utica. Several U.S. pipeline firms, including Kinder Morgan, Williams Cos and Energy Transfer, have already started to spend billions to build hundreds of miles of new pipe, including in the Northeast, to supply more gas for export and domestic demand.

As their production equipment ages out, U.S. manufacturers are turning to electric heat pumps, boilers and more for long-term cost, sustainability and health reasons. The transition could even save lives, according to a recent report from the American Lung Association.

However, a lapse in federal funding has made it difficult for companies to upgrade to more energy-efficient equipment, experts said during the Future of Manufacturing Decarbonization webinar hosted by Manufacturing Dive on Wednesday.

While state and public-private funding opportunities are still available, the Trump administration’s latest tax bill gutted a number of programs that have provided billions of dollars to finance clean energy projects, including equipment installations and upgrades. It also repealed clean energy tax incentives and rescinded unobligated funds from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants, among other programs.

These federal changes have made the funding landscape more uncertain and challenging for companies to navigate, said Andrew Hoffmeister, a senior research analyst at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

“Those funds are needed at this point to help de-risk the market and to demonstrate the technologies at a greater scale,” Hoffmeister said.

In addition to reduced emissions, there are hidden benefits that manufacturers are weighing prior to adoption. Hoffmeister said some of the “co-benefits” include conserving resources, such as water sent to cooling towers, and reducing costs like insurance, maintenance and permitting.

Manufacturers are weighing these benefits against the costs for new equipment, the process downtime for retrofits, the costs of installing and integrating new technologies and other factors, he said.

If manufacturers upgraded to energy-efficient industrial heat pumps across the nation, it could prevent 77,000 pollution-related deaths and more than 33 million asthma attacks in the coming decades, according to a report from the American Lung Association. States with a high concentration of facilities have the most to gain from such a transition.

In California, one of the largest manufacturing states, more companies are starting to deploy zero-emissions electric heat across their operations, but “we don’t have high enough rates of adoption,” said Teresa Cheng, California director at Industrious Labs.

This is partially due to high barriers of entry. California has some of the highest electric rates in the country, Cheng said, and without clean energy investment, fuel and operational costs will likely continue to increase and deter companies from doing business within the state.

“Regulators really need to be thinking about how to make this as easy as possible for companies who want to make the right investment,” Cheng said.

Although federal funding has been clawed back, there are alternatives. California lawmakers have allocated $68 million to the state’s Industrial Decarbonization and Improvement of Grid Operations program, known as INDIGO, for clean industrial technology investments.

Industrious Labs is also co-sponsoring a bill with Earthjustice that aims to reinvest in INDIGO and enable eligible projects to access low-cost financing through California’s Green Bank, Cheng said. The program guidelines prioritize investments that maximize climate emissions reductions and projects that improve air quality in disadvantaged communities, she added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JCxfsJOGt0jJ-GRAcXFnNCaidBiugnKY1E3QLPbS4Wg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzIwMjUtMDgtMjJfMTEyODI2LnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-22 14:04:03.738252

“Other states in our region and across the nation are seeing electricity prices rise at a significantly larger rate than Evergy.
Evergy also partners with local organizations, including the United Way of St. Joseph, to connect residents with assistance.","ST. JOSEPH, Mo. (News-Press NOW) -- Residential and commercial electricity prices in Missouri are rising, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Annual Electric Power Industry report.

The average price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. A kilowatt-hour is the amount of electricity consumed by a 1,000-watt appliance running for one hour.

In 2016, Missouri residential customers paid an average of 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. By 2024, the figure rose to 12.91 cents. Commercial rates increased from 9.26 cents to 10.29 cents over the same period. Industrial rates had a slight decrease from 7.12 to 7.9 cents.

These increases reflect a growing energy demand.

Evergy serves around 340,000 customers in its Missouri West service area, which includes St. Joseph. More than 50,000 of those customers are in St. Joseph alone.

Despite this trend, Evergy Spokesperson Courtney Lewis said customers in St. Joseph are currently seeing some relief.

""Customers in St. Joseph are seeing their overall prices go down about 5% from June 2024 to June 2025 because of lower fuel costs,"" Lewis said.

Lewis said energy use typically spikes in the summer months due to air conditioning. Evergy’s long-term increases have been smaller than national trends.

“Other states in our region and across the nation are seeing electricity prices rise at a significantly larger rate than Evergy. During that same time period, the average Evergy customer in St. Joseph saw their rates go up about 9.5%, and that’s well below that national increase and well below the rate of inflation.”

Lewis said Evergy works to keep costs low while maintaining reliability.

Some customers, though, are still complaining about high bill prices.

“Do I pay my electric or do I eat?,"" Gypsy said, Evergy customer, ""I’m still not turning on very many lights and its $71.”

Another customer, Barbie said, “For those of us living on a budget like disability or you know. I just think it’s outrageous.”

For customers struggling to keep up with bills, Evergy offers several programs:

Average Pay: spreads payments evenly across the year to avoid seasonal spikes.

Economic Relief Pilot Program: provides up to $65 per month for qualifying households at or below 200% of the federal poverty level.

Energy Crisis Intervention Program: available for households facing disconnection.

“If people need assistance or they need some help with their energy bills, we want people to contact us,"" Lewis said. ""We want you to keep your lights on. Don't wait till it's too late. We have programs available, and we also have resources that we can refer you to, like United Way or other opportunities for assistance.""

Evergy also partners with local organizations, including the United Way of St. Joseph, to connect residents with assistance.

In addition, customers can take advantage of Evergy’s energy analyzer tools to monitor usage and compare their consumption to similar homes. Shifting appliance use to off-peak hours can also reduce costs.

Any rate increases must be approved through the Missouri Public Service Commission, which reviews requests through public hearings and testimony.",https://newspressnow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/67b2d445beff9.webp,N,,2025-08-22 13:09:08.112375

Across the country — and according to official national data from the OFV — Polestar doubled its sales year over year in July.

The figures jumped from 93 to 193 vehicles, despite a drop in registrations month over month. It had registered 774 units in June.

Polestar ranked as the 14th best-selling brand in the country with the largest EV adoption in the world. In July, 97% of the new units registered were battery electric vehicles.

In a new LinkedIn post this Friday, country chief Marius Hayler, who is also the Regional Director for the Nordic Region, wrote that “Polestar stood out in a big way” among brands represented by local dealer ‘Bil i Nord.’

‘Bil i Nord’ represents brands like Volvo, MG, Ford, Subaru, Nissan and XPeng in the North of Norway.

Since the beginning of the year, it has also been the first authorized dealer for Polestar in Tromsø, Finnsnes, Harstad, Sortland, Svolvær, Bodø, Mo i Rana, and Mosjøen.

The premium brand has five showrooms in Norway, including one in the North — in the city of Tromsø.

“Earlier this August, ‘Bil i Nord’ shared their sales results with local newspaper Nord24 – and Polestar stood out in a big way,” Hayler said, adding that “since January, Polestar Spaces in Northern Norway has delivered 101 cars, a 236% increase compared to last year.”

Hayler congratulated sales manager Johan Elias Lakseide, noting that “demand has been “well beyond expectations”, driven by the right design, great range, competitive offers and a strong local presence.”

“Polestar is now among the best-selling models in Northern Norway, competing head-to-head with Tesla, BMW and Volkswagen,” he concluded.

The company, which is headquartered in Sweden, sold 2,667 vehicles last month across eleven out of its thirteen markets in Europe — a 22.2% increase from 2,182 vehicles sold a year ago.

The figures halved (53.7%) from the 5,756 vehicles registered in June, amid the typical end of quarter sales push.

Polestar’s monthly registrations in Europe show sharp fluctuations largely due to the brand’s dependence on manufacturing and shipping cycles in China and the US.

The Polestar 2 has been produced at the Luqiao factory in Zhejiang, China, since 2020. Production of the Polestar 3 SUV is split between Chengdu, China, and Volvo’s plant in South Carolina, US.

The Polestar 4, currently built in Hangzhou Bay, China, is expected to start being produced in Busan, South Korea, later this year.

The new factory will serve the US market, according to the brand. It remains unclear whether vehicles will also be shipped to Europe from there.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is acting on the backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions from 38 small refineries for 2016 – 2024 compliance years. In consultation with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), EPA reviewed and considered information submitted by each petitioning small refinery. EPA then evaluated each SRE petition consistent with the Clean Air Act and case law. After carefully reviewing all information, EPA is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions, and determining 7 petitions to be ineligible.

EPA is reaffirming the policy it set in the first Trump Administration through the 2020 Renewable Volume Obligation Rulemaking, granting partial relief (a 50 percent exemption) where a small refinery has demonstrated that it faces partial hardship. Under DOE’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief despite demonstrating partial hardship. With today’s action, EPA is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences. Concurrent with this decision, EPA will update the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect action on the 175 petitions.

At the same time, EPA is reaffirming a policy to return RFS compliance credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. Under the RFS program, RINs have a two-year window for use, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the following compliance year. Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window. Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

Finally, in the near future, EPA will submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the proposed reallocations of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes. EPA does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016 – 2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use. EPA will also be providing updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today’s actions and projected SREs granted for 2025 – 2027 in Set 2. The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.

Please see EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard program website for more information.

Background

In June, EPA announced a major step forward to strengthen American energy security and support American farmers by proposing RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. This action represents a critical and much-needed step in the evolution of this program. Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA’s “Set 2” proposal ensures the RFS program remains true to Congress’ original intent of increasing the use of homegrown American biofuels, unleashing American energy, and supporting rural economies.

The comment period for the proposed rule closed on August 8, 2025. EPA is currently reviewing the comments submitted on the “Set 2” proposed rule and working on a final regulation. Upon publication of a supplemental proposed rule on potential reallocation of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes, as described above, EPA will accept public comments on this supplemental proposal.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:07:36.755456

The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use.
It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today issued decisions involving 175 petitions for small refinery exemptions (SREs) from the Renewable Fuel Standard for 2016-2024. EPA granted full exemptions to 63 petitions, partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions, and deemed seven ineligible.

While the Renewable Fuels Association continues to question whether these SREs are truly justified, RFA noted that EPA’s approach for implementing these exemptions appears reasonable and should not disrupt the marketplace or reduce actual renewable fuel consumption.

For exempted small refineries who had already fulfilled their RFS obligations for past compliance years, EPA will return the corresponding RINs retired by those small refineries for each compliance year. For all years but 2023 and 2024, those RINs have expired and may not be used to comply with standards that are currently open. EPA also announced its intent to soon propose that exempted volumes for 2023 and beyond be reallocated to ensure that the integrity of already-finalized RFS volumes is maintained. The agency will be accepting public comments on the matter of reallocation for 2023 and beyond.

In response to the EPA announcement, RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper offered the following statement:

“While RFA continues to doubt that the small refineries receiving exemptions today truly experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ due to the RFS, we are pleased to see EPA taking an approach to implementation of these exemptions that is minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs. We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

“In the days ahead, RFA will be further analyzing EPA’s new approach and rationale for determining disproportionate economic hardship. According to EPA’s previous analysis, all refiners—both small and large—recoup their RIN costs when they sell gasoline and diesel. Thus, there is no credible evidence that small refiners are disproportionately affected by RFS compliance, or that the financial impact of RFS compliance rises to a level anywhere close to ‘economic hardship.’ In any case, SREs were always intended to be a temporary measure and a bridge to compliance—not a permanent handout. Small refiners have now had two full decades to adapt their operations to comply with the RFS.”",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/796/1000/EPA-Offices.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:07:43.342829

“In 10 years’ time, La Joya will be the most developed district in southern Peru,” Cuadros claims.","In southern Peru, in a desert that stretches along the coast of the Arequipa region, the sun seems to burn relentlessly. Solar radiation is high here, and there are more hours of sunshine per day than anywhere else in the country. In the district of La Joya, the government has for several years been promoting solar power generation and the creation of the country’s first green hydrogen plant. It’s a challenge that is slowly beginning to take shape.

According to the Solar Energy Atlas of Peru, produced by the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service of Peru (Senamhi), La Joya has the highest solar radiation values in the whole of Peru, with average daily solar energy reaching 7.03 kilowatt hours per square metre. It also has a relative sunshine duration of 75%, a statistic based on the possible and actual hours of sunshine relative to location and time of year.

Elías Huamaní, 46, is the elected president of the Cristo Rey Population Centre, a small settlement of 5,000 in La Joya. He has lived here since he was 16 and tells Dialogue Earth that, in his entire life, he has seen the sky “very rarely cloudy”, adding: “It hardly ever rains.”

“It is an area with a lot of solar radiation, with more than nine hours of sunshine a day and clear skies almost all year round,” José Luis Ticona, a climatology specialist at Senamhi, tells Dialogue Earth.

Huamaní is not surprised when he sees from afar how the desert is filling up with solar panels, but he says no one from the companies or the government has approached the community to talk about these developments.

In another town in La Joya, called San José, community leader Marcos Calcina knows only slightly more about proposed solar projects. He and his association had a public hearing with Acciona Energía Perú, one of the companies that will set up in the area.

“They explained the details of the environmental impact to us. It is the only company that has met with us. They say there are more companies, but we don’t know anything about the rest,” Calcina says. He adds that Acciona told communities the project will be located outside of the town centre, will generate jobs for local people, and that Acciona will also carry out works to improve local services such as schools, roads and health centres.

Notable growth in solar projects

The San Martín solar power plant became the largest in Peru when it began operating in La Joya in early June. The project, by Zelestra, a global renewable energy developer headquartered in Spain, features 450,000 solar panels that will reportedly generate 830 gigawatt hours of clean energy each year. Attending its inauguration on 17 July, Peru’s president Dina Boluarte said the plant will benefit 440,000 families.

However, the first significant solar projects in the country date back more than a decade. In 2012, Spanish company T-Solar built Peru’s first utility-scale photovoltaic power plant in La Joya, installing 55,704 solar panels to generate 22 megawatts of power.

Now, construction is underway on the Illa solar power plant in Arequipa, which will leapfrog the San Martín plant to become the largest in Peru. Ernesto Oliver, spokesperson for the Enhol Group, tells Dialogue Earth that the Spanish company will install more than 742,000 solar panels with a generation capacity of 472 megawatt-peak. This is a unit of measurement unique to solar energy, measuring the cumulative peak capacity of all modules in a solar power plant.

“We are in the middle of the construction phase. The entire plant is expected to be operational by the end of 2026. Arequipa has a high energy demand, particularly from the mining sector,” says Oliver.

There are several more projects with authorisation to begin construction in Arequipa. These include the Misti Continúa solar plant (507,690 panels), the Sunny plant (612,000 panels) and the San José plant (312,648 panels). There are a total of 29 solar farms planned for the region, according to the Supervisory Agency for Investment in Energy and Mining (Osinergmin).

To meet this high demand, the Chinese company JA Solar, one of the world’s leading panel manufacturers, is seeking to become a strategic partner in many of these projects. As confirmed to Dialogue Earth by Cristhian Romero, JA Solar’s sales manager in Peru, two contracts (with the companies Inver Management and Acciona Energía Perú) have been signed worth more than USD 60 million, and by the end of 2026 they will reportedly deliver more than 900,000 modules exceeding 650 megawatts.

“This investment is a milestone for the company in Latin America. The Peruvian market is at a key stage in accelerating the energy transition, and we want to be an active part of that process. Arequipa represents a fundamental axis within our strategy,” says Romero.

Other opportunities

“In the last five years, La Joya has grown by 30% in terms of housing. Seventy percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, 20% works in various companies, and the rest are self-employed,” La Joya’s mayor Christian Cuadros tells Dialogue Earth. The 2017 census reported the district’s population as 35,943 but Cuadros estimates it is now around 66,000.

He believes the interest of foreign entrepreneurs in developing photovoltaic plants in his district will have a positive impact. The local government is working with the Arequipa College of Architects to develop an urban development and zoning plan to define which areas will be for urban growth, agriculture and industrial zones, and where renewable energy resources will be developed.

“In 10 years’ time, La Joya will be the most developed district in southern Peru,” Cuadros claims.

Patricio Lewis, an economist with the Network for Development Studies (Redes), says photovoltaic projects will be able to meet the energy demands of the many upcoming mining investments in Arequipa, such as Tía María, a USD 1.8 billion copper mine, and Zafranal, a USD 1.9 billion copper and gold mine.

Hydrogen on the rise

Peru’s electricity comes from various sources. In 2024, production consisted of 51% hydroelectric, 40% thermal-natural gas, and only 9% from renewable energies (sun, wind, and biomass), according to data from COES, Peru’s energy operating company.

César Butrón Fernández, president of COES, tells Dialogue Earth he expects the renewable energy share of Peru’s total electricity generation to reach 34% within the next 10 years. To achieve this, he says green hydrogen, produced using renewable energies such as solar and wind, could play an important role in Arequipa and the country as a whole.

In this regard, there are two proposals in Arequipa that have generated considerable hopes in the sector. The first is the Horizonte de Verano green hydrogen project by the US company Verano Energy, which has had an environmental impact study approved by the Ministry of Production.

According to the document, this project, which aims to produce up to 85,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year, would begin construction this year and start operating in 2028.

The second project is from the South African company Phelan Green Energy, which has submitted a proposal to the Regional Government of Arequipa (GRA) for both parties to move forward with the project. Phelan’s country manager, Jean Luois Gelot, says the GRA has made 5,000 hectares available for the project in Santa Rita de Siguas district for the solar plant and 50 hectares in the coastal city of Matarani for the hydrogen plant.

“We will enter into a public-private partnership as an active project. The state provides the land and receives compensation. The GRA is not investing a single penny and is not liable if the project fails,” Gelot tells Dialogue Earth. “We have already presented the financial model, which will undergo a technical and economic evaluation by the regional government and then by the regional council.” He confirms the investment will be around USD 2 billion to produce 75,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/08/Power-lines-in-the-La-Joya-desert-southern-Peru_Presidencia-de-Peru_Flickr_cec6d39a68-1200px-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 17:03:26.537889

International Paper, a longtime pillar of Coastal Georgia’s economy, announced Thursday that it will permanently close its Savannah and Riceboro plants by the end of September and cut some 1,100 hourly and salaried jobs.

The closures of the company’s containerboard and packaging facilities in Savannah and its containerboard mill and timber and lumber operation in Riceboro are part of “actions to enhance its ability to serve and grow with customers while improving its manufacturing footprint,” the firm said in a news release.

While eliminating its operations in Savannah and Riceboro, the firm said it will invest $250 million for renovations at its Riverdale mill in Selma, Alabama, to produce container board and sell its global cellulose.

In its press release, the firm, the world’s largest pulp and paper company, said it will shutter its operations in Savannah and Riceboro “in phases by the end of September 2025.”

IP director of communications, Amy Simpson, said there are approximately 700 workers at the Savannah Mill and 100 at the box plant. The Riceboro plant employs about 300.

“We understand how deeply these decisions affect our employees, their loved ones, and the surrounding communities,” said Tom Hamic, executive vice president and president of the company’s North America Packaging Solutions business.

“We are committed to supporting both our employees and customers as we navigate this transition.”

Reactions

The firm’s operations in Savannah and the surrounding area stretch back nearly 88 years. It has employed generations of mill workers, boosting their families and the region’s economy.

In a statement, Savannah Mayor Van Johnson expressed disappointment about the closure and concern for the 650 Savannah-based employees.

“Through seasons of change and challenge, International Paper has emerged to be a great corporate partner to our community,” he said. “As Savannah has always done, we will rise together. By combining our collective talent, wisdom, and resources, we will work to ensure that our neighbors have new opportunities to provide for themselves and their families.”

In Liberty County, county commission chair Donald Lovette was still processing the news on Thursday morning. “”All of a sudden, your life is kind of in limbo. So my heart goes out to all of them, especially those who are near retirement. It’s going to be quite an adjustment for them,” he said.

Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Bert Brantley echoed the emphasis on IP contributions to the city and willingness to work to place workers.

“Our Chamber is devastated to hear the news of International Paper’s decision to close its Savannah and Riceboro mills. IP has long been a terrific employer, engaged corporate citizen, and strong partner of the Chamber. In particular, the local leaders at IP have contributed immensely to the betterment of our community in more ways than we can count. We stand ready to work with our state partners at the Georgia Department of Labor, and our local teams at SEDA and RISE to support the employees as they navigate this next step in their lives.”

The corporate news release omits any mention of the company’s Port Wentworth biomass energy plant. The company operates more than a dozen large paper mills in the U.S.

IP’s Simpson confirmed the Port Wentworth pulp mill will not close but had been sold. “The Port Wentworth pulp mill is not affected by today’s closure announcements but is part of our Global Cellulose Fibers business and is included in the sale of that business to AIP, which was also announced today.”

Liberty County impact

The history of the plant goes back nearly 6 decades in Riceboro. The Interstate Paper Corporation established the Riceboro Paper Mill in 1966, the largest privately owned industry Liberty County had ever had, was established near the North Newport River at Riceboro in 1967. It was the site of the old Montevideo Plantation rice farm.

The plant grew to represent $300 million in economic impact for the county, according to Riceboro Mayor Chris Stacy, a 29-year IP employee. He heard the news after he woke up around noon after working last night’s overnight shift.

State Rep. Al Williams, who is chairman of the Liberty County Development Authority, described news of the closures as “difficult for our community, for our region.”

“My first concern is for the people whose livelihoods are affected, men and women who have given years of hard work and loyalty to these operations,” he said. The mill The mill specialized in producing Kraft linerboard, which contains 25%-30% recycled fiber.

Williams, who also serves as chairman of the Liberty County Development Authority, said the agency had offered “strong incentives for International Paper to stay and invest here. I know the company has not made this decision lightly though we had been working and hoping for a different outcome.

The authority, he said, would “do its best” to coordinate with company leadership to understand the timeline and transition plan and would join with local, regional and state agencies to “stand up support services and programs.”

The authority’s CEO, Brynn Grant, said the agency was moving immediately “to support impacted workers and local businesses in every way we can.”

She said she planned to coordinate with SNF, another Riceboro employer, to help find opportunities for IP workers. “They certainly need people, and these will be people that have a great skill set who can blend into what they do, so we’re looking forward to working with them. She said Workforce Coastal, too, we’re going to work with them, of course Savannah Tech, we’re going to coordinate with them — all the players when it comes to gainful employment.”

Lovette said the county would try to make the process smooth for employees. “About 40% of the employees are from the Liberty County area. The rest of them would be from other areas,” he said. IP was Riceboro’s oldest and second largest employer; SNF is the largest.

A midday check of the Riceboro complex showed operations as usual, with a steady stream of timber trucks entering and leaving the plant. A security officer referred questions to Simpson.

Cars and trucks in the employee parking lot bore license plates not only from Liberty County but also from several surrounding counties: Long, Wayne, McIntosh, Brantley, and Glynn — indicating families throughout Coastal Georgia will be directly impacted by the closures.

“It’s even going to affect your loggers because the Savannah one is closed, Riceboro’s closed … gotta go to I guess Rayonier or either Brunswick, because there’s no more logging in this area,” Stacy said. “It’s going to affect everybody.”

“How do we recover truck drivers, logging company, all those people are affected in that area, you know? I’m really concerned about that,” Stacy said.

Georgia Speaker of the House Jon Burns (R-Newington), a fifth-generation timber farmer, also cited the longer tail of the closures. “I understand firsthand the challenges of facing changing markets and economic instability. These mill closures will undoubtedly deal a devastating blow not only to Georgia’s timber industry, but to the economic fabric of the entire Southeast Georgia region,” Burns said.

Stacy said that the timeline is tight for workers: “Sept. 8 is going to be the last operational [day] of making product, and the gate’s supposed to be locked on Oct. 20.” He said that the company is “doing some negotiation for service pay for some of the people out there” regarding severance. He also said he’d contacted IP with “just some concerns about making sure they get some help out there for the guys to cope with whatever’s going on. Just kind of saying that, in times like that, you’ve just really got to be careful because you don’t know where people’s minds’ (are) at.”

Corporate decision

International Paper employs more than 65,000 people and has operations in more than 30 countries. Its net sales in 2024 were $18.6 billion. In its press release, it said the moves announced Thursday were “part of a series of strategic changes to achieve an advantaged cost position, deliver a superior customer experience and maintain a high relative supply position as part of its ongoing transformation journey.”

Hamic said while “difficult,” the cutbacks in Georgia and investments in Alabama that were announced Thursday were “essential to positioning International Paper for long-term success, enabling us to focus on the geographies, customers, and products where we can create the most value.”

Leaving history

In Liberty County, commission chair Lovette said the county had been working to help IP stay in the county. He said the move would leave a cultural and emotional void.

“I remember people who were able to leave the timbering process, you know? Because Liberty County was primarily agricultural, of course, and timber,” he said. “And when that company came, they gave people a hand up, if you will. People were able to make a good living and provide for their families right from that company.”

In Riceboro, IP’s plant was previously known as Interstate Paper.

“They’ve been there the longest of anybody. Interstate Paper, I still go back to that name, they were the bread and butter for Liberty County for many, many years,” Lovette said. “A lot of our employees have been gainfully employed there. They were able to build homes and send their children to college, and all those kinds of things that made them a major and respected employee here in Liberty County. It’s been Interstate Paper, International Paper … we owe them a debt of gratitude.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250821-100.webp,N,,2025-08-22 13:07:03.955493

The end of the tax credit is currently sparking a wave of orders for most EV makers ahead of the deadline.

In a fact sheet updating frequently asked questions on the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act’ (OBBBA), the IRS said buyers will be treated as having “acquired” a qualifying vehicle if they enter into a binding written contract and make a payment — such as a deposit or trade-in — before September 30.

That means the $7,500 new clean vehicle credit under section 30D, the $4,000 previously owned clean vehicle credit under section 25E, and the $7,500 commercial EV credit under section 45W can still be secured by contract, even if delivery happens after the deadline.

“The credit will not be allowed for any vehicle acquired after September 30, 2025,” the IRS said. “A binding written contract signed on or before September 30, 2025, together with a payment, will establish that acquisition occurred before the termination date.”

Previously, vehicles had to be delivered and placed in service by that date to qualify.

Under the new rules, acquisition secures the credit, while the credit itself can only be claimed once the car is delivered and the dealer provides a time-of-sale report.

The OBBBA, signed into law on July 4, accelerates the phase-out of multiple clean-energy incentives.

Along with the termination of EV credits after September, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit under section 30C will expire June 30, 2026.

Credits for energy-efficient home improvements (section 25C) and residential clean energy (section 25D) will end for expenditures made after December 31, 2025, while the New Energy Efficient Home Credit (section 45L) will terminate for homes acquired after June 30, 2026.

California regulators are weighing whether to step in with state subsidies once the federal credits expire.

Earlier this week, The California Air Resources Board has proposed offering $7,500 credits for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs, but said funding would depend on available state resources.

In June, Trump said that his plans to cut EV tax credits were “not something new” and that he was surprised that Musk was endorsing him.

One, this Trump administration is more filled with partisan players who were prepared to hit the ground running.
New power generation is needed more quickly, and renewables, especially solar power, will still fill most of the short-term gap—with or without tax credits.","A nearby offshore wind farm was already planned when Donald Trump purchased coastal land in northern Scotland to develop the Trump International Golf Links—a project he envisioned as an homage to his Scottish-American mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump.

“I am not thrilled. I want to see the ocean; I do not want to see windmills,” Trump told BBC News in May 2006. It was the first-known example of Trump’s years-long war against wind power.

It took another five years for the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm to initiate permitting and, in 2012 as the golf course was nearing its opening, Trump launched an all-out media and legal assault against the wind project—a campaign that proved unsuccessful. “Tourism will suffer and the beauty of your country is in jeopardy,” Trump warned in a 2012 advertisement.

Trump wrote in a 2013 Daily Mail article that he would fight “for as long as it takes—to hell if I have to—and spend as much as it takes to block this useless and grotesque blot on our heritage.” By the time he was first running for president in 2015, Trump had tweeted negatively about wind or “windmills” more than 130 times.

Much to Trump’s chagrin, the Scottish wind farm opened in 2018. But he’s carried that fight much more aggressively in his second term as U.S. president.

Upon his return to Scotland this July, he emphasized: “We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They’re killing us”. Trump added Aug. 20 on Truth Social that he “will not approve” wind or solar projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he posted.

While Trump may not prevent every new wind turbine installed in the U.S., he certainly is trying.

Apart from a rapid phasedown of tax credits for wind and solar projects in the One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law in July, the Trump administration has ramped up its attacks on wind—and solar—into a full-scale war, including all but banning new wind and solar projects on federal lands and waters, keeping wind turbines away from highways and railroads, investigating turbines for eagle deaths, and, most recently, making it harder for renewables to even qualify for the short-lived credits eliminated after 2027.

Potentially most onerously, wind or solar projects must now go through three levels of federal review, including personally by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who said in August that “gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. energy dominance.” These secretary-level reviews include many proposed on private land. Earlier this month, the administration canceled the massive Lava Ridge Wind Project in Idaho, yanking permits approved last year.

While Trump has long despised wind turbines, he’s only made it a top political priority in 2025. More wind projects were built during Trump’s first term than during the Biden administration. It’s only now though that U.S. power demand is surging—thanks to the AI data center boom—and it’s happening just when renewable energy is being handicapped.

Average electricity bill costs are up 7% year over year as of May, according to the Department of Energy, and they’re projected to keep rising.

“It’s a triumph of polarization over pragmatism,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet told Fortune. “What is mind-boggling is that, after eliminating the subsidies, the administration has then gone on the attack with federal mandates and buckets of red tape to actively oppose projects being built.”

Executive ‘double-cross’

The last-minute compromise in the “Big Beautiful Bill” focused on keeping the renewable energy tax credits in place for now—but quickly phasing them out.

To qualify, projects must break ground by July 4, 2026, or be completed by the end of 2027. The key is really on breaking ground by next summer because few started after July 2026 are likely to finish by year-end 2027.

As soon as the omnibus spending law was passed, the Trump administration went to work making it harder to qualify for the tax credits—specifically what counts as breaking ground. Those revised rules were finalized on Aug.15.

It used to be that developers only had to pay 5% of the costs up front to lock in the tax credits. Instead, the 5% rule is eliminated for all but small solar farms, requiring all others to demonstrate that “physical work of a significant nature” has begun on or off-site, such as foundation excavation.

Grumet calls it a “double-cross” to immediately change the rules after reaching a deal that was already tough on the clean power sector. “This is basically an ‘America Last’ energy policy,” he said.

The fear was the administration would change the rules even more dramatically, but some Republican senators—including John Curtis of Utah and Chuck Grassley of Iowa—threatened holds on confirming some Trump nominees until the rules were released. After all, most new wind and solar farms are being built in so-called red states.

Also troublesome for the industry are new foreign-sourcing rules that penalize projects for using Chinese parts in a renewables industry dominated by Chinese supply chains.

Other regulatory aspects are potentially worse for the industry too. For instance, Burgum’s Interior Department went a step further on Aug. 1 to also include “enhanced” reviews for power line transmission projects that are deemed to help enable wind or solar projects.

That order came days after the Energy Department revoked a loan guarantee for the 800-mile Grain Belt Express transmission project from Kansas to Indiana.

Christina Hayes, executive director of Americans for a Clean Energy Grid, told Fortune that the transmission policy move adds more “uncertainty” when the nation rapidly needs more power infrastructure, especially when power lines are agnostic to electricity generated by wind or coal burning.

“There’s no sorting hack for electrons. Once an electron is on the system, it is like all the other electrons,” Hayes said, proceeding to make a Harry Potter reference. “It’s not like, ‘Oh, you’re a Gryffindor electron, you’re a renewable electron, you’re Hufflepuff, you’re coal.’ That’s not how this works.”

Rising obstacles

Potentially the most insidious changes for wind and solar aren’t the outright policy revisions, but the behind-the-curtains roadblocks created: federal websites going dark, meetings canceled, phone calls repeatedly unanswered.

“In order to permit a project, you have to interact with the federal government,” Grumet said. “You’re a developer, and you’ve gone through your 63 of 64 steps, and suddenly you can’t get your final meeting. And now future permits are going to be politicized at the cabinet secretary level for everything from where you put a fence to how you create a road. It’s weaponizing bureaucracy to undermine American energy production.”

For instance, Hayes said Elon Musk’s DOGE cuts contributed to the Energy Department’s staffing for the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program (CITAP) shrinking from about 60 people to six—critical for transmission siting and permitting.

Grumet likened the process to going to the Department of Motor Vehicles in the 1950s-era Soviet Union. “The government is challenging enough when everyone is working towards solutions; it’s impossible when the government is working to create problems.”

All the false claims

Trump has repeatedly called “windmills” a green energy scam and accused them of killing birds and marine life. He’s even falsely said the noise can cause cancer. But mostly, he loathes wind turbines for their aesthetics.

On the other hand, air pollution from fossil fuels can be carcinogenic, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that oil pits cause three times more bird deaths than wind turbines, which were deemed responsible for fewer than 0.01% of human-caused bird fatalities.

Outside of, yes, cats, the leading cause of bird deaths is building and glass collisions, including Trump’s towers in New York and around the world. Trump’s Aberdeen golf complex also was built on sand dunes that housed multiple species of endangered birds.

“The American public sees past the idea that a wind blade is a carcinogen,” Grumet said. “The issue the president really focuses on is the aesthetics. That’s a matter of personal opinion if the president thinks that staring at a natural gas facility is a source of American beauty, and staring at a wind turbine is an assault on the landscape.”

So, why now? One, this Trump administration is more filled with partisan players who were prepared to hit the ground running. Two, the energy fight increasingly has become more politically biased.

“Between 2020 and 2024, I think the whole energy debate became more partisan, and wind power, in particular, got locked into the ‘us versus them’ imagination of the way America works,” Grumet said.

Yes, it’s a tough time for renewable energy in America. Fewer projects will come to fruition. The extent of that decline is unclear. But new natural gas-fired plants and nuclear facilities will take five to 10 years to build. Retiring coal plants will have their lives extended, but only temporarily. New power generation is needed more quickly, and renewables, especially solar power, will still fill most of the short-term gap—with or without tax credits.

A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the company has raised nearly $8.9 million in debt.

Startups raise capital via debt financing to help pay for operations without giving up equity. An Electric Era spokesperson declined to comment on the new funding.

Electric Era launched in 2019 and previously raised $20.5 million from investors. Last summer the business moved into a spacious, 18,000-square-foot facility located south of Seattle’s downtown.

This past June, Electric Era and Washington state officials celebrated the opening of an eight-port, electric vehicle charging system at an A1 Gas and Food off State Route 530, north of Seattle near the town of Arlington. The station was co-funded by the Washington Electric Vehicle Charging Program, which is supported by the state’s Climate Commitment Act.

The company is steadily deploying its charging stations across the U.S. despite efforts by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to curb the EV sector. President Trump took steps in February to halt the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, but last week his administration issued new guidance to states eager to apply for $5 billion worth of NEVI grants.

The GOP’s “Big Beautiful Bill” ends tax credits after Sept. 30 for consumers purchasing EVs, and it eliminates a tax break for EV charging infrastructure by the end of next year.

Electric Era’s strategy is to pair its stations with existing businesses. It has installed chargers at a Costco in Ridgefield, Wash., mini-marts in Oregon, a shawarma shop outside of Boston, and locations in California, Florida, New Mexico, Kentucky, Delaware, Tennessee and Missouri. Dozens of additional sites are in the works according to the company’s station map.

CEO and co-founder Quincy Lee touts the speed at which Electric Era stations are built and installed, and their affordability and reliability.

It takes roughly six to eight months to deploy a station from the start of a project.

The systems are slightly more expensive than Tesla, but at least 25% cheaper than other competitors, Lee said in October.

Online, real-time tracking shows that the chargers are operational about 98% of the time. One of the challenges that have plagued other EV charging stations is how often they’re not functioning.

Fast-charging stations gulp electricity, but Electra Era’s inclusion of a battery storage system eliminates the need for new high-power grid connections for the chargers. It can also slash operating costs by up to 70%, the company reports, by drawing power from the batteries instead of the grid during times of high demand.

Each Electric Era charging device, which has ports for two vehicles, can deliver as much energy as is consumed by 200 homes. A typical station will have four chargers and serve about 150 cars per day.

Joe Nguyễn, director of the Washington State Department of Commerce, praised the Electric Era installation at the A1 Gas and Food site. Its opening was the first of 136 new public DC fast charger installations funded through the state’s program.

“This charging station is a result of collaboration between Washington state, private industry and local leaders to solve real-world challenges,” Nguyễn said in a statement. “It’s about cleaner air, stronger communities, and creating a more reliable EV experience for Washington drivers.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Costco-ElectricEra-EV-Fast-Charging-Station-1260x945.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:06:14.242018

Unlike traditional bid-build methods, this model fosters real-time collaboration between the utility, the designers, and the builders from day one. For GLWA, that’s translated into faster execution, cost predictability, and more responsive design choices that reflect operational realities—not just theoretical plans.

This partnership evolved from a preliminary energy audit that NORESCO conducted at GLWA facilities. That initial engagement organically expanded into design work for Phase 1, ultimately leading to the comprehensive scope now underway in Phase 2. The process illustrates how early value delivery can mature into long-term, trust-based collaboration on high-impact infrastructure projects.

The continuity also helps ensure that every stage of the project aligns with GLWA’s operational goals and long-term vision, rather than piecing together multiple vendors with conflicting priorities.

If your power bills are getting higher and higher, you’re not alone. That’s probably little comfort, but here’s some proof anyway: Utilities requested or were granted a total of $29 billion in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to a study from advocacy group PowerLines. That’s more than double the total in the same period last year.

The biggest reason for these rising prices stems from the piece of the grid you can see from your window, as Heatmap reports. Utility poles and wires, also known as the distribution grid, shuttle power from high-voltage transmission infrastructure into homes and businesses. Over the last few years, building and maintaining these lines has become the biggest source of costs that utilities recoup via power bills, according to a December report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Natural disasters are also driving up expenses as they force utilities to repair and harden their grid for future weather events. California utilities, for instance, have to rebuild after wildfires and in some cases are spending even more money to underground lines. In the Southeast, utilities routinely look to raise rates to cover post-hurricane restoration costs.

Then there’s the fact that natural gas remains the U.S.’s dominant energy source and that prices for that fuel remain higher than they were over much of the last two years.

Now for the second big question: Will things get better anytime soon? Probably not, for a few reasons.

For starters, power demand is on the rise, stemming in large part from the construction of energy-hungry data centers. Tech giants plan to keep building facilities to run their AI operations, and how they’re powered — and how that demand is managed — could end up making everyone else’s electricity more expensive.

That demand could be largely satiated by new solar and wind farms, which are typically quicker and cheaper to stand up than fossil-fueled and especially nuclear power plants. But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Republicans passed in July will soon wipe out federal tax credits that incentivized clean energy construction.

Instead, the Trump administration is pushing to keep aging fossil-fuel power plants online past their retirement dates — a mission that could end up costing utility customers as much as $6 billion each year by the end of President Donald Trump’s term. A federal order that kept a Michigan coal plant open past its planned closure cost its operator $29 million in its first five weeks, and just this week the Energy Department reupped the facility’s extension until November.

Treasury rules tighten access to clean energy tax credits

The U.S. Treasury Department has released guidance that will make it harder to access wind and solar tax credits before their ultimate expiration, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act gives wind and solar developers two options to tap the credits: They must either put their project in service by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 2026. The Treasury’s new guidance narrows the federal government’s longstanding definition of what marks the start of construction.

Still, things could’ve been a lot worse, experts told Jeff — deadlines to finish work could’ve been accelerated, for example. And with these rules, developers have the clarity they’ve been waiting for to make decisions and get building.

USDA pulls support from solar, wind on farmland

Federal assistance for solar and wind power on farmland is fading. On Tuesday, the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that it will ​“no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland or allow solar panels manufactured by foreign adversaries to be used in USDA projects.” It will also render wind and solar projects ineligible for the agency’s Business and Industry loan program, and bar Rural Energy for America Program loans from being used for ground-mounted solar projects larger than 50 kW.

The Trump administration has already taken multiple shots at REAP, Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen reported in July, freezing nearly $1 billion in funding for farmers and closing a window for new applications before it even opened.

Through the adoption of Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure Service Plan for Rotating Equipment, Holcim has shifted from a reactive “wait and fix” approach to a predictive, data-driven model.

Sensors placed on power lines, combined with AI algorithms, convert raw data into real-time insights.

The result is fewer breakdowns, longer equipment life and more reliable operations.

Advancing Holcim’s net zero strategy

Sustainability is at the core of Holcim’s global strategy to reinvent building for a low-carbon, circular and energy-efficient future.

The company’s net zero targets for 2030 and 2050 are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), covering all scopes across the value chain.

Holcim Romania’s actions align with this wider strategy, focusing on:

Scaling sustainable products, with a target of 50% of net sales from ECOPlanet cement and ECOPact ready-mix by 2030

Accelerating circular construction through 20 million tonnes of recycled construction and demolition materials via the ECOCycle platform

Reducing net emissions to below 400kg per tonne of cementitious material

Cutting freshwater withdrawal by 33% compared with 2020 to protect ecosystems.

“With our sustainable building solutions, Holcim is committed to building cities that work for all,” says Nollaig Forrest, Chief Sustainability Officer at Holcim, in the company’s 2024 Climate Report.

“With our seven large-scale carbon capture projects in Europe, engineered to produce eight million tons of net zero cement per annum by 2030, we are on track to make net-zero cement and concrete a reality at scale this decade.”

By embedding advanced monitoring technologies such as EcoStruxure, Holcim is also improving operational efficiency by lowering energy demand and extending equipment lifecycles, which directly supports decarbonisation goals.

Building for a growing city

Holcim Romania’s commitment to sustainable construction is evident in major infrastructure projects such as the Bucharest Metro M5 line, a 7 km expansion serving the densely populated Drumul Taberei neighbourhood.

The metro line, expected to serve around 50,000 passengers daily, addresses the city’s pressing mobility and emissions challenges.

Holcim supplied hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of conventional and specialised concrete, along with tens of thousands of tonnes of cement for soil consolidation.

(DTN) -- The Trump administration granted full small-refinery exemptions on 63 petitions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, while granting partial exemptions on 77 petitions and denying 28 petitions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Friday.

In addition, the EPA announced it will be releasing a proposed rule to reallocate gallons exempted from 2023 and later years. The agency said it determined that seven SRE requests were ineligible. This means the EPA still has 57 total exemption requests pending.

""EPA does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016 to 2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use,"" the agency said in a news release.

""EPA will also be providing updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation's fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today's actions and projected SREs granted for 2025-2027 in Set 2.""

EPA said the supplemental proposal will seek to ""balance the goals of the RFS"" in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while considering ""economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.""

According to the 31-page document released by the EPA on the decision, the granted full and partial exemptions account for 5.34 billion Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs. What's more, the agency said it has moved away from presuming that all refineries can fully pass RIN costs to consumers and acknowledged that some refineries may face higher RFS compliance costs.

This is a significant change from previous assumptions made by the EPA on the RFS costs.

In addition, the EPA said it was reaffirming a policy to return RINs previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year.

Under the RFS program, RINs have a two-year window for use, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the following compliance year.

""Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window,"" the EPA said.

""Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.""

EPA said it also reaffirmed the policy it set in the first Trump administration in granting partial relief -- a 50% exemption -- where a small refinery has demonstrated that it faces partial hardship.

""With today's action, EPA is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA's relief should reflect those differences,"" the EPA said on Friday.

The U.S. ethanol industry has expressed concern that if the SREs are not handled properly by the agency, the ethanol market could suffer.

According to the EPA's small-refinery exemption dashboard just ahead of the announcement, the 204 pending exemptions cover 2016 to 2025. That includes two pending in 2016 and one in 2017. There are 38 pending from 2018; 29 from 2019; 30 from 2020; 22 from 2021 and 2023; 19 in 2022; 30 from 2024 and 11 requested in 2025.

Chair Thomas Gleeson filed a memo on Wednesday discussing a possible “hard” or “soft” cap of $1.8 billion on the capital costs that Entergy Texas could seek recovery and profit on.
Entergy Texas is projecting that its summer coincident peak load will increase by approximately 19.7%, or 746 MW, by 2028, and by 29.5%, or about 1.1 GW, by 2034.
According to Gleeson’s memo, a “soft” cap could establish a presumption that, to the extent capital costs exceed $1.8 billion, Entergy Texas did not act prudently.
Entergy Texas filed comments last month discussing the potential for cost caps.","Dive Brief:

The Public Utility Commission of Texas is considering imposing cost caps on an Entergy proposal to build two gas-fired power plants with a combined capacity of about 1.2 GW, saying the utility failed to consider alternatives and hasn’t shown the projects to be cost effective.

The two plants would cost about $2.4 billion, according to a proposed decision that recommends denying the application — but also acknowledges regulators may approve the projects with conditions. Chair Thomas Gleeson filed a memo on Wednesday discussing a possible “hard” or “soft” cap of $1.8 billion on the capital costs that Entergy Texas could seek recovery and profit on.

“Given the lack of process and consideration of alternatives, I think we need to consider conditions,” Gleeson said at the PUCT open meeting on Thursday. “When the process is done this way, where ... potentially lower cost alternatives were not really considered, I think that puts us in a tough spot.”

Dive Insight:

Electricity demand in Texas is growing rapidly, contributing to the “tough spot” Gleeson mentioned.

Entergy Texas is projecting that its summer coincident peak load will increase by approximately 19.7%, or 746 MW, by 2028, and by 29.5%, or about 1.1 GW, by 2034. Winter peaks are also expected grow significantly.

The utility filed its application for the 754-MW Legend Power Station and 453-MW Lone Star Power Station plants last year, noting the plan was a product of the utility’s “integrated and holistic resource plan.”

“No party disputes that [Entergy Texas] has a significant near-term need for additional capacity,” the proposed decision says. “The primary contested issue is whether [Entergy Texas] demonstrated that the Dispatchable Portfolio is a cost-effective alternative to meet that need.”

According to Entergy, at an expected $1,800/kW the plants are about 25% below current market prices. And the utility said it projects the plants will produce more than $280 million in net benefits for the communities it serves.

The Texas Industrial Energy Consumers group, Office of Public Utility Counsel and PUCT staff raised concerns with how the gas plants were selected and that Entergy Texas did not conduct a request for proposals to determine which projects to pursue.

Texas law does not require an RFP process for generation projects to receive a certificate of convenience and necessity, and Entergy Texas said the impending need for new capacity left no time to develop one. But that has not assuaged regulators’ concerns.

“The need for additional generation is clear. And so we’re kind of backed into a corner on this one, and that’s not a position I like this commission be to be put in,” Gleeson said. “I’m less than happy with the process by which this was done.”

In a statement, Entergy Texas said it appreciated the PUCT discussion and that regulators recognized “the critical need for new, 24/7 resources. We believe the Legend and Lone Star power stations are the right fit to meet our customers’ needs, and we look forward to the Commission’s decision in the next open meeting.”

The gas plants will be back on the commission’s agenda at the September 11 open meeting.

According to Gleeson’s memo, a “soft” cap could establish a presumption that, to the extent capital costs exceed $1.8 billion, Entergy Texas did not act prudently. The utility could seek to place amounts in rate base above the $1.8 billion cost cap, but it would need to rebut the presumption in a base rate case.

Entergy Texas filed comments last month discussing the potential for cost caps.

“When a utility undertakes hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in generation investment, it needs assurance that its choice of action will not be subject to re-litigation,” it said.

“If cost recovery can be denied based on hindsight and second-guessing in a rate case that takes place years down the road, it is difficult to imagine any rational utility in this state investing, for example, $2.4 billion in new dispatchable gas generation,” Entergy Texas told regulators.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hIURurA3QWk5-xX6PoCE3Dql4ok7oaYV7uX-NKBoaN4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UZXhhc1BVQ1RBdWd1c3RfTGdUUnZhai5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-08-22 13:07:14.155848

This map illustrates how electricity prices have changed between May 2024 and May 2025 for each US state.
On average, retail residential electricity prices increased by about 6.5 percent, and the map shows stark regional differences.","The US Department of Energy announced last week the initial selections for its Reactor Pilot Program, which intends to fast-track the testing and deployment of advanced nuclear reactor projects. The pilot program forms part of the Trump administration’s larger goal of accelerating nuclear power development in the United States, as evidenced in part by several executive orders and by the creation of a new bonus tax credit for “nuclear energy communities” in the recent reconciliation bill. In a new If/then blog post, Resources for the Future (RFF) Fellow Daniel Raimi unpacks the bill’s definition of nuclear energy communities and highlights uncertainties in the legislative language which may ironically prevent those communities that are most dependent on nuclear power from accessing the new tax credits. “If lawmakers intend to steer investment toward US energy communities, including those that rely on coal, oil, gas, and nuclear energy, then Congress will need to update its metrics and terminology to more precisely target the places that are most reliant on those sectors,” says Raimi.

The uncertain future of the endangerment finding, a landmark 2009 decision from the US Environmental Protection Agency which found that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, has prompted broad concerns about meeting US climate goals. The uncertainty has implications for local and regional emissions-reduction ambitions such as those in Washington State. The endangerment finding underpins various federal regulations of greenhouse gas emissions, such as mandates for electric vehicles; its repeal could compromise the state’s ability to enforce such regulations. But one of Washington’s climate initiatives would not be directly affected by a repeal: its cap-and-invest system, a market-based policy that offers economic incentives for reducing emissions. In a recent In Focus video, RFF Research Associate Nicholas Roy explains how Washington, California, and states in the Northeast are using these trading systems to meet their climate goals while raising state revenues and balancing concerns from residents about gas prices and energy costs. “If all these states succeed at updating their programs in these ways, then they might actually come up with a really innovative way to think about how we can have ambitious climate policy that is both fiscally responsible and addresses affordability issues for households,” says Roy.

Average nominal US retail residential electricity prices have risen by about 21 percent between 2021 and 2024, according to the latest available data from the US Energy Information Administration, with prices in some states like Maine and California rising even faster. Electricity affordability has become a major focus in US policy, with leaders across the political spectrum invoking affordability as a key motivation for a wide variety of energy proposals. In a new blog post, RFF Fellows Jesse Buchsbaum and Jenya Kahn-Lang visualize the trends and drivers of electricity prices in five new charts and analyze the impact of related policies on American households. “Ultimately, we hope to provide insights into how policy and practice can limit residential electricity costs and provide actionable starting points for regulators and policymakers who are looking to make electricity more affordable,” say Buchsbaum and Kahn-Lang.

As government officials and others revisit the endangerment finding, Richardson now emphasizes that the Trump administration’s proposal marks a sharp break from how earlier administrations approached climate policy. “In the 2000s, the George W. Bush administration did not wish to advance climate policy, but outright denial of climate science was a fringe position that was politically untenable. Speaking from my experience working with some of them, bipartisan officials within the government generally accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, though they often disagreed over the pace or scope of policy action,” says Richardson. “In that political environment, the Bush administration resorted to delaying tactics. That historical moment is in stark contrast to today, as the Trump administration not only opposes climate policy but openly challenges the science itself, and what was once politically impossible now has entered the mainstream. This increasingly polarized context underscores the urgency of protecting the role of sound science in policymaking and ensuring that regulatory decisions remain grounded in evidence.”

Wildfire Smoke Creates Large Losses for Societal Welfare

Throughout the summer, smoke from wildfires burning in Canada—which are expected to continue burning into the latter part of this year—has been traveling throughout central Canada and the Midwestern and Northeastern United States, impairing air quality in those regions. This is the second-worst wildfire season recorded in Canada’s history, and it’s prompting concern about the dangers to human health of inhaling the smoke.

RFF Fellow Matthew Wibbenmeyer and Senior Fellow Margaret Walls have assessed the costs of wildfire smoke to societal welfare. “As fires burn, they release many pollutants that are harmful for people to inhale, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and particulate matter,” says Wibbenmeyer. “Even short-term exposure to higher pollution can have substantial health impacts.”

“But the effects of wildfire smoke extend beyond these health consequences,” say Wibbenmeyer and Walls. “Smoke also affects individual well-being indirectly, which can create large losses on a national level. For example, we’ve looked at how increased levels of wildfire smoke affect people’s experiences with outdoor recreation. We estimated that 21.5 million visits per year to recreation sites are affected by smoke, and this effect alone leads to total annual welfare losses of $2.3 billion. Understanding these costs is essential to accurately assessing the benefits of federal spending that aims to mitigate wildfire risk.”

RFF Researchers Contribute Public Comment on Proposed Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel–Fired Electric Generating Units

In June, EPA released a proposal to repeal emissions standards that aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that run on fossil fuels. The agency opened a period of public comment on the proposal, and a group of RFF researchers contributed a response. In their comment, the RFF researchers assess implications of the repeal, including changes in emissions from the US power sector and volatile electricity prices. “The proposed repeal would lead to measurable changes in outcomes for the nation’s electric power sector, especially when assessed in conjunction with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and updated electricity demand forecasts,” say RFF Research Associate Nicholas Roy and Senior Fellow Karen Palmer, who contributed to the public comment.

A Just Transition to Clean Energy Will Consider the Livelihoods of People in Existing Industries

Transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy requires broad structural changes across all sectors of the economy. Such changes would have significant implications for workers and communities, particularly those that depend on the fossil fuel industry. RFF Fellow Daniel Raimi and former RFF Postdoctoral Fellow Luis Fernández Intriago recently published a journal article with coauthors which examines economic policy mechanisms that support just energy transitions—efforts to safeguard livelihoods, jobs, and rights during the energy transition, and which help ensure that affected communities are included meaningfully in decisionmaking. “At its core, [a just transition] remains about delivering justice and leaving no one behind,” say the authors.

Estimating the Costs of Mitigating Methane Emissions Is Essential to Curbing Their Effects

The US oil and gas industry is a major producer of methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. Mitigating the negative effects of methane requires effective strategies to cut emissions and accurate estimates of the costs of doing so. In this working paper, RFF University Fellow Joseph E. Aldy, RFF Board of Directors member Robert Stavins, and a coauthor analyze different approaches to estimating these costs. Their findings highlight opportunities for relatively low-cost abatement of methane emissions produced by the US oil and gas industry.

Understanding Changing Environmental Hazards Can Shape Approaches to Adaptation and Resilience

Climate change is causing dramatic shifts in natural resource systems, from water availability to growing strain on resources. These changes heighten the importance of developing strategies that help communities adapt to new hazards while minimizing the impacts of these hazards on people and the environment. In this journal article, RFF Senior Fellow David N. Wear and coauthors use projections of climate hazards and population trends to evaluate the areas of the United States that face heightened hazard risk, which communities are most vulnerable, and how these insights can guide adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Energy prices across the United States are on the rise. This map illustrates how electricity prices have changed between May 2024 and May 2025 for each US state. On average, retail residential electricity prices increased by about 6.5 percent, and the map shows stark regional differences. This year’s increase in electricity rates continues a national trend of increasing prices since 2021 after nearly 20 years of steady or decreasing prices. Unfortunately, a reprieve from price hikes may be far off. The reconciliation bill phases out renewable energy tax credits; modeling indicates that this phaseout may further increase electricity bills. In their new blog post, RFF Fellows Jesse Buchsbaum and Jenya Kahn-Lang visualize these trends in five simple charts and unpack what these trends mean for American households.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_508525486_16x9.width-600.png,N,,2025-08-22 13:07:20.012144

rachel abrams

From “The New York Times,” I’m Rachel Abrams. And this is “The Daily.”

[THEME MUSIC]

Texas is about to gerrymander five new House seats. In California, they’re ready to retaliate. Governor Gavin Newsom says the California must also redraw its congressional maps to create five new districts, effectively fighting fire with fire. Today, I talked to my colleague, Laurel Rosenhall, about whether California voters will actually go for this plan, whether it’ll even work if they do, and what is at stake either way.

It’s Friday, August 22.

Laurel Rosenhall, so nice to have you on “The Daily.”

laurel rosenhall

Thanks, Rachel. I’m thrilled to be here.

rachel abrams

So we’re talking to you today, because this week, California lawmakers have been rushing through these bills that would make it possible for California to redraw its maps in favor of Democrats, basically to directly counter what we just saw in Texas. And as we’ve been watching this unfold in California, it feels like what we are seeing is actually kind of unusual. And you, Laurel, you have been covering California and its politics for over two decades. So I’m wondering if it feels unusual to you.

laurel rosenhall

Absolutely. This is a really wild storyline here in California. It’s not unusual for California lawmakers to respond when they see red states taking actions that Democrats in California disagree with, such as on abortion or transgender rights or other policies like this. But to see this kind of just raw, hardball politics, just really cutthroat power play between these states is just pretty wild to witness and to cover.

rachel abrams

It sounds like what you’re saying is that what we’re seeing here is California taking that dynamic to kind of a whole new level.

laurel rosenhall

Yeah. This is basically, one side’s playing dirty, the other side’s going to jump in and play dirty, too.

rachel abrams

Well, let’s talk about specifics. What exactly is California doing?

laurel rosenhall

So California is passing a mid-decade redistricting, a gerrymander. And the idea is to just do a direct counter punch to what the Texas Republicans are doing. The difference, though, is in the way that the two states can pass their maps.

In Texas, lawmakers can do it on their own. And in California, it’s more complicated. Lawmakers can’t directly change the maps. They have to go to the voters and ask the voters to make the final approval. And the reason is that in the state constitution, it basically says that politicians don’t have this power to draw political maps.

[PENSIVE MUSIC]

archived recording 1

And the person who has brought us together for this fight of all fights is our friend, Governor Gavin Newsom.

laurel rosenhall

So Governor Newsom and Democratic lawmakers laid their plan out at a press conference last week in Los Angeles.

archived recording (gavin newsom)

We’re working through a very transparent, temporary, and public process.

laurel rosenhall

What they want to do is call for a special election in November —

archived recording (gavin newsom)

We’re putting the maps on the ballot, and we’re giving the power to the people.

laurel rosenhall

— where voters would decide if they want to change the constitution, to accept these new maps that would help Democrats flip five seats in the House of Representatives.

archived recording (gavin newsom)

It’s not complicated. We’re doing this in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said, find me five seats.

laurel rosenhall

And the reason that they’re going for five seats is that Texas Republicans are trying to flip five seats in Texas for the Republicans.

archived recording (gavin newsom)

And here he is, once again, trying to rig the system. He doesn’t play by a different set of rules. He doesn’t believe in the rules. And as a consequence, we need to disabuse ourselves of the way things have been done.

laurel rosenhall

So the argument is that this country is in basically a state of emergency, that there needs to be a more effective check on President Trump. And that the only way to do that is for Democrats to win control of the House of Representatives next year.

archived recording (gavin newsom)

It’s not good enough to just hold hands, have a candlelight vigil, and talk about the way the world should be.

laurel rosenhall

Here in California, there’s a lot of experiences that make people feel like California, specifically, is under attack by this administration.

archived recording (gavin newsom)

Right outside at this exact moment are dozens and dozens of ICE agents.

[BOOING]

You think it’s coincidental?

laurel rosenhall

The immigration raids, climate legislation that’s been overturned by the president. There’s the question of disaster aid from the fires in Los Angeles. And so the argument from Democrats in California is not about the maps. The Democrats are really trying to make the argument about what’s happening in America.

archived recording (gavin newsom)

That’s what this is all about. It’s about power. And I want to end on this. We’re giving the people of this state the power to save democracy, not just in California, but all across the United States of America.

[CHEERING]

rachel abrams

Because all of this is basically asking voters to reverse themselves, I want to talk about why this was even voted into law in the first place.

laurel rosenhall

Yeah.

archived recording (arnold schwarzengger)

I’m going to run for governor of the state of California.

[CHEERING]

laurel rosenhall

So here, we get to go back to the era of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He took office in 2003. And he was obviously in the peak of his fame as an actor.

archived recording (arnold schwarzengger)

Hasta la vista, baby.

laurel rosenhall

He had had a career as a bodybuilder.

rachel abrams

He was the governator.

laurel rosenhall

He was the governator.

archived recording (arnold schwarzengger)

I’ll be back.

laurel rosenhall

And he came to Sacramento with no experience holding office and little experience in politics. And he told me in an interview that when he got into office, he didn’t even realize that drawing district boundaries is part of the portfolio of power that lawmakers have. He described becoming aware of this idea that the district boundaries had been drawn in a way so that the districts were intensely liberal or intensely conservative in order to assure re-election for the politicians. And he felt that it created such a barrier.

rachel abrams

Such gridlock, right?

laurel rosenhall

Exactly.

archived recording (arnold schwarzengger)

What you have to understand, that the people of California did not send me to Sacramento to support the Democrats or to support the Republicans. They have sent me to Sacramento to clean house.

laurel rosenhall

Part of his governing style was really this kind of bipartisan approach. He was really trying to do things in a centrist way. And he talked about discussing environmental policy with Republicans or discussing education reform with Democrats.

And that the lawmakers would say to him, that’s a really good idea. I like what you’re talking about, but I can’t vote for it. I represent a very liberal district or I represent a very conservative district.

rachel abrams

He’s basically saying, as a result of all this gerrymandering, I can’t get anything done.

laurel rosenhall

Exactly.

archived recording (arnold schwarzengger)

The people of California are not served well by a system that is so gerrymandered that 99 percent of the incumbents get re-elected in the districts that they themselves drew.

laurel rosenhall

And it also means that they, in Schwarzenegger’s view, didn’t have to work very hard to keep their seats, because there was very little competition and there was very little incentive for them to change the way that they governed or do anything differently.

archived recording (arnold schwarzengger)

We need a system of truly competitive legislative districts. So when lawmakers go home, can be held accountable.

laurel rosenhall

So he becomes interested in this idea of redrawing the district boundaries in a way that is more independent and less partisan. And he ends up putting a proposal forward that would put this power in the hands of an independent commission.

archived recording (arnold schwarzengger)

Legislative districts will be drawn by politically diverse citizens and who reflect our state’s population and are free of conflict of interest.

rachel abrams

How was this received, this idea of this new independent commission? Because it’s basically the opposite of what was happening in your description.

laurel rosenhall

Yeah. It was contentious. So this question goes on the ballot in 2008 for California voters. And it was a big fight. And it was a close vote. The first measure in 2008 passed by just under 51 percent.

But then California voted to expand the power to include drawing lines for Congress. And that one passed overwhelmingly, about 60 percent of voters were for it. And also during this time, there was an attempt to repeal the independent commission, and that was defeated. So basically, within a couple of years, there were three votes that upheld the voters’ interest in having this power taken away from politicians and be given to this independent commission.

rachel abrams

Basically, the voters made it very clear that they like the idea of independence.

laurel rosenhall

Correct. And this was game over for gerrymandering and for politicians controlling the line-drawing process. And after that, Democrats actually picked up more seats after the independent committee redrew the maps. The state overall is very Democratic.

But we’ve seen since the independent commission was put in place, that some regions of California are really competitive. And now we routinely have House races that are nail-biters. They’re super close. And it’s no longer uncommon to see House districts flip back and forth between the two parties.

rachel abrams

I just want to point out that I feel like a lot of people might be surprised to hear that this independent redistricting initiative was being pushed by a Republican governor. And that it was Democrats or at least some Democrats who were opposed to it, because I feel like the public perception of gerrymandering, just generally, is that Republicans are the ones who are often accused of it, right? And it’s the Democrats who oppose it publicly.

laurel rosenhall

Yeah, it does seem like that, especially now. Eric Holder, who was Barack Obama’s attorney general, has become a big champion of independent redistricting. But, in fact, in states across the country, whichever party holds control of the legislature usually engages in gerrymandering. Whether they’re Democrats or Republicans, they will usually try to work things to their advantage.

rachel abrams

laurel rosenhall

Correct.

rachel abrams

OK. So given all of that, that there’s basically this consensus between the politicians and what the public seems to want, that they all like this independent system, it feels sort of striking that the tactic now is to say, OK, we’re actually going to go back on that.

laurel rosenhall

Yeah, it’s a tough line to walk. I mean, on the one hand, Newsom and the Democrats are saying, we believe in independent redistricting. We’re proud of the system. We wish that the entire country would do it the way California does.

But they’re saying that right now, things are really bad. And that basically President Trump has created an emergency for democracy. And it requires a different and emergent response.

[WHIMSICAL MUSIC]

They’re telling voters that this will only be temporary. That this gerrymander will be in place for the next three elections. And then California will go back to using its independent commission.

rachel abrams

Right. They’re basically saying, we still believe in this concept, but we’re pausing because the world is on fire.

laurel rosenhall

Yeah. And so the Democratic leaders in California, they decide to go for it, even though there’s no guarantee that it will pay off for them in the end.

rachel abrams

We’ll be right back.

So, Laurel, what happens when Democratic leaders try to call this special election, this effort to redraw the maps?

laurel rosenhall

Well, they have to start by drawing the maps. And that happened very secretively over the course of the last few weeks. And then on Monday morning, the legislators came back to Sacramento and introduced a package of bills. One of them contained the new maps that had been redrawn. Others called for the special election and made other changes that would need to be made to send this thing to the ballot for voters to consider.

archived recording 2

Good morning.

archived recording 3

Good morning.

archived recording 2

I’d like to call the August 19, 2025 hearing of the assembly elections committee to order.

laurel rosenhall

And then Tuesday, there’s a hearing where Democratic lawmakers make their case, that voters should get the chance to change the constitution and approve this temporary gerrymander.

archived recording 2

You may begin.

archived recording 4

Thank you, Madam Chair and colleagues. Good morning. I’m pleased to present ACA8. But make no mistake, I’m not happy to be here.

laurel rosenhall

And they’re really clear.

archived recording 4

ACA8 and its companion bills are the culmination of a fight that we don’t want. And it’s a fight that we didn’t choose.

laurel rosenhall

Basically, they’re saying, President Trump has forced us to do this.

archived recording 4

And ACA8 is our response to this undemocratic and un-American power grab.

laurel rosenhall

And, of course —

archived recording 5

Madam Chair, I make a motion to amend.

archived recording 2

Amend what?

laurel rosenhall

Republicans on the committee are upset.

archived recording 5

I didn’t get this till last night, because we were not informed.

laurel rosenhall

They feel like Democrats are ramming it through. There’s no transparency. They’re in the minority, so they were left out of the process of drawing the maps.

rachel abrams

Right.

laurel rosenhall

And Republicans just don’t have the votes in the California legislature to kill anything with their votes.

archived recording 5

I asked to read the amendments into the journal.

archived recording 6

Second.

laurel rosenhall

So they’re doing everything they can to gum up the works and slow down the process.

archived recording 2

I reject that, no.

archived recording 6

On what grounds, Madam Chair?

archived recording 2

My decision.

archived recording 5

Can you speak to the cost of the ACA and how much it’s going to cost the taxpayers of California?

laurel rosenhall

Another point of concern raised by Republicans is just the sheer cost of putting on a special election.

archived recording 4

Somewhere between $200 and $250 million.

laurel rosenhall

And the fundamental idea of taking an action that goes against the will of the voters.

rachel abrams

So substantive arguments, too.

laurel rosenhall

Absolutely. And there are some former members of the redistricting commission —

archived recording 7

I’m a registered Democrat, always have been.

laurel rosenhall

— including some who are Democrats who are just upset about the idea of changing the process —

archived recording 7

This can’t be at the expense of the California Constitution or the California voters who mandated fair, nonpartisan redistricting.

laurel rosenhall

— and the idea of taking this power back to politicians that voters had very explicitly taken away from them.

archived recording 7

California set the gold standard for redistricting. This is not the time to take a step back from innovative democracy. Thank you.

laurel rosenhall

We go row by row.

laurel rosenhall

And then when it was time for the opposition —

archived recording 9

I was always brought up to believe that two wrongs do not make a right.

laurel rosenhall

— that’s where we saw a lot of emotion come out.

archived recording 9

Strongly oppose this bill and the blatant hypocrisy.

archived recording 10

All due respect, the argument is that we want to preserve democracy. You cannot preserve democracy by suspending it.

archived recording 11

Strong opposition to this bullying method you’re using.

laurel rosenhall

A lot of them were Republicans.

archived recording 12

California Republicans are already disenfranchised. This will disenfranchise us more.

laurel rosenhall

A lot of them were from areas of California that could become less represented.

archived recording 12

And you guys are actually doing us a favor, so thank you, because people are going to come out in mass against this.

laurel rosenhall

And some of them are warning the lawmakers that they could really alienate the voters who put them in office.

archived recording 2

OK, seeing no witnesses and opposition. We’ll bring it back to the dais. Members, any questions, comments?

rachel abrams

So it sounds like some of these commenters are basically trying to say, you might not want to do this. You might be selling out your voters. They’ve been pretty clear about what they want. And that what they want is independent redistricting.

laurel rosenhall

Right.

archived recording 13

Many of us prefer the old rules. We prefer the agreement we all had to play by those rules.

laurel rosenhall

And Democrats recognize that.

archived recording 13

But when autocrats change the rules and the norms that we are using to decide who has power, we can either fight back or we can potentially permanently lose the ability ever to fight back again in the future.

laurel rosenhall

But they think that because many voters in California are really unhappy with the Trump administration and understand that if Democrats win the House, they’ll be able to put a check on some of Trump’s impulses, that voters might be open to setting aside the way that California has done things for a long time and do it differently, at least for a little while. But of course —

archived recording 14

California voters will have the final say on whether or not these new district boundaries get used or not.

laurel rosenhall

— the voters will get to decide. This is ultimately going back to the voters for their decision.

archived recording 14

Because here in California, unlike in Texas and other Republican-led states, we respect the will of the voters.

archived recording 2

That bill passes 5 to 2.

laurel rosenhall

And so that’s what happens. The Democrats control the legislature. They passed this thing out of committee. It passes through both houses. And yesterday, the governor signed it into law, which means that California is now heading toward a special election in November.

rachel abrams

And I guess then the question will become, will California voters, who are mostly Democratic, will they agree with their representatives that basically unusual times call for unusual measures? Will voters perceive the Trump administration and what Texas is doing to be the emergency that lawmakers seem to?

laurel rosenhall

That’s what we’re going to find out with this election. There is reason to believe they have a shot at this. So far, the independent polls show that California voters continue to really like their independent commission, that they don’t want to completely delete this from the state constitution. But at the same time, we are seeing signals that their support for this temporary approach.

Newsom’s camp has some polling numbers that look promising. And former President Obama publicly endorsed it this week, which was pretty huge. He called it a responsible approach. But there is always the chance that it won’t succeed. There will be a robust opposition to this.

archived recording 15

The fight against redistricting before the midterm elections has been fierce and vocal.

archived recording 16

For someone who keeps talking about democracy, he undermines it at every step.

laurel rosenhall

Republicans nationally are raising money to oppose it.

archived recording 17

And entering the debate today is former governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Posting this picture on X, saying, I’m getting ready for the gerrymandering battle, while wearing a T-shirt that says, terminate gerrymandering.

laurel rosenhall

And Governor Schwarzenegger and other supporters of the original reforms are going to be fighting to hold on to the way California does its redistricting.

archived recording 18

Governor Schwarzenegger has a 20-year history of battling gerrymandering. And he believes gerrymandering is evil no matter who does it.

laurel rosenhall

So I think we are heading into a not perfectly predictable situation.

rachel abrams

OK, so it’s still somewhat of an open question whether the Democrats will even get these new maps. But another gamble here seems to also be that even if the Democrats do get these new maps, the question is whether these maps will actually produce the results that they’re hoping for, right? Everywhere across the country, Democrats are losing a lot of voters.

And not just any voters, but voters who seem traditionally solidly Democrats. I’m thinking about people of color, young people. These are folks that the Democrats are learning and have been learning that they can no longer rely on in the ways that they’re used to.

laurel rosenhall

Right. I think what you’re saying is that in the end, voters still get to vote. And so even if these maps are drawn in a way that’s meant to help one party or help the other party, what really matters is who turns out and how they vote. And with these five seats that the Democrats are targeting in California, three of them, they feel very confident that the Democratic candidate will win. And two of them, they’re hoping they can flip them. But it’s definitely not a slam dunk. The other point I would make is that across the country, Republicans have more opportunities to redraw their maps than Democrats do.

rachel abrams

Would other Democratic states then match those Republican states, too, in that case?

laurel rosenhall

We’ll see. Governor Newsom is definitely calling on them to do that and asking other blue states to get into this game as well. But there are fewer opportunities. One thing is that there’s no state as big as California that has as many House seats as California, so that’s one limitation.

Another has to do with the rules of redistricting. They’re different in every single state. And so in New York, for example, the governor is talking about doing some kind of redistricting. But because of the way the laws are written in New York, it wouldn’t take effect until after the 2026 election.

And then there are other states where Democrats have control, like Maryland or Illinois, but the opportunity for pickups is very minimal. They might only be able to redraw the maps to pick up another one seat or two seats. And there’s not necessarily evidence that they’re ready to do that.

rachel abrams

But theoretically, this could just keep going tit for tat, where one Republican state gets matched by a Democratic state, in sort of a gerrymandering arms race.

laurel rosenhall

Yep.

rachel abrams

I also wonder if this focus on redrawing maps takes away from the party’s basically just doing the work of convincing people that they’re the right ones to lead the country, that they are the ones with the better policies. What about just, I don’t know, old-fashioned persuasion to win elections?

laurel rosenhall

Yeah. It’s a really good question. And I think it’s something that the Democratic Party is going to have to confront in this battle. You’re going to hear people saying, is this really speaking to what voters care about, drawing district lines? How is that addressing their needs?

How is that addressing the high cost of gasoline or groceries? How is that addressing the performance of their schools that their children attend? And so it’s absolutely going to be at issue here. Can they still persuade? Or are they just changing the rules of the game so that they don’t have to?

But one version of persuasion is about showing fight. And particularly in the Trump era, where there is a very cut-throat, political dynamic, and in the last election, where Democrats were seen as being weak and not being able to counter the strength of President Trump, this issue is giving Democrats an opportunity to bring a knife to a knife fight.

They’re showing that they are going to meet the Republicans where they’re at. They’re not going to let Republicans change the game without putting up some fight. And they’re really going against their reputation as being the defenders of the status quo, who are just so obsessed with process and fairness that they forget about winning and getting power.

[PENSIVE MUSIC]

And I think what we’re going to see in this election is how much the Democratic Party has changed. It wasn’t so long ago that Michelle Obama said, when they go low, we go high.

And now, we’re seeing that elected Democrats in California are not playing that game anymore. They’re saying when they go low, we’ll get down there with them and we’ll try to beat them at their own game.

Here’s what else you need to know today. A federal judge on Thursday ruled that New Jersey’s US attorney, Alina Habba, had been serving without legal authority for more than a month, thrusting the state’s already paralyzed federal court system further into disarray. The judge, Matthew W. Brann, disqualified Ms. Habba from participating in any ongoing cases, although he paused the outcome of that decision until the government had a chance to make its case. Still, the ruling was a remarkable rebuke to a Justice Department that, under President Trump, has gone to great lengths to keep its preferred US attorneys in their jobs.

And Manhattan prosecutors announced sweeping corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams’ former chief advisor, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, accusing her of trading her influence for a wide range of benefits, including money, crab cakes, and an appearance on the television show “Godfather of Harlem.” The charges come just one day after another close advisor to Mayor Adams, Winnie Greco, was suspended from his re-election campaign after trying to slip a reporter at least a hundred dollars in cash inside a bag of potato chips.

Stories to watch in the weeks ahead

Climate records – August, traditionally a holiday month in Italy, began with a powerful heatwave pushing temperatures up to 39–40°C in many cities. It followed another spell of extreme heat in late June. July saw the country split between climate extremes: the south saw temperatures reach 45°C; while the north was battered by floods and landslides, particularly in the Alps, cutting off popular mountain destinations such as Cortina d’Ampezzo in the Dolomites. Sardinia faced numerous wildfires along its coasts, forcing the evacuation of dozens of tourists, while a major blaze in the Vesuvius National Park near Naples demanded extensive firefighting efforts by the civil protection service.

CO2 emissions back on the rise – After two and a half years of decline, Italy’s CO₂ emissions from energy use are back on the rise. In the first half of 2025, they are estimated to have grown by about 1.5 percent compared to the same period in 2024, with most of the increase occurring in the first quarter due to a colder-than-average winter that boosted heating demand. The power sector was also a primary driver: poor renewable energy output — hydropower down 20 percent and wind down 12 percent — combined with reduced electricity imports pushed gas-fired generation up by 10 percent. In the next five years, CO₂ emissions will need to fall by six percent per year — almost twice the reduction achieved in the past three years.

Electric car incentives, not for all – Italy has approved nearly 700 million euros in subsidies to boost electric vehicle (EV) adoption, offering up to 10,000 euros to private buyers scrapping older cars. The move comes as the country lags behind much of the EU in EV uptake: in 2024, only 4.2 percent of new registrations were fully electric, placing Italy fifth from last in the Union. By contrast, in the first half of 2025, battery-electric vehicles reached a 15.6 percent market share EU-wide. The structural weakness of Italy’s car market is evident, with sales projected to reach a total of just 1.5 million units in 2025, about 400,000 fewer than in 2019, and the average car on the road is 12.5 years old. Without incentives, industry group UNRAE warned, the transition will stall, especially after the government postponed by a year the planned ban on Euro 5 cars in the country’s most polluted areas. Environmental groups blasted the move as “yet another populist delay.”

The latest from Italy – last month in recap

Italy joins the Nuclear Alliance – In June 2025, Italy formally joined the European Nuclear Alliance, moving from observer status to an active member in working groups and strategic decision-making on the role of nuclear power in the future energy mix. A recent study by ENEA, Italy’s national energy and environment agency, and Confindustria, the country’s main employers’ federation, estimates that new Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR) technologies could generate around 117,000 jobs nationwide, with the first plant potentially coming online by 2035. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security has allocated 7.5 million euros in 2025–2026 for public communication campaigns on nuclear energy and safety — a move criticised by the renewables lobby FREE, which highlights the far smaller pot of funding available for promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Italian court clears landmark climate case against Eni – Italy’s Supreme Court has ruled that a climate lawsuit brought by Greenpeace Italy, ReCommon and 12 citizens against oil and gas major Eni can proceed, in what campaigners called a “historic” step for climate justice in the country. The plaintiffs accuse Eni – along with state-controlled investors Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and the Ministry of Economy and Finance – of knowingly contributing to climate change for decades and failing to align its business with the Paris Agreement. The decision paves the way for the Rome tribunal to examine the merits of the case, which could eventually set a precedent for future climate litigation in Italy. Environmental groups say it puts the country in line with other European states where fossil fuel companies have been held to account.

A twenty–year gas extraction deal – In July, Eni announced the signing of a long-term agreement with US company Venture Global for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Under the contract, Eni will purchase 2 million tonnes per year (MTPA) for two decades from the CP2 LNG project in Louisiana. For Eni, this marks its first long-term LNG agreement for supply from the United States and, according to the company, represents “a key step in the expansion and diversification of its LNG portfolio,” with part of the volumes destined to “reinforce Europe’s energy diversification.” Analysts warn that the 20-year deal is risky: EU gas demand is falling and exposure to US politics and EU methane rules adds price and regulatory volatility, undercutting the agreement’s energy-security and climate rationale.

Violent attacks on renewables – In July, around 50 masked individuals armed with pickaxes and knives stormed a wind farm construction site in Tuscany’s Mugello region, vandalising equipment and threatening workers. The assault, claimed by the group Siamo Montagna (We are mountain), forced contractors to suspend operations and has been described by analysts as an act of “eco-terrorism.” It follows a string of arson attacks against solar and wind projects in Sardinia in 2024, underscoring growing tensions between clean energy expansion and local opposition in parts of Italy. WWF Italy and WWF Tuscany strongly condemned the violence as “unacceptable,” stressing that the energy transition is a necessity and must proceed with the help of civil, inclusive dialogue. The project has long faced opposition from local committees, and after years of legal challenges, the Tuscan administrative court (TAR) in January 2025 rejected appeals against the plant.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-08-22 13:09:36.629116

The case involves a project to overhaul the 50-year-old plant, which uses electricity during periods of low demand (i.e. at night) to pump water into a reservoir. During periods of high demand (i.e. during the day), water is released from the reservoir through hydroelectric turbines that generate over 300 megawatts of electricity. The plant, located on the shores of Lake Michigan, is one of the largest pumped storage projects in the world.

The owner paid Toshiba American Energy Systems (“Toshiba”) over $500M to overhaul and upgrade the plant’s six units, which reopened between 2015 and 2019. The contract provided that Toshiba would return the plant as nearly to new condition as possible and allow the plant to operate with a minimum thirty-year service life with only minimal routine maintenance. Within a few years of reopening, the owner allegedly observed degraded metal in two of the units during a periodic inspection. The owner asked Toshiba and its parent company to repair the units, to no avail. The owner eventually hired another contractor, Voith Hydro, to assess Toshiba’s work and develop a repair plan and estimate. In 2022, the owner filed suit claiming that it could only operate two of the units approximately 50 hours per year due to Toshiba’s allegedly defective work. Among other alleged defects, the owner claims that Toshiba improperly removed certain stainless-steel components, selected unsuitable replacement materials, and used construction methods that caused excessive stress and cracking. The owner seeks to recover over $800M in damages in and prejudgment interest.

Toshiba moved for summary judgment on various grounds earlier this year. For example, Toshiba argued that the owner’s claims were precluded by Toshiba’s achievement of certain interim and final acceptance deadlines in the contract. It also argued that the language of the contractual warranty did not cover the type of damage at issue and did not allow the owner to recover future repair costs not yet incurred. Toshiba further argued that the owner’s claim for prejudgment interest was barred by the contractual waiver of consequential damages, which barred claims for “cost of money” and “loss of capital.” The court rejected all of those arguments. The court did rule in Toshiba’s favor on the limitation of liability clause under the contract, which generally limits Toshiba’s liability to the total price of the contract.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13676_5142.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:04:53.925690

With so much transformation happening, have you ever thought about what energy jobs might look like in the future? Let’s explore the roles and skills that will be necessary.

Key trends in the energy sector

Several major shifts are redefining how energy is produced, delivered, and used. Two of the most important are:

The energy transition

Countries and companies around the world are moving away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydrogen. This shift requires new systems, and new kinds of expertise to build and manage them.

Large-scale infrastructure projects

Large infrastructure projects are changing how energy is produced and used. One example is Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which includes giga-projects such as NEOM. This initiative focuses on building entire ecosystems powered by clean energy, smart grids, and efficient infrastructure. They require professionals such as civil engineers, environmental experts, and digital specialists.

Digitalization: AI, IoT, and Automation

Artificial intelligence, automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are being used to predict energy demand, monitor equipment, and improve safety. These tools are making operations more efficient and opening up new career paths in tech-focused energy roles.

What energy jobs will the future bring?

With all the changes happening in energy, you might wonder what kinds of jobs will be in demand, and what skills you’ll need to stay ahead. Many roles will look quite different from what we know today, combine traditional energy knowledge with new tech and sustainability goals.

Some of the exciting jobs include:

Renewable project developer: people who plan and bring to life solar, wind, and hydrogen projects that power a cleaner future.

Carbon capture specialist: experts who find ways to trap and store carbon emissions before they reach the atmosphere.

Smart grid engineer: professionals working to create energy networks that are flexible, efficient, and can handle lots of renewable power.

EV infrastructure planner: those designing the networks of charging stations that will keep electric vehicles running smoothly.

IoT Systems Integrator: connecting smart sensors and devices to make energy systems safer and smarter.

What This Means for Today’s Professionals

For today’s professionals, it means that change is already here in many ways.

Keep upskilling. The professionals who stay curious and continue to build new skills through training, certifications, or hands-on experience, will be better prepared for what’s ahead. Upskilling isn’t a one-time thing; it’s an ongoing part of staying future-ready.

Be open to new ways of working. Cross-functional teamwork and international collaboration are becoming the norm, and in some cases, that might include relocating to new regions or project sites.

For the second time in a matter of months, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Consumers Energy Company to ensure that the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Mich., remains in operation.

“The United States continues to face an energy emergency, with some regions experiencing more capacity constraints than others,” said U.S. DOE Secretary Chris Wright. “With electricity demand increasing, we must put an end to the dangerous energy subtraction policies embraced by politicians for too long.”

The Aug. 20 order directs MISO, in coordination with Consumers Energy — the investor-owned utility that provides natural gas and electricity to 6.7 million of Michigan’s 10 million residents and owns the Campbell plant — to extend operations of the plant until Nov. 19 to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States.

Wright said the new order “will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”

The secretary also pointed out in the order that he has determined that an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electricity, and other causes.

“Issuance of this order will meet the emergency and serve the public interest,” according to the order, which adds that MISO is directed to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.

Conversely, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) calls the order illegal.

“Mandating this half-a-century-old coal plant to stay open will drive up electricity bills and pollution even higher for families and businesses,” said Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. Clean Energy at EDF.

Rising Midwest temps

The recent order is an attempt to address estimates by the May 2025 NERC Summer Reliability Assessment, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on April 17, that said portions of the Midwest were estimated to have a 33 percent to 40 percent chance to experience above-normal temperatures this summer.

Those estimates rose in the Seasonal Outlook released by NOAA on June 19 that increased the chance to 40 percent to 50 percent.

Consumers Energy around the same time said it would accelerate retirement of the Campbell plant and discontinue its operations on May 31, which is 15 years before the end of its scheduled design life.

Wright then issued his first order May 23 directing MISO and Consumers Energy to keep the 1,420-megawatt (MW) Campbell plant operating through Aug. 20 in order to minimize any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages as the summer began and electricity demand increased.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” the secretary said May 23.

Now, Wright says that the emergency conditions that led to the issuance of the original order persist, and as outlined in DOE’s Grid Reliability Evaluation, power outages could increase by 100 times in 2030 if the U.S. continues to take reliable power offline.

The new order took effect Aug. 21 and continues for another 90 days, until Nov. 19, says DOE, which since May 16 has issued similar emergency orders, pursuant to section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority; to PJM Interconnection in coordination with Talen Energy Corp.; to Duke Energy Carolinas; and to PJM in coordination with Constellation Energy.

Rising consumers costs

According to EDF, such actions by DOE come as more coal plants are slated to be retired.

For instance, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has said that while coal-fired power plants have no mandatory retirement age, power plant owners and operators reported to EIA that they plan to retire 28 percent, or 59 gigawatts (GW), of the coal-fired capacity currently operating in the United States by 2035.

At the same time, Energy Innovation says that 99 percent of the nation’s coal fleet is more expensive to keep running than to replace with new local wind, solar, and battery storage.

“It already cost nearly $30 million to keep the J.H. Campbell coal plant running for the first five weeks this summer,” said EDF’s Kelly. “Imagine the price shock for ratepayers after several months.”

Dan Scripps, chairman of the Michigan Public Service Commission, told CNN in June that the cost to keep the 60-plus-year-old plant operating for 90 more days will be multiple tens of millions of dollars at the low end and close to $100 million at the high end. Customers in 15 states will foot the bill, he said.

Kelly said the “unlawful decision” to force the Campbell plant to keep running “confirms what we already knew: utility and state leaders’ original plan to shift to cleaner, more affordable energy sources was a far better deal for people’s wallets and health.”

In July, EDF joined eight other public advocacy groups to file a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit responding to DOE’s first extension of the Campbell coal plant, as well as the department’s failure to respond to the groups’ earlier request for a rehearing of DOE’s emergency order.

“EDF and allies will continue to fight this unnecessary and illegal action in court,” Kelly said.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CMSWestOliveCampbell04202017-106.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 19:05:02.549833

If planned capacity additions for solar photovoltaic and battery storage capacities are realised, both technologies will add more capacity than in any previous year.
Last year, Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility scale solar capacity.
Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in 1H25 at 26% (5.9 GW), about half of which was in Arizona or California.
Developers in Texas are expecting to bring 7 GW of battery storage capacity online in 2025, with much of that capacity coming online in 2H25.","Developers could set a record for capacity additions if all 64 GW come online this year. The previous record for US generating capacity additions was set in 2002, when developers added 58 GW to the grid, 57 GW of which was fuelled by natural gas. Although developers have added natural gas-fired capacity each year since then, other technologies such as wind, solar, and battery storage have become more prevalent options for new capacity.

If planned capacity additions for solar photovoltaic and battery storage capacities are realised, both technologies will add more capacity than in any previous year. For both technologies, this growth is largely attributable to changes occurring in Texas.

About 27% (3.2 GW) of the solar capacity added so far in 2025 is in Texas, and developers plan to bring another 9.7 GW of solar online in Texas in 2H25. Last year, Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility scale solar capacity.

Developers retired relatively little generating capacity in 1H25. Of the 8.7 GW of electric generating capacity that US operators plan to retire during 2025, only 2 GW was retired in 1H25. Compared with the planned 2025 capacity retirements reported at the beginning of the year, more than 3.6 GW has now been delayed or cancelled, including plans to retire the coal-fired Units 1 and 2 of Brandon Shores (1.3 GW) and oil-fired Units 3 and 4 of Herbert A Wagner (0.7 GW) in Maryland, as well as the natural gas-fired Units 1, 2, and 3 of the V H Braunig plant (0.9 GW) in Texas. If current retirement intentions are realised, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas (19%).

The national conversation over renewable energy has sharpened following new remarks from President Donald Trump and a major policy change by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Federal data released this week showed solar power is on track to provide more than half of all new electricity grid installations in the U.S. during 2025. Despite this growth, Trump repeated his opposition to renewable energy projects, specifically targeting wind and solar.

On his Truth Social platform, Trump stated that no wind or “farmer destroying” solar projects would be approved under his leadership. His comments coincided with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ announcement that the USDA will rescind all existing programs that supported the construction of solar panels on farmland.

Trump also linked renewables to rising electricity prices, calling wind and solar the “scam of the century.” His position aligns with concerns from some farm groups who believe that solar projects compete with agricultural land use.

Still, supporters of renewable energy highlight the opportunities it creates for farmers, including additional revenue streams, job creation, and lower long-term energy costs. The federal data reflects strong national momentum toward renewable energy, with solar now leading all other sources in new capacity growth.

This clash of perspectives highlights the crossroads in U.S. energy policy. While renewable projects continue to expand rapidly, debates over their costs, land impact, and long-term benefits remain central to the future of both farming and energy in America.

From 28 to 31 July 2025, Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), in collaboration with the ASEAN Centre for Energy and with support from the ASEAN-UK Green Transition Fund, hosted the ASEAN Regional Capacity Building Workshop on Energy Transition and Investment Planning in Bangkok, Thailand. The event brought together 30 participants from 7 ASEAN Member States — Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam — as well as Timor-Leste, alongside 8 development agencies, to strengthen capacity in energy transition modelling, scenario planning, and investment pathway formulation.

A Regional Approach to Clean Energy Planning

This inaugural workshop forms part of the ASEAN Energy Transition and Investment for Green Value Chains initiative, designed to support the creation of an integrated ASEAN Energy Transition and Investment Roadmap, that SEforALL is helping to develop. The roadmap will play a pivotal role in delivering the upcoming ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation 2026–2030, advancing the ASEAN Carbon Neutrality Strategy, and informing the ASEAN Energy Outlook 9.

“A comprehensive planning approach with robust tools, skills, and institutions is critical for the ASEAN region to mobilize clean energy investments to achieve common goals for development and climate.”– Alvin Jose, Head of Energy Transition and Energy Efficiency, SEforALL

Hands-On Learning with Practical Tools

Over the course of four days, participants gained hands-on experience with SEforALL Energy Systems Model (SEM), applying national contexts of the energy sector to explore tailored energy transition pathways. Guided by case studies, they learned how to set up key variables in SEM and interpret results for decision-making.

Highlights of the workshop included technical deep dives into power, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture, alongside introductions to complementary tools such as energy access planning platforms, energy demand forecasting models, carbon sequestration models, and multi-criteria analysis frameworks, equipping participants with a well-rounded toolkit for integrated energy transition planning.

""The workshop was very insightful and informative. We gained a new perspective on energy transition and learned to view it in a more holistic way. It also provided valuable insights into possible policy recommendations for the Philippines. Grateful to SEforALL for its efforts in advancing net-zero and for organizing this meaningful workshop.""— Charlene Gem Farro, Department of Energy, Philippines

South-South Exchange and Collaboration

Collaboration was a defining feature of the workshop. Country presentations revealed national priorities, modelling capabilities, and ongoing policy initiatives, enabling participants to identify both common challenges and opportunities for coordinated action.

Development partners, including UNEP, UNESCAP, UNIDO, UNOPS and the Asian Development Bank shared their work in the region, helping participants connect modelling outcomes to real-world implementation.

""The workshop in Bangkok has been such a great learning experience. We spent four full days digging into energy modelling and planning tools, and honestly, it’s made the energy transition feel a lot more real and doable. Everyone was open to share, ask questions, and work together. Super grateful to be part of this journey."" — Dr. Fitria Astuti Firman, Energy and Mineral Resources and the National Energy Council, Indonesia

Key Outcomes

A key outcome of the workshop was the validation of country-specific datasets and assumptions that will underpin the ASEAN Energy Transition and Investment Roadmap (ETIR). In addition, the workshop introduced the ASEAN ETIR modelling framework and methodology to the participants from ASEAN member states for their review and comments.

Through individual country consultations, participants refined inputs to ensure the roadmap reflects both regional consistency and national contexts. These contributions were essential as the regional roadmap cannot be actionable without reflecting the realities and perspectives of each Member State.

Having countries directly shape the inputs strengthens alignment with domestic and regional policies to guide and attract investments to achieve ASEAN’s carbon neutrality goals. The workshop concluded with agreement on next steps to establish a process for validating country outputs and regional scenario development.

Looking Ahead

This workshop was just the beginning. Building on the momentum from Bangkok, the programme will focus on transforming the data, insights, and collaboration established here into a reliable, actionable Energy Transition and Investment Roadmap for ASEAN.

Once in place, this roadmap will serve as a powerful tool for unlocking investment opportunities and delivering on climate commitments while safeguarding energy security and supporting sustainable economic growth.

Hydrogen Locomotives: Retrofitting the Future of Rail While green methanol targets the oceans, HyOrc's hydrogen locomotive program is set to transform land transportation.
The hydrogen locomotive market is projected to grow at a staggering 37.56% CAGR, reaching $130 billion by 2033.
In the hydrogen locomotive space, infrastructure bottlenecks—such as hydrogen refueling networks—could delay widespread adoption.
For those seeking exposure to the decarbonization infrastructure boom, HyOrc offers a dual opportunity: to profit from the scaling of green methanol and to capitalize on the hydrogen locomotive revolution.","The global energy transition is no longer a distant vision—it is a present-day imperative. As industries scramble to meet net-zero targets, companies that can bridge the gap between legacy infrastructure and sustainable alternatives are poised to dominate emerging markets. HyOrc Corporation, a relative newcomer to the decarbonization arena, has rapidly positioned itself at the intersection of two high-growth sectors: green methanol production for marine fuels and hydrogen-powered locomotives. With a strategic focus on scalable, cost-competitive solutions, HyOrc is not just participating in the energy transition—it is engineering it.

Green Methanol: A Maritime Fuel Revolution

The maritime industry accounts for nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions, and the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 2030 and 2050 decarbonization targets have created an urgent demand for low-carbon fuels. Green methanol, a carbon-neutral alternative to traditional bunker fuels, is emerging as a frontrunner. HyOrc's recent projects in the UK and Portugal—each with 80-ton-per-day production capacity—position the company to supply over 38,000 tons of renewable methanol annually by 2026. This output aligns with the projected $6.7 billion market for green methanol in marine fuels by 2035, growing at a 19.7% CAGR.

HyOrc's approach is both innovative and pragmatic. By converting municipal waste and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) into green methanol, the company addresses two critical challenges: waste management and carbon capture. Its partnership with Acetech Metals in Scunthorpe and Start Lda in Porto ensures localized feedstock access, reducing logistical costs and enhancing supply chain resilience. Moreover, the company's modular production systems allow rapid deployment of new facilities, a critical advantage in a market where speed to scale determines success.

Hydrogen Locomotives: Retrofitting the Future of Rail

While green methanol targets the oceans, HyOrc's hydrogen locomotive program is set to transform land transportation. With over 75,000 diesel locomotives in operation across India, the EU, and the UK, the retrofit market is a $2.5 billion opportunity per unit. HyOrc's patented hydrogen-capable powertrain technology enables the conversion of existing diesel engines into zero-emission models at a cost of $2.5 million per locomotive—a fraction of the $10–15 million required to build new hydrogen-powered trains from scratch.

The hydrogen locomotive market is projected to grow at a staggering 37.56% CAGR, reaching $130 billion by 2033. HyOrc's focus on retrofitting aligns with regulatory tailwinds, such as the EU's Green Deal and India's 2025 hydrogen train launch. By targeting regions with aging rail infrastructure, HyOrc avoids direct competition with established players like Alstom and Siemens, who are still perfecting new hydrogen train designs. Instead, it capitalizes on the immediate need for decarbonization in existing fleets.

Strategic Positioning and Competitive Advantages

HyOrc's dual focus on green methanol and hydrogen locomotives creates a unique synergy. The company's methanol production hubs in Europe and North America supply not only marine fuels but also hydrogen for its locomotive projects. This vertical integration reduces dependency on volatile hydrogen prices and ensures a stable supply chain. Additionally, HyOrc's partnerships with local trading companies (e.g., Start Lda) and its modular, off-grid power systems position it to serve remote and underserved markets, where traditional energy infrastructure is lacking.

The company's financial strategy further strengthens its case. By securing an OTCQB uplisting and finalizing customer agreements, HyOrc is preparing for a liquidity event that could attract institutional investors. Its emphasis on subsidy-free solutions also insulates it from policy risks, a critical factor in markets where government incentives are often subject to change.

Challenges and Risks

No investment is without risk. Green methanol's current price premium (450–650 USD/ton vs. fossil methanol at under 250 USD/ton) remains a barrier to adoption. While the Inflation Reduction Act's 45V and 45Q tax credits are helping close this gap, scaling production to meet demand will require significant capital. HyOrc's reliance on municipal waste and RDF also exposes it to feedstock volatility, though its partnerships with waste management firms mitigate this risk.

In the hydrogen locomotive space, infrastructure bottlenecks—such as hydrogen refueling networks—could delay widespread adoption. However, HyOrc's retrofit model reduces the need for new infrastructure, as existing diesel locomotives can be upgraded at existing depots. This approach accelerates deployment timelines and lowers upfront costs for rail operators.

Investment Thesis

HyOrc's strategic alignment with two of the fastest-growing decarbonization markets—marine fuels and rail—makes it a compelling long-term play. The company's ability to leverage modular systems, localized partnerships, and retrofitting technology positions it to outpace competitors in both speed and cost efficiency. With the OTCQB uplisting acting as a catalyst for visibility and liquidity, investors who recognize the urgency of the energy transition may find HyOrc's stock undervalued relative to its growth potential.

For those seeking exposure to the decarbonization infrastructure boom, HyOrc offers a dual opportunity: to profit from the scaling of green methanol and to capitalize on the hydrogen locomotive revolution. As the world races to meet climate targets, companies that can deliver scalable, practical solutions will dominate the next decade of energy innovation. HyOrc is not just a participant in this race—it is a leader.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-22 16:03:49.416610

SOUTH BEND — Indiana is poised to emerge as a leader in the nation’s shift to electric vehicles, with investments in the technology across the state’s different industries.

The Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to EV growth, held a press conference where officials said Indiana’s EV industry has attracted federal funding of $9.4 billion and $14 billion in investments. The endowments will assist over 8,400 Hoosier jobs. In addition, the state’s EV market share reportedly hit 4.9% in the most recent sales quarter, a metric owed to the 33,000 battery-powered vehicles sold.

One of the most notable recent investments is the arrival of Slate Auto, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos set to build customizable electric pickups at the former R.R. Donnelley and Sons printing plant.

Among the Indiana cities embracing the transition is South Bend. The city has installed public charging stations, expanded its municipal EV fleet, and made charging free to encourage adoption. Officials said these moves are aimed at improving air quality, public health and long-term energy independence.

The Washington, D.C.-based Electrification Coalition projected that Indiana drivers could save about $907 a year in fuel costs by switching to electric, while the state strengthens its domestic supply chain for critical minerals and reduces dependence on imported oil. At current sales figures, EV use saves Indiana 13 million gallons of gasoline in total per year.

Across the state, automakers and suppliers are heavily investing in EV production and technology. Cummins, Inc. is expanding in Columbus, EnPower is building batteries in Indianapolis, and Kokomo has become a hub for both SDI to build new ones. Additional projects in Marion, New Carlisle and Warsaw are advancing lithium recycling, battery components and assembly.

Public safety agencies are also adopting EVs. The Walkerton Police Department recently added a 2024 Chevy Blazer EV to its fleet, while New Carlisle’s fire department is using a Silverado EV in its cost-saving campaign.

South Bend schools have deployed two electric buses that recharge between morning and afternoon runs, which drivers say are quieter and smoother than traditional diesel models.

Officials said that the momentum of electrification could determine whether Indiana secures long-term manufacturing jobs and a central role in the clean transportation supply chain.",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric-Vehicle-Charging-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:09:13.535305

These vehicles generate electricity by converting hydrogen in fuel cells, producing only heat and water as byproducts. Despite their near-zero emissions, they are rarely seen on American roads outside of California, the only state with a fueling infrastructure in place.

Major automakers such as Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda have introduced hydrogen fuel cell models, but sales have been modest. Fewer than 20,000 units have been sold or leased nationwide as of the end of July.

""It really is kind of a niche technology that isn't something that's probably going to be seen in mainstream passenger cars, at least not for a very long time in the United States,"" said Keith Barry of Consumer Reports.

Some organizations are exploring the technology. The Philadelphia Eagles maintain a charging station for a small fleet of hydrogen vehicles at Lincoln Financial Field, and SEPTA is conducting research and testing on its buses.

Barry, who has test-driven hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, noted their similarity to conventional cars in terms of performance. However, he highlighted a major drawback.

""Just the main difference was that when I was done driving it, it had to go on a truck and had to go back to California to get refueled,"" he said.

The lack of infrastructure is just one of several hurdles. Production, storage, safety, and cost issues also hinder widespread adoption. Although refueling a hydrogen vehicle takes about the same time as filling a gas tank, hydrogen's properties require high-pressure tanks or cryogenic temperatures, making storage and transport difficult.

""It may be something used by fleets. But I think for the average consumer, you're probably not going to see a hydrogen car anywhere in Philly anytime soon in your driveway,"" Barry said.

Experts point to the convenience of charging electric vehicles at home as a key factor in their growing popularity.

Row after row of solar panels sit amid intermittent shrubs, channeling at their peak 38 megawatts of clean, inexpensive, electricity into Burkina Faso’s national grid. The power is enough to supply 115,000 homes. And it is badly needed. Just one in five Burkinabes have access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.

The plant, which came online in 2024, was made possible in part by a repayable grant from the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP’s) Seed Capital Assistance Facility (SCAF). Since its launch in 2014, the facility has provided development capital to 33 renewable energy projects across Africa. Its funding model – which helps lower risks for private sector investors – could prove pivotal for the future of a continent where electricity remains in short supply, say some.

“Africa has the potential to be a renewable energy powerhouse, holding over 60 per cent of the world’s best solar resources but investor jitters have held back development,” said Hongpeng Lei, Chief of UNEP’s Climate Mitigation Branch. “By providing and unlocking capital, SCAF is supporting African nations to leapfrog into a low-carbon energy future that will benefit hundreds of millions of people and help to keep greenhouse gas emissions in check.”

So far, nine supported projects have reached financial close in Africa and Asia. Research conducted by SCAF has found every dollar invested has unlocked US$88 in private finance. These projects are not only improving access to energy; they are delivering broader benefits for community development and resilience, including new jobs, says Lei.

At a global level, the projects are contributing to the goal of tripling renewables by 2030, which is necessary to meet international climate targets. Once all projects that have received repayable grants are operational, they are expected to have 3,573 megawatts of generation capacity. They’re also slated to employ 26,000 people while preventing the release of 6.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year – equivalent to taking 1.5 million cars off the road.

“Before… I had to travel long distances to fetch water,” said Chisomo Lubaini, who helps manage a borehole drilled by Golomoti Solar. “Having access to clean water … I can use the water for my brick-making business and the time I save can be used for farming.”

In Zimbabwe, SCAF supported a five-megawatt, run-of-the-river hydro plant adjacent to Lake Mutirikwi in Masvingo province. The project, known as the Great Zimbabwe Hydro Power Plant, relies on the country’s first non-consumptive water license, meaning it must return all the water it uses in power generation. Lei says the plant, which came online in 2024, could open the door to many other such projects.

The SCAF’s mandate extends through 2026. UNEP is in discussions with donors to launch the next iteration of the facility, which officials hope will continue to support clean energy projects where they are needed the most.

“As African nations prepare to put forward their next round national climate plans and gather at the next Africa Climate Summit, initiatives like SCAF show that ambition can be matched with action,” says Lei.

UNEP's work is made possible by flexible contributions from Member States and other partners to the Environment Fund and UNEP’s Climate, Nature and Pollution funds. These funds enable agile, innovative solutions to climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. Learn how to support UNEP to invest in people and planet.

The Sectoral Solution to the climate crisis

UNEP is at the forefront of supporting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2°C, and aiming for 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To do this, UNEP has developed the Sectoral Solutions, a roadmap to reducing emissions across sectors in line with the Paris Agreement commitments and in pursuit of climate stability. Key sectors identified are: energy; industry; agriculture and food; forests and land use; transport; and buildings and cities.

Transmission-Scale Energy Storage Incentive Program to Reach 2,000 MW of Energy Storage by 2030 – One of the Most Ambitious Targets in the Nation

Legislation Will Nearly Double Clean Energy Capacity, Reducing Electric Bill Costs

LAWRENCEVILLE – Governor Phil Murphy today signed into law S4530/A5768 and A5267/S4289 as part of the Murphy Administration’s ongoing commitment to addressing the regional energy cost crisis by putting New Jersey on a path to nearly double its capacity to deliver affordable, reliable, and renewable energy by 2030. This legislation will facilitate the swift expansion of solar access for 450,000 additional New Jerseyans, including 250,000 low-income families, which will enable the equivalent of one million households to receive solar power by 2028. These bills will also help lower energy costs by vastly accelerating the construction of energy storage facilities across the state. The Governor was joined by legislative sponsors, local leaders, union members, and advocates at IBEW Local 269 in Lawrenceville.

S4530/A5768 directs the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to open registration by October 1, 2025 for an additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar projects. This will mark a massive expansion of New Jersey’s nation-leading solar programs and help hardworking families and businesses save money on their monthly electric bills.

A5267/S4289 establishes a transmission-scale energy storage incentive program to achieve New Jersey's goal of 2,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030. The program seeks to rapidly install new clean energy capacity and reduce costs for New Jersey’s energy customers.

In an effort to provide necessary energy alternatives, these pieces of legislation allow for the rapid expansion of New Jersey’s community solar program and swift creation of new energy storage facilities. Solar capacity has increased from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts under the Murphy Administration, with solar currently powering the equivalent of over 600,000 homes.

“Today, we are taking immediate and far-reaching steps to lower energy costs for every household in New Jersey,” said Governor Murphy. “By accelerating the process for bringing new sources of energy online and rapidly building new energy storage facilities, we will meet growing demand while also making life more affordable for our state’s families. As part of this process, we are going to create good-paying, union jobs and build a cleaner, more resilient future for every New Jerseyan.”

""I want to thank Governor Murphy for his leadership in advancing clean power solutions for New Jersey,"" said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. ""This legislation addresses real problems. More New Jerseyans will get access to the benefits of expanded community solar programs—one of the best ways for residents to lower their utility bills while contributing to clean energy in the Garden State. And large-scale battery storage will strengthen our electric grid and keep the lights on when we need it most. This is how we build a grid that works for everyone.""

The two bills signed today build upon the Murphy Administration’s ongoing efforts to mitigate rising energy costs due to mismanagement by regional grid operator PJM.

Dive Brief:

Social media giant Meta will partner with solar and community energy infrastructure company Silicon Ranch to bring a 100-megawatt solar farm to South Carolina to help power Meta’s data center in the state, Silicon Ranch announced Tuesday.

Silicon Ranch is making a $100 million investment in Orangeburg County, South Carolina, and Meta will receive all of the renewable energy credits from the facility, according to the release. The project will require no community or utility investments, Silicon Ranch told ESG Dive Tuesday.

The solar farm is expected to come online in 2027, the same year as Meta’s data center in Aiken, South Carolina. Meta said recently it successfully piloted the use of mass timber to construct an administration building on the future data center’s Aiken campus.

Dive Insight:

Meta — owner of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — is one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy and has reported net-zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions since 2020, primarily by matching its data center energy use with renewables over that span, according to its 2024 environmental report.

The deal is the 18th between Silicon Ranch and Meta, which collectively represent “well over 1,500 MW of renewable energy capacity” and $2.5 billion in investments from Silicon Ranch, according to the announcement. The partnerships include energy infrastructure projects in Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and the new South Carolina solar farm. Silicon Ranch, which is based in Nashville, Tennessee, told ESG Dive that not all of the projects have been publicly announced.

“This deal reflects the fact that an all-of-the-above energy strategy is necessary to power our growing economy,” Silicon Ranch said in an email. “Today, our country needs more energy than ever before, and we can do so in a way that supports American manufacturing, strengthens our infrastructure, and brings jobs and investment to rural communities.”

Central Electric Power Cooperative, a Columbia, South Carolina, energy generation and transmission cooperative, is also a partner in the deal and will purchase energy from the solar farm for its member portfolio, the release said. Central Electric represents 19 electric distribution cooperatives across the state, including Aiken Electric Cooperative, which will serve Meta’s data center.

For Meta, the deal follows a July announcement to purchase all of the energy generated by a 600 MW solar plant being built in Texas by Enbridge. Alberta-based Enbridge announced a $900 million investment to complete the project, which is also expected to come online in 2027.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/VWRRXeNbd7U5ZX-d4HIaYBttZI8gYMOfwnWcpwpZVcc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9NZXRhX0VVYzdpbDkuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-22 12:09:53.077281

The survey received institutional review board (IRB) approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr 2021-00980). YouGov, the firm we contracted with to do the survey, obtained informed consent from respondents before administering it.

Data collection and survey details

The data were collected from interviews administered online via computers, mobile phones or tablets in each country by YouGov. YouGov is one of the major international survey firms that routinely administers surveys for major media outlets such as CBS News, the Economist magazine and the (London) Times newspaper. The countries were selected to have both local EfD research centres and accessible YouGov panels. The countries chosen income-wise span a range from the lower end of low-to-middle-income countries (Nigeria) to the low end of high-income countries (Chile). They come from three continents and include six of the 20 largest global south countries. They include exporters of agriculture, minerals, oil and consumer goods.

Respondents were selected from YouGov’s country-specific panels covering individuals 18 years or older with internet access. Respondents received YouGov’s standard incentive for participation. Additional information on YouGov samples, IRB approval and the text of specific questions relied on can be found in the Supplementary Information, which also compares this approach with recent work9,10 that has some similarities in terms of purpose and method.

YouGov administered the survey online in April and May of 2023 using respondents selected from their country-specific opt-in panels. YouGov’s treatment of online panel issues is concisely defined in its responses to the set of 37 questions Esomar.org (European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research) considers important in assessing the results from such surveys40. To be eligible for inclusion, individuals had to be above 18 and have regular access to the internet at the time of the survey (for example, cell phone, computer or tablet). The fraction eligible to complete the survey varies across countries. Information from YouGov when the sampling weights were developed shows the fractions to be 76% in Chile, 59% in Colombia, 63% in India, 17% in Kenya, 64% in Nigeria, 54% in South Africa and 70% in Vietnam. Alternative sources put some of these fractions higher. We report two such sources here (Digital: January Report 2023 and World Bank: November 2023). These are for Chile (90.2%, 90.8%), Colombia (75.7%, 72.1%), India (48.7%, 51.5%), Kenya (32.7%, 29.0%), Nigeria (55.4%, 55.0%), South Africa (72.3%, 78.0%) and Vietnam (79.1%, 76.2%). These numbers are generally higher, particularly for countries with lower per-capita incomes. These estimates reflect increased internet/mobile phone penetration over time and may count some mobile phones on which it is not possible to answer a survey like ours.

Characteristics of the internet-connected population were drawn from the following sources, which used large high-quality country-wide random probability samples: Latin American Public Opinion Project 2021 (Chile and Colombia), the Pew Global Attitudes Survey 2017 (Vietnam), the Pew Global Attitudes Survey 2019 (India) and the Afrobarometer survey 2019 (Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa). This sampling frame tends to be skewed towards both male and younger respondents. Within YouGov panels, a propensity score approach utilizing age and gender is used to mirror the sampling frame characteristics.

Across countries, the sample median age is 31 years; it ranges from 40 in Chile to 27 in Nigeria. The male percentage is 55.4. This percentage exhibits more variability. At the low end are Vietnam (49.6) and Chile (49.8 male), while at the high end are Nigeria (56.6) and India (68.3). The demographic characteristics of the country-specific samples are relatively close to the characteristics of YouGov sampling frame for age and gender, so the weighted and unweighted analysis results are quite similar. We report only the unweighted results.

Summary demographic statistics for each country’s sample and the combined sample are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Supplementary Table 2 compares our sample to both the reference surveys used as sampling frames and to World Bank data on five age categories and gender. Generally, our samples are fairly close to their reference surveys’ values for the internet-enabled population. By contrast, comparison with the World Bank estimates shows a substantially larger fraction of the adult in the 55 and over age category in the general population than our sample, which is not unexpected. India, Kenya, Nigeria and, to a lesser extent, Colombia, show a smaller female fraction than the World Bank’s general population estimate.

Surveys interviewing those under 18 are treated very differently by the IRB approval processes. Thus, YouGov and other survey organizations must use results from rare, full probability-based samples that use in-person interviews to obtain their baseline demographics. Academic access to these surveys is possible, but they are not generally publicly available. For example, Pew’s 2019 Global Values Survey in India has one of the lower internet access fractions. Hence, it may be less representative of the general population than most of our global south countries. In Pew’s 2019 Global Values Survey, the median age in the raw data is 39, while in our survey, the median age is 31. The percentage of females in the raw Pew data is 42.49 versus 31.67 of Indians in our sample with internet access. For income, the Pew survey uses ten brackets. The average of these brackets for those with internet access is 5.9, while it is 4.5 for those without. The largest divergence occurs in the lowest income bracket. In the Pew survey, 54.65% of those with internet access in India live in rural villages or on farms versus 69.18% of those without internet access.

As survey inclusion requires internet access, our respondents are likely to be more urban, better educated and have higher incomes, although there is considerable variation in the sample on these characteristics. It is important to interpret results in this context. Full-probability random samples of the general population using dwelling unit enumeration and in-person interviewing have become increasingly rare in academic research owing to prohibitive cost. They are now largely the domain of government statistical agencies. Survey researchers have turned to alternative less complete sampling frames from which they can draw random samples. Their properties have been changing over time. For instance, random digit dialling of phone landlines could reach over 90% of the US population in the early 2000s, but under 30% today. The penetration of internet access has increased its use in surveys as they become increasingly representative of a country’s general population. Typically, there are not extremely large differences between those with internet access and those without, but some substantive divergences are common, which calls for caution in making conclusions for the entire population, even when it may be the best or only available estimate. A considerable effort in assembling and recruiting members for internet panels and sampling from those panels is underway in the survey research. Major internet panel suppliers, such as YouGov, which is used here, are quite transparent about the procedures used to counter a proliferation of web-based surveys based on highly selected convenience samples that are not representative of any well-defined broad-based sampling frame40.

The survey was available to respondents in English as well as other major country-specific languages. In Chile and Colombia, this was Spanish; in India, Hindi; in South Africa, Afrikaans and Zulu; and in Vietnam, Vietnamese. In Kenya and Nigeria, the official language is English. YouGov staff translated our survey instrument into these alternative languages. Researchers at the local EfD Research Centers checked that the translation was adequate for the local context, and recommended changes were incorporated into the YouGov translation drafts. Screenshots of the English version of the survey questions are contained in the Supplementary Information.

We use Stata 17 for analysis, and figures were drawn using Excel 365.

Elicitation via best–worst scaling and analysis via rank-ordered logit

Several survey questions deployed utilize a best–worst elicitation format using type 1 (object-level) data20. Effectively, respondents are presented with a list of objects, in our case, climate information sources, programme areas, health problems, climate policy statements or uses of fuel tax or carbon tax revenue. Best–worst scaling provides simple ways to summarize responses when the respondent provides only their most preferred (given the criterion) choice and their least preferred choice from the list. Often, these items are formulated in terms of most and least, where the descriptor might be agreement or priority. The order of the items in each set should be, and is here, randomized across respondents the first time presented.

With three items, a single best–worst question provides a complete ranking of the items. With an odd number of items, repeated application of the best–worst format removes the items previously selected as best and worst each time until only one item in the middle is left. One replication uniquely rank orders five items and two replications uniquely rank orders seven items. With up to seven items, it is common to repeat the original best–worst question, each time taking away the items chosen best or worst in the previous round (for example, see the analysis represented in Tables 3 and 5). Respondents see all items, and they provide a complete ranking of items in the set.

Beyond seven items, a random subset of items is generally presented to respondents, with different respondents receiving different subsets following an experiment design. This results in incomplete rank-ordered data because respondents either do not see all the items or are not asked to provide information that completely ranks them. The analysis displayed in Table 6 relies on assigning random subsets each with 5 (out of the 13) items. Random assignment to these subsets ensures statistically equivalent subsamples receive each of the distinct subsets defined by the experimental design. Here, a Youden41 square design based on incomplete blocks is used to ensure that each item is contained in an equal number of subsets and that each item appears an equal number of times with every other item in the master set.

The analysis in Table 4 is based on a set of ten climate policy statements. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two blocks (subsets) of seven statements and then asked to rank the items in their block using a sequence of best–worst questions. The two blocks of seven statements have four common items, each having three unique items. This allows the two sets of statements to be combined in a model that estimates parameters for nine alternative-specific constants, with one normalized to zero. This then allows the rank ordering of all ten items with the common four items anchoring the ranking exercise.

Another way to obtain partially rank-ordered data is to ask respondents to effectively divide items in a list into separate subsets based on a criterion. This is done for the analysis displayed in panel A of Table 2, where respondents are asked which 3 out of 12 climate information sources they are paying the most and least attention to. (This exercise is repeated for panel B of Table 2 using the criterion of trust.) This produces three subsets; the three best items are ranked above six of the unchosen item subset, which in turn are considered higher ranked than the worst three-item subset. Within a subset, each of the items is considered tied. Data of this sort are less informative (27 implied unique binary comparative rankings) than a complete ranking (66 implied binary comparisons) but more informative in some ways than multinomial choice data where only the top-ranked item is known (11 binary comparisons).

A complete ranking order of items in terms of a specified criterion can be represented in several different ways. Assume three items: a, b, c and d. There are 24 possible permutations for example, a > c > d > b}. Any permutation implies a set of pair comparisons for example, {a > c}, {a > d}, {a > b}, {c > d}, {c > b}, {d > b}. These pairs can be stacked with indicator variables representing the items serving as alternative specific constant terms and a binary logit model fit. With data on the rank order for each respondent, the parsimonious representation is the rank-ordered logit model42. This is a standard member of the class of random utility model where each of the ith respondent’s j choice alternatives is assumed to have utility Uij = Vij + εij, with Uij chosen (ranked) over another alternative, Uij*, if its value is larger. Vij is known as the systematic component, usually parameterized in terms of a vector k observables, X, and corresponding estimable preference parameters βjk. εij is the unobserved random component. Its standard deviation, σ, describes how utility is distributed around the systematic component. εij is typically assumed to have a Gumbel distribution, with the difference between two Gumbel draws having a logistic distribution.

A statistical equivalent model can be formed by stacking the implied set of multinomial comparisons, for example {a > c, d, b}, {c > d, b}, {d > b} fit with a conditional/multinomial logit model or by stacking the set of implicit binary comparisons fit with a binary discrete choice model43. This model is known to reproduce market shares or ranks when fit only to a set of alternative specific constants (indicator variables) used to represent the items in the choice set. In this case, the estimable preference parameters are simply one βj/σ for each choice alternative in the set, other than one for the base reference item normalized to zero. The rank order of the parameters on the alternative specific constants is the same as the predicted average rank ordering for the sample.

Choice model parameters are identified only in a relative sense because multiplying by a positive constant does not alter the implied choice behaviour. In practice, normalization is usually done via the unobserved scale factor σ, so the actual model parameters are expressed as βj/σ. The rank order of the estimated βj/σ provides the expected rank ordering of a randomly chosen sample respondent, with dispersion within the sample around this pattern being a function of σ. Swait and Louviere44 show that, while σ is not identified, the relative difference across two samples (for example, σ2/σ1) is identifiable. The same principle can be used to identify within sample differences with covariates such as gender or educational categories by effectively creating subsamples.

The rank-ordered model can be fit, as we do here (Stata 17, cmrologit), using the underlying likelihood function of a Cox-proportional hazard model where a higher value for an alternative is formally equivalent to a higher hazard rate of failure45. The rank-order logit model assumes among j = 1, …, J alternatives, the probability, π1, that alternative 1 is ranked higher than the other J alternatives can be expressed using

$${{\rm{P}}}_{1}={\rm{Prob}}\{{{{V}}}_{1}{ > }\,{\max }({{{V}}}_{2},\ldots ,{{{V}}}_{{{J}}})\}=\exp ({{{V}}}_{1}){/}\sum _{{{J}}}\exp ({{{V}}}_{{{j}}}).$$

Incompletely rank-ordered data require additional assumptions. If the source of the incomplete ranking is the division into subsets (Table 2), the associated assumption involves the treatment of tied ranks. Following Allison and Christakis45, tied ranks are handled by the marginal-likelihood method, which specifies that all strict preference orderings consistent with the stated weak preference ordering are equally likely. For those involving the presentation of different subsets of items to different respondents, the key assumption, met here via random assignment, is that each subset of items is seen by a statistically equivalent subsample of respondents. There is a further issue that involves how to link blocks of items together. Here, we use either a second-order randomization (for example, the Youden designs pairing of occurrence frequencies) for the Table 6 analysis or the inclusion of common alternatives in the two-block design underlying the Table 4 analysis.

Note that we estimate separate models for each country, so the scale parameter is potentially different in each of our c = 1, …, 7 countries. The implication of this is that the estimated βj/σc are not directly comparable across countries unless the σc are constant across countries. They are, however, comparable within a country given the distributional assumption for the random component. The restriction that the σc are the same across our countries can be tested in a straightforward way by estimating a model that includes a complete set of country-by-item interactions in a single model, which effectively restricts the scale factor to have a common value. Taking the model in Table 6 as an example, the likelihood ratio test follows a chi-square distribution with 6 degrees of freedom (95% critical value 12.592) because the Table 6 model allows six free country-specific scale factors compared with one in the restricted model. The likelihood ratio test statistic is 119.002 (P < 0.001), suggesting that restriction is strongly rejected. In thinking about this rejection, it is important to recognize that allowing for country-specific σc enables each country to have a different distribution of preferences around its average rank ordering. One way to view the importance of allowing for these country specific-scale factors is to note that the South African logistic regression coefficients are, on average, almost three times larger than those from India, yet remain highly correlated with them (0.67). This suggests reasonable similarity of priorities on average, but much greater preference heterogeneity in India than South Africa.

Note that rank-ordered data suffer the same type of indeterminacy without some type of normalization. For example, a variable containing ranks between 1 and 7 can be multiplied by any positive integer with the items still being ordered in an identical fashion. Whether decreasing or increasing rank order indicates more or less preferred can also be arbitrarily specified. Here, we use one of the standard conventions: a rank of ‘1’ indicates the most preferred item in a set.

A press release from USDA notes specific funding programs can no longer be used for wind and solar projects. The action, the release said, furthers the department’s goal to end taxpayer support of “unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and ensure the supply chain consists of American products and manufacturing.”

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in the release the changes will also stop the loss of prime farmland to solar fields. According to the release, the number of solar panels on U.S. farmland has increased by more than 50% since 2012.

Rollins said beginning farmers have a more difficult time entering the agricultural market when they also have to compete with solar projects for land.

“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Rollins said. “It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage.”

Scale in Iowa

USDA defines prime farmland as land with the “best combination” of characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops. This land must also be available for these uses, per the definition.

According to the Clean Grid Alliance, about 17.5 million acres of Iowa’s 30 million acres of farmland are considered prime agricultural ground.

The Clean Grid Alliance analyzed data from USDA and the power grid for the central U.S. and found that if all of the proposed solar projects in Iowa were built on only prime farmland, it would occupy 0.2% – or about 35,000 acres – of prime farmland in the state.

The alliance report shows in 2025, Iowa had 677 megawatts of solar online, and on about 5,755 acres of land. A view of active, utility scale solar projects in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, power grid shows Iowa has fewer solar projects than surrounding states in the MISO power grid.

Rollins’ announcement also noted solar panels manufactured by “foreign adversaries” could not be used in USDA projects. Rollins said again in a press release Thursday that foreign-made solar panels would not be allowed in USDA projects. This separate release directed agencies to prioritize land use efficiency in power generation projects on National Forest System lands.

According to a 2022 report from the International Energy Agency, China “dominates” solar manufacturing and accounts for more than 80% of the share in all manufacturing stages for solar panels.

The USDA initiative would target the Business and Industry program and the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, both of which are under USDA Rural Development.

Per the press release, wind and solar projects are no longer eligible under the Business and Industry program.

Recipients of REAP must ensure any wind or solar installations are “right-sized for their facilities.” The release specifies that ground mount solar photovoltaic systems must be smaller than 50 kilowatts and be able to record historical energy use to remain eligible under the REAP program.

USDA did not detail how it would judge location or solar panel origin as it relates to these programs.

Clean energy advocates say the action restricts farmers’ choices

Andy Olsen, the senior policy advocate for Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a statement that USDA’s claim to protect farmland was “dubious.”

Olsen said commercial development and data centers are “legitimate threats” to American farmland, while wind and solar projects can “coexist successfully with crops or grazing.”

Olsen argued the REAP program gave farmers and rural businesses “greater freedom” to care for their operations. The program has been used for things like rooftop solar on small businesses or on top of hog barns. Other grants have helped with energy efficiency upgrades at farms and rural businesses.

ISU, Alliant Energy solar farm caretakers showcase agrivoltaics results

“Any conversation around protecting farmland should come from thoughtful, balanced input, not blanket restrictions that strip choices from the very people REAP was designed to serve,” Olsen said in a statement.

REAP was established in the 2008 Farm Bill, and funding for the program increased substantially under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Olsen also said solar and wind projects give farmers the ability to generate energy on their own and to create additional revenue streams.

According to Clean Grid Alliance, Iowa farmers and landowners receive $4.3 million, annually in land-lease payments for solar projects.

The fact sheet from the alliance also notes solar pays significantly more per acre than traditional row crops. According to its data, solar can generate a production value of $11,068 per acre, annually, for farmers. Corn, by contrast, has a per acre production value of about $930. These figures are dependent on the price of electricity and on corn.

Some larger-scale solar projects in Iowa are managed and run by utility companies, including the 150 megawatt Wever Solar Project, operated by Alliant Energy in Lee County.

And the reason why (the fossil-fuel industry is getting so many concessions) is their terror at this dramatic shift in solar power.
There’ll be thousands of people opening their homes to their neighbors to show them their solar panels, their heat pumps.","Environmentalist Bill McKibben considers himself a big fan of “Brother Sun,” as his ecological spiritual ancestor, Saint Francis, termed earth’s star in his famous canticle.

Often considered the godfather of the contemporary environmental movement, McKibben’s new book, Here Comes the Sun, argues solar power is no longer an “alternative fuel” but has outpaced fossil fuels as the cheapest and most efficient way to generate power for humanity’s needs.

The key now, he says, is to propel the rising solar power movement forward despite massive resistance from the fossil-fuel industry and its political enablers.

In a recent interview, McKibben spoke about the new book and the coming Sun Day observance, scheduled on the autumnal equinox Sept. 21 to promote the transition to solar and wind power from fossil fuels.

Cynthia Astle: I was bowled over by all you describe in the book, the facts and figures about the rise of solar and wind power in terms of manufacturing and efficiency. How do you keep track of all of that?

Bill McKibben: I think your reaction is the reaction of most people, including many who think of themselves as environmentalists. We’ve stuck this kind of energy in a place in our heads that we’ve labeled “alternative energy” for 40 years now, and I think it was very hard for people to realize that it had broken out of that and become the most obvious mainstream.

The analogy I keep using is we’re used to thinking of it as the Whole Foods of energy, when in fact, it’s now the Costco of energy. It’s cheap, it’s available in bulk, it’s on the shelf now.

A couple of years ago, I noticed an acceleration, almost mind-bending acceleration, in the pace at which (solar power) was happening. Sometime about five years ago we crossed some invisible line, when it became cheaper to generate power from the sun and the wind than from burning coal and gas and oil.

“Sometime about five years ago we crossed some invisible line, when it became cheaper to generate power from the sun and the wind than from burning coal and gas and oil.”

That was a very epochal moment for human civilization. I mean, it allows us to imagine ending the long-running human practice of combustion and replacing it with power directly from the sun. But it’s such a big change that I think it’s hard for us to completely wrap our minds around. It’s much easier if you’re out traveling in the rest of the world, especially if you’ve had the chance to be in China in recent years where it’s obvious what’s going on. But truthfully, the same thing is true in California in the past 18 months. It’s true in the Lone Star state where the acceleration of sun, wind and battery power is now the defining feature of energy across that region.

Astle: That’s all been impressive on the macroeconomic scale, but for some folks, including a lot of church folks, the upfront cost of getting (solar) panels on your roof is still almost prohibitive.

McKibben: This was the problem (President Joe) Biden was addressing with the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) and now (President Donald) Trump has repealed the IRA. If you want to access the federal 30% tax credit, you need to install your solar system before midnight on New Year’s Eve. And if you want to access the federal tax credits for electric vehicles, you need to buy them before the end of September.

These were programs designed to last 10 years and to help America catch up with the rest of the world on (solar power). But at least for the moment our government has decided not to do that. So now with Washington not helping, we need to figure out other ways to keep bringing the cost down.

In America, it costs about three times as much to put up solar panels as it does in Australia or the EU. This is not because the panels cost more, although with tariffs that’ll be a little part of the problem. It costs much more because we have these excessive permitting requirements unlike any others in the world.

“It shouldn’t be much harder to get a solar panel on your roof than it should be to put a new refrigerator in your kitchen.”

America has about 15,000 jurisdictions, cities, towns, counties, and they each have their own rules, and they all send out inspectors — which in this case is unnecessary. It shouldn’t be much harder to get a solar panel on your roof than it should be to put a new refrigerator in your kitchen.

If you’re living in Spain or in Australia, you can call up this Wednesday afternoon, order solar panels for your roof, and they’ll be installed and producing power by Monday afternoon. For instance, in Europe in the last few years, there’s been a big surge in what they call balcony solar.

Astle: Yes, I’ve read about that. I’ve seen pictures of those panels. That’s exciting, but we can’t get that here.

McKibben: That’s the thing. It’s illegal in most of this country, completely unnecessarily. But the exception to that is the quite “red” state of Utah where the state legislature this spring unanimously passed enabling legislation because a libertarian state senator said, “Why can you do this in Frankfurt and Hamburg, but not in Salt Lake City and Provo?”

Nobody had a good answer. So now it’s legal in Utah, and people are (installing balcony solar panels). That’s another thing we’re pushing for because apartment dwellers should have the same ability to take part in this revolution as homeowners.

Astle: How can we faithfully advocate for solar amid all that’s going on to roll back the renewable energy movement?

McKibben: A way of saying this is, if renewable energy was not important, then the fossil fuel industry would not have spent so much time and money making sure they helped win the last election. California, which is the fourth largest economy in the world, now has put up so many solar panels that they’re using 40% less natural gas to produce electricity than they did two years ago. To me, that’s a wonderful statistic. But if you run an oil company, that’s a terrifying statistic; it’s huge.

You may remember about this time last year, presidential candidate Trump told oil executives if they gave him a billion dollars, they could get anything they wanted once he was president. They put up about half a billion between lobbying and campaign donations and advertising last year. That, I guess, is enough because they’re getting everything they wanted.

And the reason why (the fossil-fuel industry is getting so many concessions) is their terror at this dramatic shift in solar power. They know they can’t really compete straight up with clean, cheap, renewable energy; they’re gaming the political system to allow them to.

There was an interesting test of that in your state (Texas) earlier this year.

Astle: I remember that! Farmers and ranchers overwhelmed the legislature (when it tried to slow down solar power installations).

McKibben: That’s right. They all descended on Austin and said, “Do not do this.” That was a very powerful moment. It’s large parts of rural America — I’ve lived my whole life in rural America — that are very much in favor of (solar power) because it’s a great boon to communities to have these projects that produce a lot of tax revenue right close to home.

Astle: In times like this, when we’ve hit this roadblock, do you ever despair?

McKibben: Well, yes, sometimes, but those are moments when having a faith practice is a good thing. I think Christians are allowed to hope that if we do all we can, the world will meet us halfway.

That’s different from just trusting that everything will work out because God will make it so. I do not believe that. I believe we’re called to do all we can.

But yes, it’s a very depressing moment, not only politically, but because we can see the big signs of climate change now at work on the planet. The ways the Gulf Stream and the Jet Stream are now flickering and faltering. The fact that we see what it means to have heated the air so that it can hold more water and produce more flooding. You had a horrible instance of that in the (Texas) Hill Country last month. Those things do depress me and sometimes lead me to despair. But we’re allowed to think that if we do everything we can, there’s some other force in this world that will answer to that.

And I love the idea that sort of in Hollywood fashion, renewable energy is riding to the rescue at exactly the last possible moment. We know from the beginning of the Good Book that one of the first things the Good Lord saw fit to do was hang a large ball of burning gas 93 million miles up in the sky. And he’s given us the wit to learn how to make full use of it, which I love. I mean, energy from heaven, not from hell. That’s my mantra.

Astle: What would you most like people of faith to understand about Sun Day and its implications for the movement?

McKibben: A couple of things.

People around America need to do this work I was describing earlier of making it clear that (solar power) is no longer “alternative energy,” that there’s nothing strange or scary or complicated about it. There’ll be thousands of people opening their homes to their neighbors to show them their solar panels, their heat pumps. There’ll be parades of EVs and e-bikes.

“The advent of clean energy represents the single greatest possibility for rapid development and poverty alleviation we’ve ever seen.”

And I hope we’re able to jumpstart the effort to persuade cities and states to make it much easier to do this work. Washington obviously isn’t going to be much help in the next couple of years. They’ve been captured by the fossil-fuel industry. But that doesn’t mean lots of cities and states can’t do impressive things. So, I’m hopeful we can get a lot of permitting reform and legal changes under way.

Astle: Is there anything we haven’t touched on that you think is important for people to know?

McKibben: One of the things that has always animated a lot of my fellow parishioners and me is a sense of responsibility to the poorest parts of the world.

On the one hand, climate change represents the single greatest threat to the poor world there’s ever been. The toll now of flood and fire and drought is assuming almost impossible dimensions.

On the other hand, the advent of clean energy represents the single greatest possibility for rapid development and poverty alleviation we’ve ever seen. Eighty percent of people in the world live in countries that must import fossil fuel. For those countries, that’s often the reason they’re so far in debt and they can’t afford hospitals and schools.

I was just looking at the numbers for India; they spend the equivalent of 5% of their GDP — 5% of the entire economy — buying oil from overseas. They don’t need it (fossil fuels) because they have plenty of sunshine and plenty of wind. So really the greatest development effort we could ever do, the most powerful way to love one’s neighbor we could put into practice, would be to help them quickly build out the renewable energy capacity they need.

The same thing is true for poor communities and people in this country, but it’s especially obvious when you look at the poorest countries in the world. Remember, there’s almost a billion people on this planet who have no electricity at all right now.

For me, this is probably the single most interesting project Christians can be engaged in right now. The Good Lord was kind enough to hang this big ball of burning gas up there, and it’s a shame that we let it go to waste day after day after day after day. The sun already gives us light; it already gives us warmth. It already allows us to have photosynthesis, and now it’s willing to give us all the power we could ever want. We should thank God for that.",https://baptistnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WM_Uganda2017_SSheridan-401-copy.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 21:05:02.120070

“By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.
“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump’s post.
Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.
Trump administration polices that emphasize fossil fuels are “an extremely backward force in this conversation,” Quigley said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — With electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, President Donald Trump has lashed out at renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, blaming them for skyrocketing energy costs.

Trump called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.

Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans’ electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.

Advocates say renewables provide the extra energy needed

“Now more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,” said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The GOP bill will cost thousands of jobs and impose higher energy costs nationwide, Heinrich and other critics said.

A report from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family’s energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. “By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.

Renewable advocates were more blunt.

“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump’s post.

“Farmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,” the group added.

As technology improves, wind and solar offer some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy, said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, another industry group.

States with the highest share of clean energy production have seen prices decline in the past year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while prices have gone up in states with the least renewable energy use.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Trump administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Grumet said

“Blocking cheap, clean energy while doubling down on outdated fossil fuels makes no economic or environmental sense,” added Ted Kelly, director of U.S. clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices

Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.

“That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office,” Wright told POLITICO during a visit to Iowa last week. About 60 percent of the state’s electricity comes from wind.

Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have “an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phase-out of the tax credits” approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.

Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,” Grassley said in a statement.

John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Republican tax law will increase U.S. power bills by slowing construction of solar, wind, and battery projects and could eliminate as many as 45,000 jobs by 2030.

Trump administration polices that emphasize fossil fuels are “an extremely backward force in this conversation,” Quigley said. “Besides ceding the clean energy future to other nations, we are paying for fossil foolishness with more than money — with our health and with our safety. And our children will pay an even higher price.”

Naperville is one of a few dozen communities that receives their electricity through a co-operative agency. The city’s contract is set to expire in 2035, but the agency is asking them to sign on until 2050. Jess, can you explain what’s going on in Naperville?

Jess Savage: Right. The Illinois Municipal Electric Agency manages the energy profile of communities like Naperville. These communities collectively own power sources, like solar, wind and coal projects. They all, including Naperville, have partial ownership of two coal power plants in southern Illinois and Kentucky, and they receive about 70% of their electricity from these plants.

JD: Walk us through why this contract extension has been so controversial.

JS: There is a lot of opposition to this contract wholesale. Students led a protest outside the building leading up to the meeting, arguing that coal has no place in Naperville.

The Naperville Environment and Sustainability Task Force, or NEST, and other activists have been working against this contract extension for years. They’re asking for the city to look at other options beyond IMEA, plus more opportunities for public input and time to decide. Here’s Ted Bourlard during public comments. He’s part of NEST’s leadership team.

""A decision of this magnitude is too important to be made with only a few voices at the table. We believe the wider community must be part of the process so all these questions and more can be answered.”

JD: So what was decided at the meeting?

JS: The council voted 7-2 to keep trying to work on this issue. In other words, they did not vote to sign the contract as is. And the mayor proposed major changes to it. Other council members suggested additional amendments, which will be voted on at the next meeting.

JS: Some residents want to stay with IMEA, arguing that it’s a stable source of energy. IMEA’s vice president of member services, Staci Wilson, told me why they’re looking to extend contracts.

“As our thermal resources are as they expire in the future, we would want to be replacing them with new renewable or carbon free resources. We need these extensions to be able to procure and to position our portfolio into the future.”

JD: What else stuck out to you at the meeting this week?

JS: I was struck by the level of engagement in the room. Dozens of people spoke in the public forum, many of them expressing gratitude for the work city council’s doing on this issue. But there was a tense moment when councilman Josh McBroom accused NEST of being disrespectful and overly political.

McBroom: If it was up to me, you would be stripped of your task force status at the city and, at the very minimum, you would owe an apology to the mayor and our professional city staff.

VOICE: Councilman, you are out of order.

It was the only time the gavel had to come down. NEST did not respond to request for comment about this exchange.

Trump called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.

Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans’ electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.

Advocates say renewables provide the extra energy needed

“Now more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,” said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The GOP bill will cost thousands of jobs and impose higher energy costs nationwide, Heinrich and other critics said.

A report from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family’s energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. “By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.

Renewable advocates were more blunt.

“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump’s post.

“Farmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,” the group added.

As technology improves, wind and solar offer some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy, said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, another industry group.

States with the highest share of clean energy production have seen prices decline in the past year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while prices have gone up in states with the least renewable energy use.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Trump administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Grumet said

“Blocking cheap, clean energy while doubling down on outdated fossil fuels makes no economic or environmental sense,” added Ted Kelly, director of U.S. clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices

Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.

“That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office,” Wright told POLITICO during a visit to Iowa last week. About 60 percent of the state’s electricity comes from wind.

Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have “an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phase-out of the tax credits” approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.

Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,” Grassley said in a statement.

John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Republican tax law will increase U.S. power bills by slowing construction of solar, wind, and battery projects and could eliminate as many as 45,000 jobs by 2030.

Trump administration polices that emphasize fossil fuels are “an extremely backward force in this conversation,” Quigley said. “Besides ceding the clean energy future to other nations, we are paying for fossil foolishness with more than money — with our health and with our safety. And our children will pay an even higher price.”

Solar is set to account for half of new electricity added to the grid in the United States this year, according to predictions from the Energy Information Administration.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.

Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.

In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half.

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.

Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.

Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers.

Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.

On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”

A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation.

Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed.

Trump policy prompts NV Energy to seek escape hatch for would-be clean energy transmitters

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement.

One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.

“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote.

In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA.

While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.

Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.

Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA.

In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled.

If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/nevada_current_articles_381/8488f39275b9d526ec8e9be347164862,N,,2025-08-22 14:04:50.308222

Burgum highlighted the administration's efforts to cut red tape and unleash innovation in American industry, particularly in coal and natural gas exports. He noted the necessity of reliable energy to compete in the AI arms race against China.

Addressing concerns about rising electricity prices linked to Biden-era policies favoring renewable energy, Burgum agreed with Energy Secretary Chris Wright's assessment. ""All of these projects, particularly offshore wind, would not exist without these massive taxpayer subsidies that were passed when Joe Biden was in office,"" Burgum said. He pointed out that some offshore projects rely heavily on tax subsidies rather than electrical generation, leading to higher costs in regions like the northeastern U.S.

Burgum also discussed the administration's efforts to reopen coal mines in Montana, Wyoming, and Utah, which he said had not happened for a decade. ""Extending the leases on federal land... helps us pay down the debt and the deficit,"" he said, stressing the importance of reliable energy for the national grid.

Still many predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods do not have green spaces within a five mile radius.
Since 2015, Project Petals has helped open 10 green spaces, ranging from a quarter of an acre (1,000 square meters) to five acres (20,200 square meters).
“In a place like New York, we are called the concrete jungle, (some) people don’t have access to green spaces at all,” White said.
In June, Institute launched a Latino Climate and Health Dashboard, which creates a centralized source that shows the climate disparities Latino neighborhoods across California.","Keith Lambert and his family cope with the extreme heat of summertime Chicago by going in and out of their house as quickly as possible and making sure their insulated shades are always drawn.

“It’s really just minimizing the exposure,” Lambert said. “It's about doing your best to manage your cooling touch points.”

Lambert is like tens of millions of Americans navigating major heat waves, with temperatures consistently exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius). More often than not, the heat hits hardest for people of color and low-income residents, although Lambert and his family consider themselves middle class.

“The reality is there is a financial tie as to your comfort level and your well-being when it comes to extreme heat conditions,"" Lambert said. ““If If you don’t have the means and or effort to cool, you have three choices you bake, you're suffering and dealing with it, or do the best to go out and find places that have air conditioning.”

Mortality records from cities across the country have shown that heat kills along socioeconomic and racial lines.

Environmental justice advocates trace this inequality back to decades of discriminatory housing policy, especially redlining — the 1930s government practice of rating neighborhoods’ investment worthiness using race as a determining factor and denying mortgages to minority buyers.

“The redlining and all of the historic environmental injustices that happens to black and brown communities in this country are now coming to a head because its impacting everyone,” said Alicia White, founder of Project Petals an environmental nonprofit that serves Black and brown communities.

""It's impacting our communities the most,” White said.

More green spaces needed

The extreme heat isn’t just uncomfortable; it’s the top cause of weather-related fatalities nationwide. According to a New York City mortality report, extreme heat kills an average of 350 New Yorkers each year. While heatwaves are “incredibly deadly,” according to Eric Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University, they are also “largely ignored.” Heat is invisible and makes for less spectacular imagery than hurricanes or floods.

“But also the people heatwaves affect are often made invisible in our public life,” said Klinenberg, the author of “Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.” “They’re disproportionately poor, Black and elderly. They often live in segregated neighborhoods.”

Environmentalists say one solution to beating the heat in sprawling cities is planting more trees, creating green spaces like parks and meadows and covering rooftops with plants.

In Arizona, the nonprofit Unlimited Potential, which focuses on promoting health and wellness, maintains a program to develop the urban forestry workforce to grow and maintain the tree canopy in Phoenix.

Tawsha Trahan, director of healthy communities at Unlimited Potential, said growing the tree canopy in Phoenix, especially in low-income neighborhoods is needed as the lack of trees contribute to their hotter temperatures.

“(There) are many reasons that contribute to having hotter neighborhoods but one of those reasons is they simply have much less trees,” Trahan said. “It's visual. You can drive around in a neighborhood and see a substantial difference with the tree canopy cover.”

Last fall, the New York City Council passed laws adding trees to the city charter’s sustainability plans and requiring the city to develop an urban forest plan to increase tree cover from 22 to 30 percent by 2035. Still many predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods do not have green spaces within a five mile radius.

White, the Project Petals founder, said her organization is working to change that by providing the communities with resources they need to create green spaces, such as community gardens. Since 2015, Project Petals has helped open 10 green spaces, ranging from a quarter of an acre (1,000 square meters) to five acres (20,200 square meters).

“These spaces really help to filter our air and they lower our temperature,"" White said.

But these spaces, like one in the Jamaica section of Queens with its abundant greenery, aren't just an area to cool down or find shade. They are a place where community can grow. White said you can often find residents and volunteers sitting down for conversation, finding a quiet space to read a book, studying for school and growing their own food.

“In a place like New York, we are called the concrete jungle, (some) people don’t have access to green spaces at all,” White said.

Fighting heat with data

With increasing temperatures and development patterns, experts say its only going to get hotter, unless something is done. Some are using data as a way to alert communities to the growing dangers.

For example, Kevin Lanza, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, is helping cities mitigate heat exposure at bus stops. Because Texas's communities of color rely heavily on public transportation systems, this increases their exposure to heat, Lanza said.

In 2019, Lanza's study found that the hottest days saw lower bus ridership. But when the bus stops were shaded by trees, the area was twice as cool and prevented steep ridership lost. The findings prompted the Houston transit authority, METRO and other agencies to begin work to redesign their bus stops to provide relief from the heat, Lanza said.

As of June, according to reporting from Houston Public Media, six shelters have been redesigned to allow more airflow, with more stops expected to be replaced over the next six months.

In 2023, Cap Metro, the transit authority in Austin, also used Lanza’s study to develop a plan to mitigate heat impacts by planting more tree across the city and near existing bus stops.

Climate dashboard helping Latino communities

Julia Silver, a lifelong resident of California, used to spend her summers with her family at an outdoor public pool. Now, amid record-breaking heat waves, Silver and her family have spent the majority of the summer inside their Los Angeles home, the local mall or other air-conditioned facilities.

“It’s just kind of become unbearable during those hot summer days to spend time outside,” said Silver, a researcher at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute.

In June, Institute launched a Latino Climate and Health Dashboard, which creates a centralized source that shows the climate disparities Latino neighborhoods across California. Developed with guidance from a statewide advisory committee of climate justice, public health, and data equity experts, the dashboard shows 90% of California's Latino population faces climate inequities, from higher air pollution to more days of extreme heat than white residents.

“The disparities shown in the dashboard are not random,” said Silver, a senior research analyst at the LLPI and the project’s leader.

Silver said the main purpose of the dashboard is to ensure local leaders, community groups, government agencies and others have access to trustworthy data that reflects the experience communities in California and so many other states are facing.

“The more climate change intensifies the more difficult it is for people to live, and the more dangerous it is for people to be outside,” Silver said.

The dashboard will help create a shift to more inclusive climate planning by helping organizations understand who is most affected and where the greatest needs are.

“By shining a light on these patterns, we can start correcting them,” said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, research faculty director at LPPI and principal investigator for the project.

Future Jaguar EV owners shouldn’t have to deal with any of this, though.","Jaguar I-Pace owners in the United States can now use Tesla Superchargers.

The move comes as more and more non-Tesla automakers are gaining access to Tesla’s ubiquitous DC fast charging network.

Recently, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) appeared on Tesla’s website as a supported automaker. But the only EV sold by the group in the U.S. was the I-Pace.

The Jaguar I-Pace, the British automaker’s first electric car and one of the first luxury crossover EVs in the world, can finally be recharged at Tesla Superchargers in the United States.

The change went into effect earlier this month after Tesla added Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to the list of automakers that can use the expansive Supercharger network of DC fast chargers. Back in 2023, Jaguar said owners of its sleek battery-powered EV would gain access to what is widely considered to be the best fast charging network in the U.S. in 2025. Now, access is finally open to the car group’s discontinued electric car, but owners find themselves in yet another conundrum.

The Jaguar I-Pace has several recalls related to battery fire risks under its belt.

“I'm flabbergasted that this has actually happened, considering the general poor support of the vehicle,” one user of the I-Pace Forum said earlier this month. As a reminder, Jaguar’s first EV, as cool as it looks, was riddled with reliability issues. No fewer than five recalls were issued in the U.S. to try and put an end to high-voltage battery fires. The problem was so big that Jaguar decided to buy back thousands of I-Paces from the 2019 model year.

Production of the four-door crossover ended late last year. Now, owners need to strike a delicate balancing act of using charging adapters that are not approved by Jaguar while hoping their cars won’t catch fire. Back in 2023, when Jaguar announced it would gain access to Tesla’s DC fast charging network, it said owners of older vehicles would get certified charging adapters.

That hasn’t happened yet, with one company representative saying in an email that there’s no word on when NACS to CCS1 adapters will be available for I-Pace owners. As a reminder, the I-Pace has a CCS1 charging port, while the vast majority of Tesla Superchargers have NACS charging cables. Thus, a charging adapter is needed.

The problem here is that if something were to go wrong during a charging session while using an adapter that’s not approved by the manufacturer, Jaguar might say that the warranty has been voided, leaving the owner to foot the entire repair bill. But there is no Jaguar-approved charging adapter yet.

Future Jaguar EV owners shouldn’t have to deal with any of this, though. The company’s upcoming models, starting with a luxury four-door sedan, will come with a NACS charging port from the factory in the U.S., making the use of adapters at Superchargers irrelevant. It will, however, introduce the need for a CCS1 to NACS adapter for stations that offer CCS1 charging cables–and there are a lot of them out there.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qkqA21/s1/jaguar-i-pace-gains-tesla-supercharger-access-in-the-united-states.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:08:09.600435

“Is this going to invert the company, moving away from these very profitable vehicles and being mostly a provider of $30,000 vehicles?","President Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for electric vehicles and is slamming the brakes on government incentives to get them into more driveways.

He’s been working to undo policies that promote clean technologies while increasing support for coal, oil, and natural gas. In particular, Trump has been working to reverse or halt programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, the single largest US government investment to deal with climate change, signed into law by his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying a new electric car, along with a $4,000 credit for used EVs and $40,000 for commercial EVs, is set to expire on September 30.

Those moves may have contributed to Trump’s messy split with Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla and former head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted on Truth Social in June.

More than 90 percent of new cars sold in the US are still gasoline-powered, and EV sales have recently seen a slowdown in the US following a years-long growth spurt. The looming rollback of federal incentives, along with inflation concerns, rising manufacturing costs from tariffs, and increasing competition over raw materials, have led carmakers to cut back on many of the enticements that have made electric cars a better buy.

Many car dealers have also been struggling to move EVs off their lots as customers remain worried about charging infrastructure and cost.

But despite all of these challenges, the popularity of EVs in the US is still growing, and some US automakers remain committed to running on electrons. And in other countries, EVs are racing ahead. More than half of new cars sold in China are electric or hybrids, backed by generous government subsidies. People clearly are willing to drive EVs — at the right price.

Last week, Ford announced that it was pouring $5 billion into building a new EV platform — a chassis and drivetrain for a suite of electric vehicles — in Louisville, Kentucky. The first vehicle rolling off the line will be a four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000. That would put it in line with some of the cheapest pickup trucks on the market today, electric or gasoline. And Ford aims to start deliveries in 2027, less than two years from now.

It’s an ambitious, risky bet in a volatile economy, but it’s a sign that, while electric vehicles may be slowing down in the US, automakers think they aren’t stopping and could accelerate again. It’s also good news for anyone concerned about rising greenhouse gas emissions, since transportation is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world.

Why Ford is betting big on a small price tag

This isn’t Ford’s first run at an electric pickup truck. In 2021, Ford debuted the F-150 Lightning, the fully electric version of its iconic Ford F-150, the best-selling pickup truck in the US for almost five decades. At times, Ford was selling 100 conventional F-150s per hour.

So, it made a lot of sense that Ford would want to build on that successful platform to go electric. And at first, it seemed like their bet was paying off. Interest was high, and its initial production run for the 2022 model year sold out. The F-150 Lightning was named the 2023 MotorTrend Truck of the Year. Rivals at General Motors and Stellantis (the parent company of Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler) responded by developing their own electric pickups. But Ford ran into issues with its battery suppliers while the auto industry as a whole hit supply chain snags during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lightning sales quickly hit a pothole, and Ford even paused production for a few months last year.

At the time, I argued that the Ford F-150 Lightning was not the EV America was waiting for. It was too expensive to be the mass market truck that would tip American drivers away from gasoline and toward batteries. The base model Lightning launched at close to $40,000, and the current base model is almost $50,000.

The Lightning was another entry in the US auto industry’s general trend of moving upmarket with bigger, pricier, and more profitable vehicles. Carveouts in fuel economy rules for trucks and SUVs have also contributed to vehicle bloat in recent decades.

The average new car price in the US has reached a record high of almost $50,000 in a country where the median household income is around $80,000. Even pickup trucks, which evoke a burly, working-class aesthetic, are often kitted out and priced like luxury cars. That means a lot of Americans are borrowing to buy them. The average new car payment is $745, and auto loans are the second-largest category of household debt.

Electrification adds another cost. Though electricity is cheaper than gasoline, the average EV has a higher sticker price than its gasoline counterpart. For some automakers, like Tesla and Rivian, this is part of their strategy. First, start by building a high-end vehicle, creating the supply chains and charging network to support it. Then, after achieving economies of scale, start building cheaper vehicles. But so far, carmakers have continued to make more expensive models and have been slow to release cheaper EVs.

Public EV chargers are also nowhere near as ubiquitous as gas stations, and the ones available haven’t always been reliable. The Trump administration halted $5 billion in funding for more EV chargers, but after a court injunction, it began to release the cash.

“The top barrier for [EV] adoption is price, and then infrastructure,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

So, now, Ford is following a different route.

The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

Its bet on a $30,000 truck is an inversion of the start-expensive-then-go-cheap strategy, and the company argues it’s a return to form. “Nearly 120 years ago, the Ford Model T became the ‘Universal Car.’ Why? It was affordable, adaptable, and serviceable,” wrote Ford CEO Jim Farley recently. “Now, we’re ushering in the next chapter with the Ford Universal EV Platform.”

Alan Baum, principal of Baum and Associates, a market research firm focused on the auto industry, noted that this isn’t necessarily a shift for the company, but rather, a foray into the global market and an often overlooked swath of potential buyers at home that US automakers have largely ceded to foreign brands.

The customers looking to buy a cheap truck aren’t cross-shopping for a fully tricked-out F-150. And the growing cult of the Kei truck, a variety of tiny, cheap, lightweight gray-market Japanese imports, is an indication that there’s an unfed appetite for small utility vehicles in the US.

“Is this something that can change the profitability for electric vehicles, where they have obviously come up well short of what their earlier plans were? Yes,” Baum said. “Is this going to invert the company, moving away from these very profitable vehicles and being mostly a provider of $30,000 vehicles? Absolutely not.”

Welcome to the no carrots, no sticks era of EVs

The other factor to consider is that, while the US is the land of big trucks, it isn’t the only place where people are buying them.

In the rest of the world, small, cheap cars are still in high demand. Some of the biggest growth markets are in places like southeast Asia, places with high gas prices, narrow roads, and a burgeoning middle class eager to get around. Inside the US, the government has used tariffs to keep Chinese electric carmakers like BYD off the interstate, but they’ve since become dominant in other countries. BYD is now the largest EV manufacturer in the world, while global EV sales are set to break new records this year and US carmakers are still trying to get out of the pit lane.

Meanwhile, massive markets like the European Union are still maintaining their environmental regulations, including a ban on the sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035.

So even with rollbacks of EV incentives and reversing regulations that promote cleaner vehicles in the US, carmakers are still facing a lot of pressure to make cleaner vehicles if they want to be competitive in the global market. And companies like Ford want to be competitive in the global market. The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

They’re also facing the added constraint of tariffs on materials like steel, aluminum, and rare earth metals. Ford said its new EV platform is aimed at exports as well as the domestic market and that critical components like batteries will be manufactured within the US without using critical minerals like nickel and cobalt.

The energy sector offers a useful parallel. Wind and solar power are now the main ways the world is adding more electricity to the power grid — not because of environmental regulations, but because it’s cheap and quick to get them up and running.

A lower price point is a stronger argument than any climate change bona fides. The words “environment,” “climate,” “carbon,” and “emissions” were conspicuously absent in Ford’s universal EV platform announcement. While the transition to cleaner vehicles is slowing, once EVs are cheaper and better than internal combustion cars, they will race ahead and take a commanding lead.

“The rest of the world’s going electric,” Valdez Streaty said. “I think we’ll continue to see that technology advancement, but definitely we have a lot of hurdles and bumps in the road right now.”",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Jim-Farley_Louisville-Assembly-Plant_Aug11_01.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.729057198914%2C100%2C78.541885602173&w=1200,N,,2025-08-22 12:08:22.606436

At the same time, Rivian’s future rides on the more affordable R2 crossover, and after that, the R3 and R3X hatchbacks.

But as Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe indicated in a recent interview with InsideEVs’ Plugged-In Podcast, the EV startup isn’t stopping there. He said the company’s engineers, designers and product planners are already starting to think about what could be done with a Rivian R4 and R5.

“There's actually a whole series of things that happen way before we get deep engineering of the vehicle, which is conceptualizing: what are the products?” Scaringe said on the podcast. “We have a design-engineering team that does a lot of this advanced work, and was already thinking about, ‘What is R2, what is R3?’, well before we had moved our full engineering team to work on those.”

Right now, Scaringe said, engineering work at Rivian is laser-focused on the R2, slated to debut next year with a $45,000 starting price, and the platform it uses. That platform will be significantly more advanced and cost-effective to make than even the current flagship R1 models, and it will also underpin the R3 and R3X.

Rivian R2 vs R1S

But then there's the question of what comes next. “We want a very small number of people thoughtfully defining some of those big decisions, like what's the personality of R4? What’s the size? What's the type of vehicle? What does it look like?” Scaringe said. “What is R5?”

While Scaringe declined to elaborate on what form an R4 and R5 could take, he did say they’d be related, potentially priced even more affordably than its next round of EVs and potentially on an entirely new platform than even the immediately upcoming cars.

“We contemplate [R4 and R5] as a sibling set, where you have two very different vehicles that share the same platform,” he said. “But it would be lower cost than even R2 or R3. But there's no engineering teams on those today. They’re very much conceptual.”

If their costs are low enough, then Rivian may just do what Tesla seems unwilling to do: become more of a full-line automaker, invested in making more mainstream EVs.

While analysts, investors and fans alike have called for Tesla to make a sub-$30,000 EV, such a project seems to be a point of contention with CEO Elon Musk. The world’s richest man says the company is all-in on artificial intelligence, robotics and robotaxis, not making more cars. Last year, Musk said he was opposed to a cheaper EV program that could share a platform with its planned Cybercab, saying a $25,000 EV “is pointless” because it’s human-driven rather than fully autonomous.

While Rivian continues to invest in autonomous driving technology in its own right, however, Scaringe’s comments indicated that the company is thinking about its EV future beyond the current lineup and the concepts that have been shown to the public. But he also indicated that Rivian won’t stray far from its current naming system. “We like the naming conventions. It's pretty simple,” Scaringe said of names like R4 and R5.

New Flyer of America (NFI) has unveiled an extended range for its Xcelsior CHARGE FC, a hydrogen fuel cell electric bus that now boasts up to 370 miles on a single refuel.

""New Flyer has been a pioneer in hydrogen fuel cell bus technology for decades and continues to push the boundaries of clean transit innovation,"" reported Hydrogen Central.

This is a major development towards the widespread adoption of electric vehicles across the private and public transport sectors. Range is a common point of anxiety when considering electric alternatives, yet the technology just keeps getting better.

""With zero-emission buses, range matters, and this upgrade is a game-changer,"" said Chris Stoddart, president of NFI's North American Bus and Coach sector, per Hydrogen Central.

This innovation places hydrogen-powered transit squarely at the center of clean, efficient urban travel — even in hilly, more remote areas like Humboldt County — offering a real alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles, which contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and urban pollution.

Unlike gas-powered vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles emit only water vapor. Not only does this slash emissions, but it also improves daily life by reducing air and noise pollution.

Additional benefits for riders and city denizens include a smoother, quieter experience. EV buses are so quiet, some national parks have introduced them not only to cut pollution, but to improve their birdwatching and wildlife sightseeing tours. These vehicles are less likely to scare off animals or disrupt the experience of natural wonders.

One major incentive for city governments to prioritize mobility solutions is that fuel cell vehicles cut maintenance costs, thanks to fewer moving parts and more efficient energy use. For commuters, that means efficiency and lower fares. For cities, it means major savings.

""Mobility solutions should work for every community, whether in rural counties or growing cities,"" said Jennifer McNeill, vice president of sales and Marketing at NFI and Motorcoach Industries, per Hydrogen Central.

Widespread migration to electric vehicles is well underway — with EV makers like Tesla passing major sales milestones, and fuel-cell technology transforming transportation by ground, air, and sea. There is no better time to invest in your future by making your next car an EV.

SACRAMENTO – Regional and federal officials gathered Wednesday to celebrate Sacramento’s successful attainment of the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone by the 2024 deadline, a milestone hailed as a public health and environmental achievement.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Pacific Southwest Region Administrator Josh F.W. Cook joined Sacramento-area leaders to mark the announcement, which was based on certified air quality data from 2022 to 2024. The determination confirms the region has reduced ground-level ozone to meet the 2008 federal standard.

“Congratulations to the Sacramento metropolitan area for successfully meeting the 2008 ozone standard by the 2024 deadline — this is an achievement that will bring numerous health benefits to communities across the region,” Cook said. “I am so pleased to see multiple air districts coming together to accomplish this result. Achieving attainment not only brings cleaner air for residents, but spares businesses from additional regulatory burdens and secures continued eligibility for future federal funding for vital transportation and infrastructure projects.”

The event featured remarks from Congresswoman Doris Matsui, Sac Metro Air District Board Chair and Folsom Mayor Sarah Aquino, Sacramento Metro Chamber representative Cameron Gallad, Placer County Health and Human Services Director Dr. Rob Oldham, and Sac Metro Air District Board Member, Sacramento Mayor Pro Tem and California Air Resources Board Member Eric Guerra. Sac Metro Air District Air Pollution Control Officer Dr. Alberto Ayala emceed the press conference.

Representatives from the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District also attended. Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District Board Chair and Yolo County Supervisor Lucas Frerichs said the milestone reflected years of regional collaboration.

“By working together, we’ve made real progress in reducing air pollution and safeguarding public health for our communities, but our work doesn’t stop here,” Frerichs said. “Our District, along with the other air districts in the Sacramento region, is focused on advancing creative solutions that meet stronger air quality requirements and protect the well-being of our communities long into the future.”

The EPA’s determination means the Sacramento region will now begin developing a maintenance plan and seek formal redesignation to remove its severe nonattainment status. Officials said benefits of attainment include cleaner air for residents, avoided regulatory costs for businesses, reduced damage to crops and vegetation, and continued eligibility for federal transportation and infrastructure funding.

And as of February, there are just under 2,000 public charging stations across North Carolina, not including Tesla chargers, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
The expansion of charging networks in North Carolina comes as President Donald Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will end a $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September.

More than 112,000 EVs were registered in the state as of February, a nearly 40% increase from the same time last year, according to the North Carolina Department of Transportation.

As more drivers make the switch to electric, fast-charging networks are expanding across the state.

Charlotte area-based company, Koulomb, has several fast-charging stations across the Queen City.

It recently opened a charging depot off I-485 in south Charlotte. It’s equipped with 12 fast-chargers and allows drivers to re-charge their electric vehicles in about 15 minutes under a solar canopy.

“We can have 12 cars here at once,” Co-founder Jeff Constantineau said. “We haven’t seen that yet, but I imagine that day will come at some point.”

The site, which looks a bit like a gas station, has been at least two years in the making.

“It took a long time,” Constantineau said. “But there was a lot of work to be done here, and we pride ourselves in quality and we have to do the job right.”

Constantineau says the location helps accelerate the company’s goal to settle EV owners’ worries about driving long distances, otherwise known as “range anxiety.”

“This is a in-a-pinch solution,” Constantineau said. “Eighty percent of charging should be done at the home and in the garage. This 20% solution is really to fill that gap and provide customers more confidence to buy the EV and take the extra step.”

He admits not every driver has access to a charger at home or at work. And as of February, there are just under 2,000 public charging stations across North Carolina, not including Tesla chargers, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“The technology is constantly improving,” Constantineau said. “Right now, we’re just throwing a pretty big band aid on a problem that’s occurring in the Southwest.”

On the other side of the state, Ionna, which is a partnership between eight of the world’s top automakers, has set up similar concepts known as “Rechargeries” in Garner and Apex.

The expansion of charging networks in North Carolina comes as President Donald Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will end a $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September.

Constantineau says he’s uncertain about the impact that will have on his business.

“We got involved in this business because drive EVs, and we just believe it to be the better technology,” Constantineau said. “It’s more fun to drive. They don’t break down, the cost of ownership is super low… we believe in the technology.”

Constantineau says they’re showing no sign of pumping the brakes on expanding their charging network across the state.

“We’re going to build two more [depots],” Constantineau said. “I think we’ll build another two that aren’t depots, that are just kind of four spaces, and then we’ll probably pause for a little while and just watch customer feedback.”

Koulomb currently has nine charging stations across the southeast U.S., including North Carolina, Virginia and Georgia.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/gt_pic-1,N,,2025-08-22 11:03:18.346342

Taken together, they constitute 22.9% of the US’s total available installed utility-scale generating capacity.
At least 25-30% of US solar capacity is in the form of small-scale (e.g., rooftop) systems that are not reflected in FERC’s data.
Including that additional solar capacity would bring the share provided by solar + wind to more than a quarter of the US total.
If small-scale solar capacity is included, renewables are now about one-third of total US generating capacity.","Solar and wind accounted for almost 91% of new US electrical generating capacity added in the first five months of 2025, according to data released on August 20* by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

Solar’s new generating capacity in May 2025 and YTD

In its latest monthly “Energy Infrastructure Update” report (with data through May 31, 2025) reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign, FERC says 43 “units” of solar totaling 1,515 megawatts (MW) were placed into service in May, accounting for 58.7% of all new generating capacity added during the month.

The 11,518 MW of solar added during the first five months of 2025 was 75.3% of the total new capacity placed into service.

Solar has now been the largest source of new generating capacity added each month for 21 consecutive months, starting September 2023.

Solar + wind were nearly 91% of new capacity through May

Between January and May, new wind provided 2,379 MW of capacity additions, accounting for 15.6% of all new capacity added during the first five months of 2025.

For the first five months of 2025, solar and wind comprised 90.9% of new capacity while natural gas (1,381 MW) provided just 9.0%; the remaining 0.1% came from oil (14 MW).

Solar + wind are 22.9% of US utility-scale generating capacity

The installed capacities of solar (11.1%) and wind (11.8%) are now each more than a tenth of the US total. Taken together, they constitute 22.9% of the US’s total available installed utility-scale generating capacity.

At least 25-30% of US solar capacity is in the form of small-scale (e.g., rooftop) systems that are not reflected in FERC’s data. Including that additional solar capacity would bring the share provided by solar + wind to more than a quarter of the US total.

With the inclusion of hydropower (7.7%), biomass (1.1%), and geothermal (0.3%), renewables currently claim a 32.0% share of total US utility-scale generating capacity. If small-scale solar capacity is included, renewables are now about one-third of total US generating capacity.

Solar is on track to become No. 2 source of US generating capacity

FERC reports that net “high probability” additions of solar between June 2025 and May 2028 total 89,513 MW – an amount almost four times the forecast net “high probability” additions for wind (23,019 MW), the second fastest growing resource.

FERC also foresees net growth for hydropower (596 MW) and geothermal (92 MW) but a decrease of 123 MW in biomass capacity.

Taken together, the net new “high probability” capacity additions by all renewable energy sources over the next three years – the bulk of the Trump Administration’s remaining time in office – would total 113,097 MW.

There is no new nuclear capacity in FERC’s three-year forecast, while coal and oil are projected to contract by 24,913 MW and 1,907 MW, respectively. Natural gas capacity would expand by 5,992 MW.

Thus, adjusting for the different capacity factors of gas (59.7%), wind (34.3%), and utility-scale solar (23.4%), electricity generated by the projected new solar capacity to be added in the coming three years should be nearly six times greater than that produced by the new natural gas capacity while the electrical output by new wind capacity would be more than double that by gas.

If FERC’s current “high probability” additions materialize by May 1, 2028, solar will account for 16.7% of US installed utility-scale generating capacity. Wind would provide an additional 12.7% of the total. Thus, each would be greater than coal (12.2%) and substantially more than nuclear power or hydropower (each 7.2%).

In fact, assuming current growth rates continue, the installed capacity of utility-scale solar is likely to surpass that of either coal or wind within two years, putting solar in the No. 2 spot for installed generating capacity, behind natural gas.

Renewables may overtake natural gas within 3 years

All utility-scale (i.e., >1 MW) renewables is now adding about two percentage points each year to its share of generating capacity. At that pace, by June 1, 2028, renewables would account for 37.8% of total available installed utility-scale generating capacity, rapidly approaching that of natural gas (40.2%). Solar and wind would constitute more than three-quarters of the installed capacity of renewable sources. If those trendlines continue, utility-scale renewable energy capacity should surpass that of natural gas in 2029 or sooner.

However, as noted, FERC’s data do not account for the capacity of small-scale solar systems. If that is factored in, within three years, total US solar capacity should exceed 300 GW. In turn, the mix of all renewables would be about 40% of total installed capacity, while natural gas’s share would drop to about 38%.

Moreover, FERC reports that there may actually be as much as 226,821 MW of net new solar additions in the current three-year pipeline in addition to 67,405 MW of new wind, 9,064 MW of new hydropower, 202 MW of new geothermal, and 34 MW of new biomass. By contrast, the net new natural gas capacity in the three-year pipeline potentially totals just 28,797 MW. Consequently, renewables’ share could be even greater by late spring 2028.

Renewables increase and fossil fuels shrink

At the end of 2024, the mix of all renewables accounted for 30.96% of total generating capacity. Solar alone was 10.19% while wind was 11.68%. By the end of May, renewables’ share had risen to 31.98% with solar at 11.13% and wind at 11.80%.

On the other hand, natural gas’s share had slipped from 43.00% to 42.52%, coal fell from 15.30% to 14.89%, and oil dropped from 2.73% to 2.72%. Similarly, nuclear power’s share of generating capacity decreased from 7.84% to 7.74%.

“FERC’s latest data predate enactment of the Trump Administration’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill,’ which may adversely affect the future growth trajectories of wind and solar,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong. “However, FERC’s forecasts suggest that cleaner and lower-cost renewable energy sources will continue to grow, retaining their lead over coal and nuclear power while closing the gap with natural gas.”

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.
“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote.
While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.
Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025.","Solar is set to account for half of new electricity added to the grid in the United States this year, according to predictions from the Energy Information Administration.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.

Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.

In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half.

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.

Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.

Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers.

Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.

On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”

A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation.

Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed.

Trump policy prompts NV Energy to seek escape hatch for would-be clean energy transmitters

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement.

One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.

“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote.

In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA.

While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.

Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.

Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA.

In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled.

If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-robin-1024x6831755863940.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=Sr_DE1RS,N,,2025-08-22 14:05:36.414778

Burgum highlighted the administration's efforts to cut red tape and unleash innovation in American industry, particularly in coal and natural gas exports. He noted the necessity of reliable energy to compete in the AI arms race against China.

Addressing concerns about rising electricity prices linked to Biden-era policies favoring renewable energy, Burgum agreed with Energy Secretary Chris Wright's assessment. ""All of these projects, particularly offshore wind, would not exist without these massive taxpayer subsidies that were passed when Joe Biden was in office,"" Burgum said. He pointed out that some offshore projects rely heavily on tax subsidies rather than electrical generation, leading to higher costs in regions like the northeastern U.S.

Burgum also discussed the administration's efforts to reopen coal mines in Montana, Wyoming, and Utah, which he said had not happened for a decade. ""Extending the leases on federal land... helps us pay down the debt and the deficit,"" he said, stressing the importance of reliable energy for the national grid.

The utility said it also will build new transmission lines to serve the facility and procure as much as 1.5 gigawatts of solar power.

Meta said in a statement it’s working with Entergy to cover the cost of the project without shifting the burden to grid customers. The company added it plans to add enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of the Richland Parish data center, and that it’s launched other clean and renewable energy projects across the state, including one focused on solar.

State officials this week submitted a report to Gov. Gavin Newsom detailing strategies to sustain EV adoption in the absence of federal backing, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.

California Rebates Aim to Replace Federal EV Tax Credits

President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed in July, eliminated federal EV rebates of up to $7,500 effective Sept. 30. Without these incentives, California has already seen a drop in electric vehicle sales. Out of the nearly 900,000 new cars sold in the state by mid-2025, only 22.3% were EVs or plug-in hybrids, compared to more than 25% last year. Tesla, for example, registered just 76,000 cars statewide so far this year — well off its pace of around 200,000 in 2024.

California had previously run its own Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which ended in 2023 after providing $1.49 billion to support over 594,000 EVs, hydrogen cars, and plug-in hybrids. That initiative also averted an estimated 456 million gallons of fuel consumption. According to the new report, restoring state-level rebates is the most effective short-term solution to offset federal rollbacks.

Funding Could Come from California’s Cap-and-Trade Revenues

Daniel Villasenor, a spokesperson for Gov. Newsom, said the state’s $4 billion annual cap-and-trade program is a likely source of new EV subsidies. These funds could support both consumer rebates and infrastructure upgrades. State officials also recommended financial inducements such as discounted toll lane access and continuation of carpool privileges for EV drivers, benefits currently set to expire September 30 without federal authorization.

In addition, the California Public Utilities Commission has been tasked with exploring ways to reduce charging costs, as rising electricity prices have eroded the financial appeal of EV ownership. Report authors stressed the need to expand and maintain the state’s charging network, which continues to struggle with reliability issues like broken charge ports and long wait times.

State Fleets and Advanced Clean Cars III Regulation

The report emphasized that California should lead by example. With a fleet of more than 35,000 vehicles, the state intends to transition its own purchases entirely to zero-emission models.

Meanwhile, legal battles are underway over the federal government’s preemption of California’s Advanced Clean Cars II regulation, which originally banned new gas-only car sales by 2035. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has already filed suit to challenge Trump’s rollback. In parallel, the governor has directed the Air Resources Board to begin drafting an updated Advanced Clean Cars III standard, though details remain forthcoming.

EVXL’s Take

California finds itself in an uphill battle to sustain EV adoption without federal tax credits, a shift that poses both environmental and economic risks. Tesla’s steep sales decline underscores how critical incentives remain, especially as rivals like China and Europe push aggressively forward on zero-emission mandates.

The question for EV advocates is whether Sacramento’s cap-and-trade revenues and state-level policies will be robust enough to keep growth on track. Can California replace federal subsidies at scale, while also fixing its charging infrastructure? And what happens if Advanced Clean Cars III is delayed or watered down by legal challenges?

With federal support receding, California’s moves could determine whether the U.S. EV transition stalls or adapts.

It’s becoming increasingly clear that there’s a third major stagflationary force coming into play: Soaring electricity prices, which will also hurt growth while increasing inflation.

Now, during the 2024 campaign Donald Trump boasted a lot about how he would bring down energy prices. He talked very big, and made specific promises. Notably, he declared that he would cut the price of electricity in half within 12 months of taking office:

So how’s that going?

And this is only the start. Many analysts expect further large increases in electricity prices over the next year or more, largely because of surging demand from AI data centers. The electricity outlook is sufficiently scary that Texas — Texas! — has passed a new law giving the grid operator the right to cut off data centers during periods of power shortage.

An aside: In the America I grew up in, people who made big boasts about what they would achieve then completely failed to deliver were considered unserious blowhards. What happened to that country?

But Trump has a scapegoat, which probably won’t surprise you — renewable energy:

It’s unclear what his theory is. How does adding wind and solar generating capacity — increasing electricity supply — lead to higher prices?

To the extent that there is a story here, it involves what I’ve called MAGA brain, “the belief that the only way you can get results is by being tough and nasty, avoiding anything that might be considered woke” — which includes renewable energy.

As it happens, the data overwhelmingly reject Trump’s claims about renewables and prices. The Department of Energy has data on the share of each state’s electricity generated by renewable sources. For example, Iowa gets 80 percent of its utility-scale power from renewables, mostly wind, while New Jersey only gets 4.6 percent from renewables. Yet Iowa’s electricity prices actually fell slightly from May 2024 to May 2025, while NJ prices rose 10 percent.

Trump, however, has his own reality:

Except New Jersey doesn’t have any windmills. There have been proposals for large offshore wind farms, but they have never come to fruition — and Trump has signed executive orders that will effectively ban future offshore wind development.

So why are electricity prices soaring? The main answer is clearly a surge in power consumption by data centers, driven mainly by AI. Crypto is also playing a role, although we don’t know for sure how much — and thanks to the influence of the crypto bros, we may never find out:

Can we blame Trump for rising electricity prices? Not yet. The AI boom began well before Trump won the election, and the grid just wasn’t ready. Trump is, however, doing all he can to make the problem worse — boosting crypto and AI while blocking the expansion of renewable energy, which has accounted for the bulk of recent growth in electric generating capacity:

Oh, and the Trump administration is rolling back energy efficiency standards for home appliances, which will worsen the electricity shortage.

So the electricity crisis is set to get worse. And it will matter a lot. Households spend a substantial share of their budgets on electricity, but the overall impact of electricity prices goes well beyond your utility bills: electricity is an important cost of doing business, and an increase in that cost will be passed on to consumers. By my estimate, overall spending on electricity — both direct spending by consumers and spending by businesses that ultimately gets passed on to consumers — is about 2 percent of GDP. So large electricity price increases could have a significant effect on the cost of living.

Rising electricity costs will also lead businesses to produce and invest less. In particular, as I wrote the other day, energy shortages could bring the boom in AI spending to a screeching halt — and that spending is currently the only thing keeping the U.S. economy above stall speed, growth so slow that economic weakness becomes self-reinforcing.

Many people, myself included, have drawn parallels between the current AI frenzy and the telecoms boom and bust of the late 1990s — an alarming parallel, because the telecom bust led to years of elevated unemployment. But as Peter Oppenheimer of Goldman Sachs has pointed out, there have been many such boom-bust cycles over the centuries, going back to Britain’s canal mania in the 1790s. And here’s one analogy that has occurred to me: What would have happened if, midway through the 1790s canal-building boom, investors had realized that there wasn’t enough water to fill all those new canals?

So the electricity crisis is serious, adding significantly to the risk of stagflation. Unfortunately, it would be hard to find policymakers I’d trust less to deal with this crisis than the Trump administration, whose energy policy is driven by petty prejudices (Trump is still mad about the windmills he thinks ruin the view from his Scottish golf course), macho posturing (real men burn stuff), and hallucinations (the imaginary windmills of New Jersey.)

A word about Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook

I’ll write more about the Lisa Cook affair next week, but feel that I should say something now. Cook is a Federal Reserve governor, a long-term appointment — long-term because we want to insulate the Fed from political pressure.

Now Trump officials are demanding that Cook resign because, they claim, she once provided false information on mortgage applications, claiming two different houses as her primary residence.

It’s clear that the Trump Administration is weaponizing federal mortgage records to go after anyone they think stands in their way. First Leticia James, next Adam Schiff, and now Lisa Cook. Rather than follow fair legal procedures and allow Cook to defend herself, Trump makes insinuations about Lisa Cook and demands that she quit her position.

Of course, everyone understands what’s happening here – even that socialist rag, the Wall Street Journal. Trump wants to replace Cook with an obedient minion, so Trump loyalists went trawling through everything they could find out about her, looking for some pretext to force her out. This is a grotesque abuse of power.

It also endangers America’s future. The Fed’s perceived independence is a major source of economic stability — more about that in this week’s primer. We’re already worried about stagflation. The risk will be far greater if Trump can dictate monetary policy by bullying individual Fed officials and creating a servile Federal Reserve Board. Just look at what happened in Turkey.

Cook says that she will not give in to pressure. Good for her.

Clean energy jobs may be growing faster than ever, but reskilling is the cornerstone of a sustainable and just transition.","By-Chandra Kishore Thakur

The global race to decarbonise is not only about technology and infrastructure—it is fundamentally a workforce revolution. As clean energy investments surge, the greatest challenge of 2025 is no longer whether renewables will dominate the energy mix, but whether nations can cultivate the skilled human capital to sustain that future.

Global Momentum, Local Gaps

In 2023, the energy sector added 2.5 million jobs, taking total employment to over 67 million. The sector’s growth rate of 3.8% outpaced the global average of 2.2%, buoyed by record investments amid the energy crisis. With green infrastructure spending surpassing $2 trillion in 2024, the International Energy Agency expects renewable energy jobs to expand steadily through 2030.

Yet, a widening skills gap threatens to slow this momentum. Between 2023 and 2024, global demand for green skills rose 11.6%, while supply increased only 5.6%. The World Economic Forum estimates that 40% of the global workforce will need to be reskilled within three years to meet the twin forces of digitalisation and decarbonisation.

Specialised sectors are under particular pressure. The maritime industry alone may need to retrain nearly 450,000 seafarers by 2030 for zero-carbon fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia—a figure that could rise to 800,000 by the mid-2030s. Similar demands exist across power systems, construction, and advanced manufacturing.

India’s Human Capital Challenge

India is at a critical juncture in its green transition. By October 2024, renewables accounted for 203 GW—or 46%—of installed electricity capacity, growing 13.5% year-on-year. The sector’s workforce demand rose 23.7% in FY24, driven by solar, wind, and battery storage deployment.

But the country faces a looming skills shortfall. India will need 1.2 million additional trained workers for solar manufacturing and deployment alone. Without intervention, the shortfall could exceed 26% by 2027. Attrition compounds the challenge. While industry-wide attrition declined modestly to 33.5% in late 2024, many firms continue to grapple with critical talent losses, recruitment costs, and project delays. Workforce stability, therefore, remains as critical as workforce expansion.

Some states have begun responding. Andhra Pradesh, for instance, launched a demand-driven green skilling roadmap in August 2025, engaging over 250 stakeholders across industry and academia. The programme emphasises inclusivity, with targeted training for women, tribal youth, and micro-entrepreneurs in solar and wind. Other states and public sector institutions must adopt similar forward-looking strategies to build a robust talent pipeline.

Creating a Future-Ready Workforce

Closing the skills gap requires systemic change. This means expanding vocational training, certification programmes, and hands-on learning in solar, wind, hydrogen, and smart grid technologies. Public-private partnerships should co-create training pathways and apprenticeships, while employers embrace skill-based hiring and micro-credentials.

Equally, digital fluency must be embedded across the workforce. Predictive maintenance, smart grid analytics, and AI-driven modelling are becoming core skills. Global firms like IBM and PwC are already integrating AI into sustainability training, signalling the strategic role of digital tools in climate action.

Just as important is ensuring a just transition. Workers in fossil fuel industries must be offered reskilling opportunities, social protection, and pathways into green jobs. Inclusive hiring—particularly of women and marginalised communities—can both expand the talent pool and make the transition equitable.

From Infrastructure to Inclusion

The success of global decarbonisation will not be judged by megawatts alone, but by the strength of the workforce behind it. Clean energy jobs may be growing faster than ever, but reskilling is the cornerstone of a sustainable and just transition.

By investing in education, digital readiness, and inclusive employment, countries can ensure the energy transition delivers not just cleaner power but shared prosperity—where technology advances hand in hand with people and purpose.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/08/22/green-jobs-editorial-2025-08-22-15-18-35.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 10:01:56.824138

“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said.
The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of least 25 years.

The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.

“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.

For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility—first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities—was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant—which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates—is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.

Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”

What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility. “Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.

As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of least 25 years.

Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.

Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.

“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.

Shell’s tax “windfall” in Pennsylvania

Shell’s tax breaks from the state are behind its decision to push forward with the project even as other companies walked away from the “renaissance” for economic reasons, said Anne Keller, managing director at Midstream Energy Group, an energy consultancy. Keller has worked in the energy and petrochemical industry for more than 30 years. Compared to Ohio and West Virginia, Pennsylvania “far and away shelled out more money,” she said.

In 2016, then-vice president of Shell’s Appalachia Petrochemicals Division, Ate Visser, acknowledged the role the subsidies played in its decision-making. “I can tell you, hand to my heart, that without the fiscal incentives, we would not have taken this investment decision,” he said.

Those incentives help to explain how Shell ended up stranded in a region that turned out not to make sense for petrochemical buildout in the current market.

Keller said Pennsylvania’s gift to Shell is unprecedented in the industry. “I’ve literally never heard of anything like that. It was just stunning,” she said. “The state got dealt.”

While there was some greater economic advantage to the region during construction, when more than 9,000 workers were needed, once the plant became operational and the workforce shrank to 500, “the state might as well have just put people in an office and written them a check,” Keller said. Essentially, she said, the financial benefit to the company is so large that the state is effectively off-setting the cost of all full-time employees at Monaca with the tax break.

Edwards, the company spokesperson, said Shell currently employs about 500 people in Monaca and “regularly averages” approximately 400 contractors at the site. Four hundred is the minimum number of permanent jobs required by the state’s tax agreement with Shell.

In 2012, the year the state legislature passed the $1.65 billion tax credit, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s industry and labor secretary, Julia Hearthway, said she was convinced that the Shell plant would “kickstart a chemical manufacturing boom.”

“And with it comes jobs. Not a few hun­dred jobs. Not one com­pany hir­ing 300 or 400 jobs. But thou­sands and thou­sands of jobs to Pennsylvania,” she told StateImpact Pennsylvania.

At one point, the Corbett administration claimed the Shell plant would spawn 20,000 permanent jobs directly and indirectly, because it would draw so many people to move to Beaver County. The administration said Shell would build its plant in another state if Pennsylvania didn’t offer enough incentives.

That same year, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center called the tax breaks “a windfall” for Shell and said the deal was expensive for taxpayers while creating few permanent jobs. That warning now appears prescient.

The economic boom and thousands of new jobs that were supposed to follow in Shell’s wake have failed to materialize, according to research conducted by the Ohio River Valley Institute.

“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened,” said Eric de Place, an energy policy consultant who has researched Shell Monaca for ORVI. De Place’s analysis found that Beaver County’s population has declined since 2012, and it has not seen growth in jobs, GDP or businesses.

“There’s simply no way to look at economic performance and say, ‘Beaver County got this petrochemical plant and it flourished.’ In fact, it is declining relative to the U.S. and Pennsylvania, and it has not outperformed the counties around it,” he said. “I think you look at the scoreboard and you say, this was a terrible investment of taxpayer money.”

Stier said of Shell’s change of course, “The real driver of this is corporate strategy. Fifteen years ago, Shell was going in a different direction.

“It just goes to show you how big global companies can change their strategies pretty quickly. Companies can make some big, multibillion-dollar mistakes at times, and market conditions change,” Stier said. For Shell, “this asset no longer fits.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Inside-Climate-News-Cracker-plant-2048x1366.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 11:02:20.288519

Titled ‘Small and Electric – The International Case to Move Away from Combustion SUVs’, the report argues that smaller EVs could serve as a practical response to current industry challenges while also ensuring the long-term competitiveness of traditional automakers.

Authored by GFEI partner organisation UC Davis, the GFEI Working Paper 25 examines the global car market trends since 2005 and identifies a shift towards larger, heavier vehicles, primarily due to higher profits for manufacturers.

However, this trend has also led to an increase in vehicle prices and a slowdown in the turnover of vehicle stocks, which in turn hampers the transition to EVs, the report said.

The report pointed out that larger vehicles not only require more materials, including scarce minerals, but also consume more energy in both production and operation.

By focusing on larger EV models, the industry risks diminishing the environmental benefits of electric cars, making them less affordable for consumers and slowing down market penetration.

China’s success in manufacturing smaller EVs is noted as a competitive advantage.

The country, responsible for 27% of global passenger car sales, has made significant strides in battery supply chains, manufacturing efficiency, and software for EV production.

This has put pressure on legacy automakers, who have been slower to move away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

The GFEI report also argues that legacy manufacturers must embrace the production of smaller EVs on a large scale to remain competitive.

To support this transition, the report offers a range of public policy recommendations. These include the introduction of targeted incentives, tax measures, and regulatory support to steer the car market towards smaller vehicles.

It also suggests considering temporary tariffs based on domestic content or price undertakings to bolster supply chain diversification in vulnerable regions.

Additionally, the report calls for the promotion of investments in charging infrastructure that is cost-effective, accessible, and affordable. This would make EVs with smaller batteries more attractive to consumers.

Moreover, scaling up research and innovation is crucial to closing global competitiveness gaps, focusing on technologies that enhance battery manufacturing productivity and the development of advanced, material-efficient battery designs.

FIA Foundation deputy director Sheila Watson said: “Size matters in the race to electrification. ICE vehicles are already too big and too expensive. This trend must be reversed as we move to an electric fleet and work towards a resilient and sustainable mobility future.”",https://www.motorfinanceonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/08/gfei-shutterstock_2096925775.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:06:13.084213

Slide by slide, about 30 company logos flashed on the screens during an educational session at this year’s Southeastern & International Propane Expo in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The logos represented the many manufacturers and providers of propane-fueled power generation equipment across multiple segments – prime and standby, towable and portable, as well as combined heat and power (CHP).

The session, led by Bert Warner of the Propane Education & Research Council (PERC), highlighted a market that propane industry leaders say is ripe with opportunity for propane marketers seeking to grow gallons and diversify their offerings. This year’s Propane Expo also hosted another power generation session, led by Steve Stump of Dragon Power, on microgrids.

“The nice thing is, we’re not starting from scratch,” says Warner, the director of commercial business development at PERC, during a July call with LP Gas.

The big reveal

During his discussions with the propane industry, Warner says, he simply tries to “pull the curtain back” and reveal the “blue chip companies” already operating in the propane power generation space.

“Whether it’s talking to an engineer or a contractor or even a propane marketer, this equipment is available in these [multiple] sizes today,” he says. “Creating that education and building that awareness around the power generation space is critical.”

Some of the power generation companies have exhibited at propane industry trade shows – Dragon Power, Eco Power Equipment, Enginuity Power Systems, Evergreen Mobile Power and Polar Power, for example, and some have entered propane industry partnerships.

Earlier this year, Blue Star Power Generation, a subsidiary of Blue Star Gas, signed a distributor agreement with EC Power Inc. The partnership enables Blue Star to incorporate EC Power’s XRGI25 – a 24-kilowatt CHP system – into its product offerings for customers. The XRGI25 system provides both heat and on-site power from a single unit.

Last year, PERC completed a three-year partnership with Qnergy, resulting in the development of a standalone, hybrid nanogrid power generation package based on Qnergy’s PowerGen platform. The hybrid technology, ideal for electric vehicle charging, creates an opportunity for a network of distributed, autonomous charging stations powered by propane or other portable fuel.

“We’re really focused on power generation across all the markets – from 1.25 kilowatts in a fuel cell to 30 megawatts in a data center,” says Tucker Perkins, president and CEO of PERC. “We’re aware of all those opportunities. We certainly tend to skew back toward the residential, commercial level that all propane marketers could [participate] in.”

Power generation team

Warner joined PERC power generation team leaders Gavin Hale and Jim Bunsey on the July call with LP Gas, proving in part how power generation applications have expanded into different propane market segments.

While Warner is focused on the commercial market, Bunsey places his attention on material handling and market strategy for ports, which continue with initiatives to cut their carbon output.

“Ports are looked at as a dirty place with high populations around them,” Bunsey says. “They use a lot of diesel.”

Companies such as Pioneer eMobility and EnviroCharge, for example, are providing propane-powered charging infrastructure for port applications, and refrigerated containers need a clean power source as well, he adds.

“Where I know equipment has been deployed, it’s been in the ports,” Bunsey says. “It affects every one of us on a daily basis.”

To maintain momentum in the ports, propane industry leaders are touting new port infrastructure funding opportunities totaling $500 million. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration is accepting applications through Sept. 10 to support port infrastructure development and improvements through the 2025 Port Infrastructure Development Program.

The National Propane Gas Association says the program provides opportunities for applicants to incorporate propane into their projects. That includes the development of port or terminal microgrids, including backup generators and power sources, and their fueling.

“We’ve been in the game, but it’s nice to be listed now as a fuel that can help the ports or distribution centers,” Bunsey says.

Thinking big

Hale, the director of product development and power generation at PERC, is thinking big when he says of the propane industry, “We got locked into this ‘small KW’ world.” He believes the technology available today and the current industry partnerships with OEMs position propane well for a future in large-scale applications.

“We have traction with more engine OEMs around propane than I can remember,” he says. “We’ve got major OEMs that have a policy now that are all in the U.S. market.”

Hale says more OEMs based overseas are being driven to the U.S. market because they see a pathway to meeting the country’s energy demand needs and cost challenges. He references Jenbacher and Guascor Energy specifically.

Jenbacher, with main headquarters in Austria and North American headquarters in Houston, specializes in on-site power generation through gas-fueled technologies. Its engines have been installed in projects ranging from several hundred kilowatts to 51 megawatts, according to its website.

“They’ve gone from being a marketing organization to a team of 30 salespeople, application engineers and a plan now to build products here in the U.S.,” Hale says.

Guascor, based in Spain, is a manufacturer of gas and diesel engines designed for power generation and other markets. Its gas engines, which Hale describes as “massively efficient in running propane,” can power electricity production plants.

Hale views engaging with OEMs, including those overseas, as a key piece to developing the power generation market because the timing is right, the products are available, and the companies can help in both building the equipment and spreading the message about propane.

“From a technical standpoint, we now have more products to work with than we’ve had for a long time,” he says. “Our playbook has grown massive.”

Messages for marketers

During the Propane Expo session, Warner shared PERC’s goal of displacing diesel in the power generation sector by 12 percent, equating to 45 million gallons, by 2029. He knows it will take more propane marketer buy-in to reach that goal, however. That’s why he wants marketers to keep an open mind when it comes to power generation.

“It’s an area for growth if they want to go after it,” he says.

At first, it may seem out of their comfort zone, he admits, but they don’t have to be experts. They just have to know where to turn – including to industry resources like PERC and partnerships with OEMs or rental companies – when the opportunity presents itself and show confidence in the solution they provide.

“The OEMs are thirsty for it,” Warner says of propane as a clean, reliable solution for growth. “They don’t have the boots on the ground that marketers possess.”

Propane marketers have a tremendous advantage, adds Scott Mook of Evergreen Mobile Power, maker of the JuiceBox generator, in which they can “double dip.”

“Propane marketers already have the customer base for this machine,” he says. “They know the construction [companies], homebuilders, those with tents and the events industry, racing or barbecue cookoffs, but they’ve never thought about providing power. They just want to provide gas. This takes them someplace they haven’t been before.”

Elon Musk has big dreams for the Tesla Roadster

The latest Tesla technology patent was filed on August 5, 2025.

The system works by generating low-pressure zones beneath the vehicle, essentially sucking it closer to the road during extreme acceleration or tight cornering.

That extra grip is exactly what you’d need if you were aiming for Elon Musk’s audacious goal: a sub-one-second 0–60 mph time.

For context, the current king of Tesla performance, the Model S Plaid, hits 60mph in just under 2 seconds, which is already face-warping.

But Musk insists the Tesla Roadster will be faster still, once again pushing the boundaries of what a street-legal car can do.

Of course, blistering acceleration is only part of the story.

This aero wizardry could also improve efficiency during normal driving by reducing drag in highway cruising conditions.

More efficiency means longer range, fewer charging stops, and lower costs for drivers, which are benefits that matter just as much as bragging rights at the traffic lights.

It’s a neat reminder that race-car tech can have practical payoffs in everyday EVs.

This Tesla technology patent is a much-needed boost

The timing of the latest Tesla technology patent couldn’t be more crucial for the struggling carmaker.

The company’s revenue fell 12 percent in the second quarter of 2025, its steepest decline in more than a decade, with deliveries down 13 percent year-over-year.

Just last month, Elon Musk lost $12 billion in wealth overnight, when Tesla’s share-price declined sharply.

Rivals like BYD, Nio, and Porsche are churning out sleek, fast EVs of their own, and the once-untouchable Tesla brand is under pressure to prove it can still innovate.

In fact, BYD’s quad-motor EV with almost 3,000 horsepower is getting a lot of attention, as it seeks to dethrone the Rimac Nevera R as the world’s most powerful road-legal production car.

A Tesla Roadster that feels more spaceship than sports car might be exactly what the company needs to get out of its current slump.

This aligns with recent federal and state efforts to boost clean energy supply chains. For Meta, the choice supports both energy sustainability and the American manufacturing sector.

Doubling Down on Net Zero: Meta’s Clean Power Play

Meta has been one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable power in the U.S. and globally. Since 2020, the company has achieved net-zero emissions for its global operations. It did this mainly by offsetting emissions with clean power purchases.

The company aims for net zero across its entire value chain by 2030. This includes emissions from suppliers, construction, and product life cycles. To reach this, Meta continues to:

Develop or contract new solar and wind projects close to its data centers.

Invest in renewable capacity that exceeds its immediate energy needs to ensure a stable, clean energy supply.

Partner with local utilities and developers to add new capacity to regional grids.

By early 2025, Meta has contracts for over 10 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy globally. This positions it as one of the leading corporate buyers of renewable energy. The map shows the company’s renewable energy projects.

The new South Carolina deal builds on this success. It also expands renewable energy in the southeastern U.S. Demand for hyperscale data centers is growing quickly in this region.

Why Solar for Data Centers?

Data centers consume massive amounts of electricity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that global data center energy consumption was about 360 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023. This accounts for nearly 2% of the world’s electricity demand.

With the rapid adoption of AI, machine learning, and cloud services, that figure could double by 2030.

Solar energy offers an attractive solution for companies like Meta:

Scalability: Utility-scale solar projects can be built quickly to meet rising demand.

Cost-Effectiveness: Solar has become one of the cheapest sources of new electricity worldwide.

Low Emissions: Solar farms provide near-zero operational emissions, helping firms reduce Scope 2 emissions.

South Carolina provides an especially strong solar opportunity. The state ranks among the top 10 U.S. states for solar power growth, with more than 6,000 MW of installed capacity as of 2024. Favorable policies and abundant sunshine make it a natural location for Meta’s expansion.

AI’s Energy Appetite: The Race for Clean Power

The timing of this deal also reflects the industry’s race to manage AI-driven energy demand. McKinsey & Company estimates that artificial intelligence will need 124 GW of new data center capacity worldwide from 2025 to 2030. This will require trillions in investment and a sharp increase in renewable energy procurement.

Meta’s peers are already making similar moves:

Microsoft plans to use 100% renewable electricity by 2025. They have also signed several power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the U.S. and Europe.

Google is working toward a 24/7 carbon-free energy model, aiming to match its power use with renewable generation every hour of the day by 2030.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has signed contracts for over 500 renewable energy projects globally. This makes AWS the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy.

Meta’s South Carolina project signals its intent to stay competitive in both sustainability leadership and AI readiness.

Made in America: Solar Supply Chains Shine

Another important aspect of the Silicon Ranch deal is its reliance on U.S.-made solar components. This reflects a growing effort to localize supply chains for renewable energy equipment.

Federal incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have led to billions in solar manufacturing in the U.S. The total planned solar module manufacturing capacity in the U.S. could exceed 50 GW by 2025. This will cover a large part of the new projects.

For Meta, sourcing from U.S. suppliers helps reduce shipping emissions, supports domestic jobs, and ensures compliance with clean energy policies that favor domestic content. It also offers protection against supply chain issues that have impacted global solar markets lately.

The Corporate Solar Rush: Who’s Leading the Pack?

Meta’s announcement fits into a broader surge in corporate renewable energy procurement. BloombergNEF reports that companies signed 36 GW of new clean energy contracts in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for nearly half of the total.

Key trends driving growth include:

Policy Support: Incentives such as the IRA in the U.S. and similar measures abroad.

Investor Pressure: Shareholders increasingly demand climate action and net-zero plans.

Customer Expectations: Businesses and consumers prefer brands aligned with sustainability.

The rise of hyperscale data centers, especially those powering AI, is expected to accelerate demand. Analysts forecast that corporate PPAs could exceed 50 GW annually by 2030, creating a major pipeline for renewable developers.

Future-Proofing AI: Meta’s Next Green Moves

The 100 MW solar deal in South Carolina boosts Meta’s renewable energy goals. It also adds credibility as the company expands its AI-powered infrastructure.

Moreover, it shows that renewable procurement is now essential for technology companies working at hyperscale, not just optional.

Looking forward, Meta is expected to expand renewable sourcing in other states and potentially explore 24/7 carbon-free energy solutions, following Google’s lead. Water conservation will likely become important, too. Public interest in the environmental impact of data centers is growing.

For the renewable energy sector, corporate demand from companies like Meta will remain a key driver. Solar developers, utilities, and manufacturers stand to benefit from the race to power the digital economy sustainably.

As data centers expand, agreements like this will be key in shaping the tech industry and the clean energy shift.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2303237419.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 10:02:08.157039

Experts and members of the public on Tuesday voiced overwhelming opposition to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to rescind its key greenhouse gas “endangerment finding” and vehicle emissions standards.

That pushback came during the first of four scheduled public hearings on the agency’s plan to overturn its prior finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The finding, in turn, allowed prior administrations to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations for more than a decade.

The original finding followed a 2007 Supreme Court case, Massachusetts v. EPA, in which the court determined that greenhouse gas emissions qualify as air pollutants—and ordered the EPA to assess whether the emissions endangered public health.

In 2009, the EPA turned its determination into one of the most consequential actions the agency had taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat the growing climate crisis.

But in its new proposal, the agency has threatened to undo the very same environmental protections it once enabled.

At the start of Tuesday’s hearing, Aaron Szabo, assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA, said that the agency is “committed to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, restore the rule of law and give power back to states to make their own decisions.”

The EPA declined an interview request for this story. But in a July press release, the agency criticized the Obama administration for “mental leaps” that led it to determine that greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles contribute “some unspecified amount to climate change, which in turn creates some unspecified amount of endangerment to human health and welfare.”

According to the press release, the EPA’s new proposal to rescind that finding cites “new scientific and technological developments” that challenge the assumptions behind the endangerment finding. The EPA has justified the move by citing a Department of Energy report that top climate scientists have decried as “antiscientific.”

The report contains a variety of claims that contradict the scientific consensus on climate change. It instead says that the crisis “appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed,” and it suggests that increased carbon dioxide levels could be a positive development by increasing crop yields and argues that climate model projections overestimate warming.

But the vast majority of speakers during the opening day of the EPA’s public hearings hit back at those claims and urged the agency not to overturn the 2009 finding. From attorneys general to clergy members, from physicians to federal and state lawmakers, the message to the EPA was resounding.

Out of roughly 200 people who testified on Tuesday, Inside Climate News counted fewer than 10 who spoke in favor of the EPA’s move.

The rest expressed significant concerns over the agency’s rationale for the repeal and highlighted the potential consequences for public health, the environment and the United States’ moral stature on the world stage.

Representatives from organizations including the American College of Physicians, the National Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association warned the agency that rescinding the finding would have a disastrous impact on the health of all Americans—especially those with medical conditions and from disadvantaged communities.

“In the case of climate change, things cannot be clearer: Greenhouse gases are driving climate change, which is harming people’s lungs across the country,” said Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association.

“Standards that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles have been used by EPA for decades under multiple administrators,” Wimmer said. “Repealing them would not only threaten an acceleration of climate change, it would also lead to increases in harmful air pollution that impact lung health.”

Dr. Ankush Bansal, president-elect of Physicians for Social Responsibility—a Nobel Peace Prize-winning nonprofit—drew a direct line between emissions from nonelectric motor vehicles and harms to human health.

And Khadijah Ameen, co-founder and director of policy and research at the Georgia nonprofit BLKHLTH, said that the ramifications of greenhouse gas emissions are “concentrated in communities that have already been historically excluded and under-resourced.”

Attorneys general and assistant attorneys general from eight states also decried the move as illegal and misguided.

The EPA’s proposal relies on an “unvetted, scientifically unsound report from the Department of Energy to attempt to override the abundant and growing science supporting its endangerment finding and motor vehicle [greenhouse gas] emissions standards,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.

Representatives from organizations including the American Petroleum Institute, National Automobile Dealers Association, American Trucking Associations, and the CO2 Coalition—a nonprofit advocacy organization that has been criticized for its climate change denialism—spoke in support of the EPA’s proposal.

“CO2 should be celebrated, not demonized,” said Gregory Wrightstone, CO2 Coalition’s executive director. “We don’t have too much CO2—we don’t have enough.”

Will Hupman, representing the American Petroleum Institute, thanked the EPA for its move to “unleash American energy,” adding that it will roll back “heavy-handed and one-size-fits-all vehicle mandates set by the previous administration.”

“We understand the importance of reducing emissions from the transportation sector, but believe the Biden administration took the wrong approach,” Hupman said. “Its approach favored a single technology over all others, and would have effectively mandated the sale of electric vehicles.

“This proposed rule takes a critical step towards restoring consumer choice and protecting the freedom of Americans to decide what to buy and drive to fit their personal needs.”

Public hearings are expected to continue through Friday, and experts anticipate that the change will be challenged in court if the agency moves forward with its plan to rescind the finding.

Despite the balance of testimony leaning heavily against the EPA’s proposal, it appears unlikely that the Trump administration will reverse course on a key component of its drive to deregulate and roll back environmental protections.

“The reconsideration of the 2009 endangerment finding [of] greenhouse gas emissions is completely flawed,” said Jason Touw, who identified himself as a farmer and a registered Republican.

“I want to say that while the public comment period is necessary under law, personally, I believe that the decision at EPA has already been made,” Touw said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25058770012819.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-22 12:07:39.152473

Word in Black

Among the many, many provisions in the White House-sponsored budget bill that was signed into law on the Fourth of July are a host of environmental measures that continue the Trump administration’s work to undo any and all progress on climate change.

“It is not an overstatement to say this is the most anti-environment bill in history,” Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, said in a statement.

And as the Biden administration was very focused on environmental and climate justice in particular, the new bill targets many of those programs, too, and rescinds the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program entirely.

Environmental activist Mustafa Ali put it plainly: “The bill greenlights pollution — literally. It weakens the Clean Air Act, disables the EPA’s ability to regulate toxic emissions, and rolls back protections for drinking water. It tells corporations they can dump, poison, and profit without consequence. And who suffers? The same people who always suffer.” Black, Brown, Indigenous, and low-income Americans.

Billions in promised grants now in jeopardy

Established through the Inflation Reduction Act, the program earmarked $2.8 billion in grants, and $200 million in technical assistance to invest in underserved communities —“80 times more than any federal investment in environmental justice in history,” Chandra Taylor-Sawyer, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, told Rolling Stone last year.

While many grants have already been paid out (which hasn’t stopped the EPA from attempting to take that money back), a significant amount of funding through the program remains unawarded. In February, a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that over $1 billion in IRA environmental justice funding has not yet been obligated. The funding was supposed to remain available through Sep. 30, 2026.

Lawsuits push back against EPA’s rollbacks

Green and Healthy Homes Initiative, which was named by the Biden administration as a regional grantmakers for the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, one of a number of ways that the EPA’s IRA funds were being distributed, was one of three plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the EPA filed earlier this year after the agency tried to unilaterally cancel its block grant. The nonprofits won that suit last month.

“In the bill that went through the House and Senate, the Senate amended to not repeal obligated funds, but only rescind non-obligated funds,” explains Ruth Ann Norton, president of Green & Healthy Homes Initiative (GHHI). “Our funds are obligated, as our fourth-circuit ruling deemed. The cancellation of those grants was unlawful, in the words of the judge.”

Fighting for communities

The Maryland-based GHHI is in the process of distributing its block grant to community-based organizations throughout the mid-Atlantic, the region the Biden EPA put it in charge of.

“We do have about 111 identified subrecipients, 72 of which are fully contracted and have already started to draw on payments,” Norton says. “The whole reason that we work through this dispute is simply to ensure that communities have funds to address issues of environmental quality and to advance public health.”

In another class-action lawsuit that was just filed in June, a similar argument is being made that the EPA can’t reclaim money that was congressionally allocated. That suit seeks to have some 350 previously awarded grants, totaling $3 billion, reinstated.

The end of a short-lived climate justice era?

While there’s a good chance that the legal argument will win there too, and the awarded grants will remain rewarded, the funding that was still available is now likely dead and gone – and the all-too-short era of when the federal government made an effort to address climate justice, funneled billions of dollars into doing so, now seems even more squarely behind us.

‘“We can’t lose our focus on mission,” Norton said, “but I don’t have an answer entirely where\ we’re gonna go for all of the money, cause even philanthropy doesn’t have enough money to backfill in many communities what government was otherwise funding.”",https://i0.wp.com/afro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25122653130369.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-22 11:02:23.962898

These developments aim to enhance the state’s electric grid, benefiting all customers while accommodating future energy demands.

The approval enables Entergy Louisiana to construct three new combined cycle combustion turbine generation facilities. Two will be situated in Richland Parish, expected to become operational by late 2028, while the third facility will be developed at Entergy’s Waterford location in St. Charles Parish by the end of 2029.

Additionally, new transmission facilities will be built to serve Meta’s data centre and improve system reliability across Entergy’s service area.

The LPSC has also sanctioned Entergy Louisiana to acquire up to 1.5GW of solar resources through an expedited certification process. This move supports large-scale customers in achieving renewable energy targets and aligns with the state’s economic development objectives.

Entergy Louisiana president and CEO Phillip May said: “These investments will help power one of the most advanced data centres in the world and will also reinforce our grid, create economic opportunity and support a more sustainable energy future across Louisiana.

“Importantly, Meta is paying its share of the costs for the infrastructure needed to support its operations, ensuring that other customers are protected from those expenses.”

To facilitate the Richland Parish data centre and broader economic growth, Entergy Louisiana will undertake several projects.

These include the construction of three combined-cycle combustion turbines with a total capacity of 2.26GW, building two company-owned substations and six customer-owned substations, and installing nearly 161km of 500kV transmission lines along with eight new 230kV transmission lines.

Existing infrastructure will also be upgraded, including a substation near Sterlington.

The new generators are designed for initial operations with 30% hydrogen co-firing capacity, with future upgrades allowing for 100% hydrogen use and incorporation of carbon capture and sequestration technology.

Meta has pledged support for carbon capture and storage technology at an Entergy power plant in Lake Charles and plans for 1.5GW of additional solar and storage resources.

Entergy Louisiana commenced construction on a pivotal substation for the Richland Parish data centre, which is touted as one of Louisiana’s largest economic development projects since its announcement in 2024.

nonprofit environmental media organization.

State regulators on Wednesday authorized a controversial plan to power a massive Meta-owned data facility in northeast Louisiana — a project poised to become one of the largest artificial intelligence centers in the world.

The decision by the Louisiana Public Service Commission paves the way for Entergy to build three gas-fired power plants, transmission lines and other infrastructure serving the $10 billion center, which Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, plans to develop on farmland east of Monroe in rural Richland Parish.

While concerns have been raised about the potential for higher power bills and impacts to air and water, most commissioners said the center will be an economic boon for an area with few jobs and a declining population.

“I’m for it 1,000%,” said Foster Campbell, a Democrat who represents north Louisiana on the commission. “Let’s give the people of northeast Louisiana some hope.”

The commission voted 4-1 in favor of the energy plan at their meeting in Plaquemine, which drew about 150 attendees in the audience. The commission had been expected to consider the plan in October but was urged by Entergy to expedite the process.

Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat whose district includes much of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, voted against the plan. Lewis has repeatedly raised concerns about the project since it was announced last year, but his stance has softened in recent weeks.

“The current plan is a significant improvement from what was originally proposed,” he said, highlighting consumer protections that put the burden of rising energy costs back on Meta.

“If there are overruns, Meta will eat the costs,” he said.

Still, he and some other Louisiana residents who spoke at the meeting worry about the project’s reliance on gas power plants, which contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, and the volatility of the gas market. Louisiana lacks large-scale renewable energy sources that could be tapped to offset rising gas prices, Lewis said.

“In Texas, if gas goes up, they can use solar and wind,” he said. “In Louisiana, we have no [energy] load flexibility.”

Some residents said Entergy has a poor record of reliability and often pushes infrastructure costs on ratepayers.

“Entergy can’t keep the lights on on a good day,” Thibodaux resident Logan Wolf said. “I don’t believe they’ll be able to power this grid. I don’t believe them when they say ratepayers won’t pay more.”

The large amounts of water that data centers need to cool computers sometimes tax local water supplies, but Meta has indicated the proposed center will use less water than the farm it will replace.

The plan calls for the construction of three gas plants with a combined capacity of nearly 2,300 megawatts. Two plants would be built in Richland Parish, and a third would likely be located somewhere in south Louisiana. Other infrastructure would include eight substations and about 100 miles of high-capacity transmission lines.

At about 4 million square feet, the facility will be nearly the size of Vatican City and could rank as one of the world’s five biggest data centers by the time it’s completed after 2030.

The project is expected to generate about 500 new jobs, more than 1,000 indirect jobs and employ around 5,000 construction workers, according to Louisiana Economic Development.

The mere prospect of such a project has already sparked economic activity in north Louisiana, said Rob Cleveland, CEO of Grow Northeast Louisiana, an economic development group.

In recent months, several stores and restaurants “have experienced exponential growth,” and three large business projects have been proposed in the 10-parish region.

“All these projects are due to the attention brought by the Meta project,” Cleveland said.

Richland Parish has lost about 2,000 people since the 1980s and now has just under 20,000 residents. About a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, according to Census data.

“This is something drastically needed in north Louisiana,” Campbell said. “It’s a shot in the arm.”",https://press-herald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AI-COMPUTER-random-thinking-fX4lA-CIAwk-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:00:56.405212

Richardson manufactures green energy products, power and grid and microwave tubes and more.

With the support of the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) programme, the company will make a capital investment of more than US$8.5 million over the next four years.

Richardson Electronics will invest in equipment and structural upgrades in order to research, develop, and produce BESS at the company’s manufacturing facility.

Notably, Richardson says its technology will demonstrate the viability of long-duration energy storage (LDES), and is being developed for manufacturing, healthcare and critical infrastructure operations.

The company also says it will retain approximately 200 employees and create 54 full-time jobs.

Richardson Electronics received a REV Illinois tax credit as part of the State’s incentive package, recognising the company’s capital investment and commitment to job creation. The agreement also outlines the retention of 190 jobs throughout the entire agreement period.

In 2023, Pritzker welcomed Gotion High-Tech, a China-headquartered manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries, to the state. The company is establishing a split production facility in Illinois.

In March of this year, Illinois State Senator Bill Cunningham and Representative Marcus Evans introduced a bill, HB3758, to reduce energy bills and set a 15GW energy storage deployment target.

HB3758 shares many similarities with Senate Bill 3997 (SB3997), introduced by Cunningham in January, which aimed to accelerate energy storage in Illinois.

Both bills seem to be at a standstill. SB3997 was adjourned without a set meeting date in January, and HB3758 was re-referred to the rules committee in March.

Fluence expands US supply chain in Houston, Texas

BESS integrator Fluence, in partnership with climate control specialist Bergstrom, has started production of thermal management systems, including HVAC and chiller equipment, at a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas.

The HVAC and chiller equipment will be used for Fluence’s Gridstack Pro BESS solution.

Fluence says the Houston facility “plays a crucial role in the company’s strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-BESS to the United States.”

While increasing US manufacturing of BESS materials has been an ongoing goal for some time, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) and Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements have made it an ever-present issue for companies like Fluence.

As per the company’s statement, it utilises five manufacturing facilities in partnership with US-based manufacturers to produce a range of products, including battery cells, modules, inverters, enclosures, and control equipment. These collaborations account for over 1,200 manufacturing jobs in 2025.

As reported yesterday (21 August), by Energy-Storage.news, Fluence, along with ACE Engineering, just opened a new automated battery storage manufacturing facility in Vietnam’s Bac Giang Province.

Fluence’s new facility has an annual manufacturing capacity of 35GWh, producing Gridstack Pro and Smartstack energy storage systems using fully automated production processes.

This follows other companies, such as Chinese battery and BESS manufacturer, CATL, moving manufacturing capacity to Southeast Asia. CATL broke ground on its battery manufacturing facility in West Java, Indonesia, in July.

Fluence also recently shared its financial results for Q3 2025, reporting a quarterly revenue of US$602.5 million, up 24.7% year-on-year from US$483 million.

According to the company’s latest results, delays in ramping up domestic manufacturing capabilities will push back the generation of approximately US$100 million in revenue until early next year.

The company stated it experienced “some typical ramp-up issues” putting in place its Arizona production lines.

Speaking on the Houston facility, Peter Williams, Fluence’s Chief Product and Supply Chain Officer, said, “This expansion helps accelerate our progress toward increasing US-based production and strengthening a resilient supply chain, and we believe it positions us to maximise domestic content in the solutions we deliver.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-08-at-10.35.52.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 10:02:31.082172

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025.","Solar is set to account for half of new electricity added to the grid in the United States this year, according to predictions from the Energy Information Administration.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.

Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.

In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half.

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.

Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.

Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers.

Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.

On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”

A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation.

Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed.

Trump policy prompts NV Energy to seek escape hatch for would-be clean energy transmitters

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement.

One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.

“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote.

In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA.

While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.

Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.

Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA.

In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled.

If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Solar-Robin.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:08:04.157393

Meta’s latest and largest data center is a 4 million–square–foot complex in rural Louisiana intended to support the company’s most powerful artificial intelligence models. Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has said the facility, dubbed Hyperion, will near the size of Manhattan. At full capacity it is expected to consume as much as 5 gigawatts of electricity.

The center is part of the AI boom that is spurring the biggest surge in US power demand in decades, leading to soaring utility bills and prompting calls for more infrastructure. Entergy Louisiana Chief Executive Phillip May said in a statement Meta will pay its share of costs for the project, expected to generate about 2.3 gigawatts of power. The utility said it also will build new transmission lines to serve the facility and procure as much as 1.5 gigawatts of solar power.

Meta said in a statement it’s working with Entergy to cover the cost of the project without shifting the burden to grid customers. The company added it plans to add enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of the Richland Parish data center, and that it’s launched other clean and renewable energy projects across the state, including one focused on solar.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission fast-tracked the approval after Entergy argued delays would risk Meta building its data center in a different state, according to a Citigroup report led by analyst Ryan Levine.

No major local manufacturing; IRENA urges industrial development.

Africa is increasingly turning to renewable energy to meet its power needs. In 2024, the continent surpassed 70 GW of installed capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). However, this growth relies on imported equipment. The continent is entirely dependent on foreign suppliers for its solar panels, batteries, wind turbines, and other critical components.

In an effort to trace the origins of these technologies, Ecofin Agency has focused its reporting on the key suppliers to the African market. The report breaks down the supply chains for four critical technologies: solar photovoltaics, wind power, battery storage, and inverters. According to a 2024 report by GreenCape, a South African non-profit organization that acts as a catalyst for green economy development in Africa, these categories of components are by far the most imported for major renewable energy projects, whether they are grid-connected or designed for standalone systems.

China Dominates the Photovoltaic Solar Market

Solar is now the leading source of renewable energy deployed in Africa, but this growth is based on a completely imported technology. In 2023, between 85% and 90% of the photovoltaic modules installed in Africa came from China, according to IRENA's ""Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024"" report.

Manufacturers such as LONGi, JA Solar, Trina Solar and Jinko Solar dominate the market, driven by massive industrial capacity and highly competitive prices. While headquartered in Canada, Canadian Solar largely produces in China and is regularly among the top five global exporters.

Most of the modules delivered to the continent are N-type TOPCon, a technology with higher performance in hot conditions, which is widely produced by these five Chinese manufacturers. Africa manufactures neither wafers, nor cells, nor complete modules. Only a few assembly units exist, notably in South Africa.

India, however, is gaining ground in countries like Kenya and Uganda by supplying solar equipment for domestic or rural use. The European Union's commercial presence has shrunk significantly, falling to less than 5% globally, according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2023 ""Solar PV Global Supply Chains"" report. This trend is also reflected in the African market, where its distribution is now marginal.

European Dominance and Chinese Breakthrough in the Wind Market

Unlike the photovoltaic solar market, Africa's wind power market is dominated by European manufacturers. In 2024, according to Wood Mackenzie and the Global Wind Energy Council, European manufacturers remained in the majority in wind installations outside of China. Companies like Vestas have installed over 10 GW in international markets, followed by Siemens Gamesa and Nordex.

In Africa, where detailed data is less available, these three players are nonetheless positioned as the dominant suppliers for major wind farms in North Africa (Morocco, Egypt) and South Africa, according to several recent project reports published between 2022 and 2024.

However, China is gaining ground. According to IRENA, manufacturers like Goldwind and Mingyang have delivered several recent projects to Kenya and Egypt, supported by Chinese financing. Apart from a few mast or foundation assembly operations in South Africa, the major components, including blades, nacelles, generators and converters, remain entirely imported.

Energy Storage: A Market Controlled by China and Korea

In 2024, Asian companies supplied over 95% of the storage systems deployed on the continent. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) dominates the market with an estimated 45% share, followed by LG Energy Solution (25%), and BYD (15%). Samsung SDI and Panasonic share almost all of the remainder.

These batteries are integrated by companies like Bboxx, d.light and PowerGen into projects ranging from mini-grids to household installations. The sharp decline in costs, estimated at $192/kWh in 2024 by IRENA, is spurring their adoption but has not yet led to the emergence of a local industrial base. While battery storage has become a strategic link for stabilizing solar, hybrid and off-grid systems, no lithium-ion batteries are produced locally in Africa. Critical components are entirely imported.

Inverters: A Market Technically Dominated by China

The inverter, which converts the direct current from solar panels into alternating current, is an essential component. In Africa, this market is entirely dependent on imports, with a clear dominance of Asian suppliers.

Huawei and Sungrow, two Chinese manufacturers, together account for about 55% of the global market, with Huawei holding 29% and Sungrow 26%, according to Wood Mackenzie. While these figures are global, they reflect their lead in emerging markets, particularly in Africa, where their inverters are massively deployed in large solar projects.

Growatt, also a Chinese company, is making progress in the residential and off-grid segments, especially for home solar kits.

European manufacturers, notably Germany's SMA and Austria's Fronius, have seen their global market share drop to 5% to 7%, and their African presence is now marginal, limited to co-financed projects or those with high technical requirements. To date, no industrial-scale inverter assembly unit is operational in Africa. Critical components such as power electronics, control software and converters are systematically imported. This technological bottleneck is hindering the development of local capacity and extending the continent's dependency.

The Stakes of a Local Technological Base in Africa

As the continent seeks to secure access to energy in a context where 600 million people still lack it, mastering technology is becoming a key issue. Without efforts to develop a local industrial base, Africa will remain dependent on equipment, just as it has historically been on refined hydrocarbons.

For over a decade, IRENA has been warning about the need for an African industrial fabric in the renewable sector. As early as 2011, it recommended focusing on the local manufacturing of solar and wind components to reduce costs, create jobs and improve the balance of trade. In its recent work, particularly with RES4Africa (Renewable Energy Solutions for Africa), the agency advocates for local content policies to reap lasting benefits from the energy transition.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/34ed2935ada8ceb679d6a9158574fc6c_S.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:06:43.326484

It’s become crisis level, and I consider it even more important than the debate over property taxes.

A recent NPR article said across the country, electricity prices have jumped more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year.

So, who’s to blame? If only it were that easy. There is no one culprit — instead it’s a handful of factors all colliding to create the highest summer bills I have ever seen. And that’s with a vigilant husband who controls the thermostat.

First, I’ll talk about what I have seen firsthand: lawmakers giving utilities more freedom each year to recoup costs from ratepayers and protect shareholders over consumers. I understand some of the requests from utilities, but customers never seem to win in the discussion.

These so-called trackers allow utility companies to adjust rates for specific costs outside of a normal base rate case before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. For instance, Hoosier power companies can recover costs related to transmission, distribution and storage system improvements. But there are many others.

Hoosiers’ electric bills spike 17.5% in one year

That means that part of my bill is paying to upgrade an aging infrastructure. Think about it like you having to replace your roof after 30 years. But in personal finances you save for that — something utilities clearly haven’t done.

Hoosiers also haven’t fully embraced all forms of power. From coal and natural gas to solar and wind, all can add to the reliability and affordability of power in Indiana. But in some cases, legislators have limited or outright banned incentives or designations for renewable options. Instead, they are going all in for small modular nuclear reactors.

I fully support exploring nuclear, but the fact is it is likely decades away from coming to fruition and does nothing to help Hoosiers now. And yet that is where legislators focused much of their effort earlier this year.

Then there are those power-hungry data centers. They seem to be popping up everywhere. While only a few of them are partially active in Indiana, many others have been proposed. They create a very real threat to power in Indiana, and I can’t see what advantages they bring to Hoosiers. They usually create a small number of jobs and long tax abatements limit their impact on the tax base.

The last thing I will mention is the rate game. Utilities come in and propose purposely high rate hikes. The Office of Utility Consumer Counselor opposes, and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approves a lower rate, but one that still adds to the burden.

This is one area where Gov. Mike Braun could have an impact. He likes to talk tough, and I hope he brings that same approach to his role over appointments on both agencies.

The agencies will have new leadership soon and he needs to make clear it’s time to start putting the consumer first — not utility shareholders. That’s harder than it looks when you see how much utilities spend in the political arena.

Beyond millions each year in direct donations to campaigns, utilities are among the top spenders on lobbying activities. And some of the state’s largest utilities also help fund the Indiana Economic Development Foundation.

There is no silver bullet. But a starting point would be for legislative leadership to clearly acknowledge the problem and commit to finding solutions.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2203483581-2048x1411.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:00:43.264351

FAQ: Battery Breakthrough Initiative When can companies apply for funding under this initiative?","Australia's $500 Million Battery Breakthrough Initiative: Transforming the Energy Landscape

Australia has taken a bold step toward revolutionizing its energy landscape with the launch of the $500 Million Battery Breakthrough Initiative. This strategic funding program represents a significant commitment to positioning Australia as a global leader in battery technology and manufacturing while leveraging the country's natural advantages in critical minerals energy transition.

The initiative, which opened for applications in August 2025, aims to create a robust domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem that spans the entire value chain—from raw material processing to finished battery products.

What is the Battery Breakthrough Initiative?

The Battery Breakthrough Initiative is a landmark $500 million investment program designed to catalyze Australia's battery manufacturing capabilities through capital grants and production incentives. Administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), this initiative represents the country's most significant commitment to date toward developing a sovereign battery industry.

""Clean energy technology is powering more and more of Australia's grid, and we must keep looking for the best and most efficient ways to store this energy,"" stated Minister Tim Ayres, Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Science. ""Batteries are a critical component of the global move to reduce carbon emissions and there is a huge opportunity for Australia to be part of this global demand.""

The initiative focuses primarily on domestic battery manufacturing across the entire value chain, with particular emphasis on high-value battery products and scaling operations. ARENA will oversee the competitive application process, evaluating proposals based on commercial viability, scalability, and potential economic impact.

As a cornerstone of the National Battery Strategy and integral part of the ""Future Made in Australia"" agenda, the initiative aims to bolster supply chain resilience while advancing Australia's emissions reduction goals through enhanced energy storage capabilities.

Why is Australia Investing in Battery Manufacturing?

Australia possesses several natural advantages that make it an ideal candidate for developing a world-class battery manufacturing industry. The country sits on vast reserves of critical minerals essential for battery production, including lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements.

""Australia's got the raw materials, a strong research sector and a range of companies deeply engaged on the role of batteries in the clean energy transition,"" noted Minister Ayres, highlighting the country's unique positioning in the global battery metals investment landscape.

Beyond raw materials, Australia's strong research sector has already demonstrated expertise in battery technology innovation. The country's growing clean energy sector creates substantial domestic demand for battery solutions, while its strategic location in the Asia-Pacific region offers access to key international markets.

From an economic perspective, the initiative promises significant opportunities for job creation across manufacturing, research, and supporting industries. By developing high-value export products and reducing reliance on imported battery technologies, Australia aims to strengthen its domestic manufacturing capabilities while capturing a greater share of the global battery value chain.

The climate and energy security benefits are equally compelling. Advanced battery storage solutions will support renewable energy integration, enhance grid stability, reduce carbon emissions, and increase energy independence—all critical factors in Australia's broader clean energy transition.

According to a news release, General Motors shattered the world record for the farthest distance traveled on a single charge for an EV. The feat was accomplished by a team of engineers who drove a 2026 Chevrolet Silverado EV Max Range for 1,059.2 miles. The previous record was held by Lucid Motors' Air Grand Touring, which travelled 749 miles on a single charge.

It's worth noting that the Silverado Max Range trim boasts an estimated range of 493 miles on a single charge. While impressive in its own right, that figure was doubled during the record run. The team of GM engineers became curious about how far they could push the vehicle after they ""optimized absolutely everything.""

""Getting this kind of range on a full charge doesn't happen by accident,"" Kurt Kelty, vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, said. ""This achievement is a great example of how far our EV technology has come, and the kind of innovation we're building on every day at GM.""

The team drove the Silverado on public roads near GM's Milford Proving Ground in southeastern Michigan before ending the run in Belle Isle in Detroit. The engineers took turns driving the truck in one-hour shifts, maintaining speeds between 20 and 25 mph.

The tweaks to the vehicle included installing a tonneau cover, switching off climate control, and conducting the test in the summer for ""optimum ambient temperature for battery efficiency.""

Jon Doremus, propulsion calibration engineering manager, reiterated that the team wanted to make the test as realistic as possible. ""If we drove it downhill the whole time, sure, we'd get insane mileage. But that's not what this was about. We wanted this to be real, on public roads,"" Doremus said.

Switching to an EV can not only help the environment by reducing pollution, but it can also save you money. In general, EVs require less maintenance than gas-powered vehicles while also eliminating the need to stop at gas stations. This can go a long way in helping people cut down on reliance on fossil fuels.

EV drivers can save even more money by installing solar panels at home. When a solar system is paired with a home charging station, owners can take full advantage of the cost savings. EnergySage offers a range of free and easy-to-use tools that can help you compare solar quotes and find the best option.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chevrolet-Silveradoimage-rec8jeXWsqKAu8n8J.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 07:59:19.108823
