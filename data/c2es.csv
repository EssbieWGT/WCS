With the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) phasing out at the end of 2025, the market faces a moment of recalibration. This will likely mean a short-term decline, but it’s far from a death knell for the industry. After all, while incentives may fade, energy demand is projected to rise sharply over the next few years and decades. And we simply can’t meet that demand without abundant, affordable, resilient, and transparent clean energy. The challenge now is ensuring that solar remains accessible and economically viable without federal incentives.

COMMENTARY

What Happens When Incentives Disappear

The phase-out of the ITC will be a stress test for the solar industry. Nearly half (45%) of Americans say they could not afford solar without federal incentives, and another 33% say it would be a financial stretch. Together, these findings suggest that roughly three-quarters of households would find solar difficult or impossible to afford without financial support. Income disparities deepen the divide: 39% of low-income households would not consider solar, compared to 13% of households earning more than $100,000 (Aurora Solar, 2025).

Yet, despite being one of the most effective clean energy incentives in U.S. history, 43% of Americans say they have heard of the ITC but don’t understand what it does, and one in three have never heard of it at all (Aurora Solar, 2025). Among those who are aware of the credit, 82% underestimated its 30% value, believing it was less than 20%.

So, for many homeowners, the ITC’s expiration may not feel like a loss because they never realized the benefit existed. For installers and developers, its end marks a shift toward strategies that can sustain adoption without depending on tax policy.

The Economics of a Post-ITC Market

The next chapter of solar has to depend less on subsidies and more on innovation. According to Ohm Analytics, residential solar demand is projected to drop by 26% in 2026, with cash- and loan-based purchases declining by nearly half, while third-party ownership (TPO) rises from 45% of installs in 2025 to nearly 70% in 2026. This shift indicates that consumers are seeking financing options that lower upfront risk and simplify decision-making.

On the installer side, the end of the ITC brings new pressure to control costs. Although hardware prices have declined significantly over the years, soft costs remained stubbornly high. They now account for nearly two-thirds of total project expenses, driven by permitting delays, change orders, and customer cancellations (MIT Energy Initiative). Industry data show that change orders alone can add up to roughly $1,200 per project, or about $200,000 annually for a mid-sized installer. Companies that streamline workflows, increase transparency in quoting, and integrate automation into design processes are positioned to succeed in this leaner, post-incentive environment.

The Policy-Proof Future of Solar

If the past two decades of federal support built the foundation for solar adoption, the next two will test its resilience. And the industry is already adapting to become “policy-proof.”

Installers are adopting AI-powered design tools that cut change orders by up to 90%, expanding point-of-sale financing, and providing clear, validated pricing in proposals. This not only cuts costs, but helps solve a persistent problem: According to the Aurora Solar 2025 Solar Snapshot, 41% of homeowners say it is difficult to find a trustworthy installer. By embracing technology and transparency installers can start to close this trust gap and gain consumer confidence in the years ahead.

Things outside the industry’s control could also lend a hand. We’re still in an era of high interest rates, and solar could benefit if they continue to come down: 67% of Millennials and Gen Z say they would be more likely to purchase or finance solar if rates declined, compared to 47% overall (Aurora Solar, 2025). This points to a larger insight, though. Multiple, innovative financing options and transparent business models that meet younger buyers where they are key to a strong solar industry.

Not Shrinking, But Maturing

As the ITC sunsets, we need to shift our focus from what’s ending to what’s beginning. Demand for electrification, energy storage, and distributed generation continues to grow, ensuring that solar will become even more critical to meeting the U.S.’s energy needs. McKinsey projects that total U.S. electricity demand will rise by nearly 25% by 2030, driven by electric vehicles, heat pumps, and expanded domestic manufacturing. That growth cannot be met without distributed solar.

The ITC may be coming to an end, but the momentum it created endures. The future of solar now depends on innovation, transparency, and adaptability to thrive no matter what policies are put in our way.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pexels-rooftop-solar-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 19:58:23.297167

Greg Abbott, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly, U.S. Rep. Jake Ellzey, and Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s global head of data center energy.
“We are making a new $40 billion investment in the Lone Star State,” Pichai said at the event.

Red Oak: Google’s second Texas data center campus is now online Google announced its Red Oak data center in 2023—its second in the state.","Google announced its largest-ever investment in any U.S. state on Friday, committing $40 billion to Texas through 2027 to add three new data center campuses and make the Lone Star State a centerpiece of its global AI data center footprint.

The announcement came at Google’s data center facility in Midlothian, where Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai joined Gov. Greg Abbott, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly, U.S. Rep. Jake Ellzey, and Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s global head of data center energy.

“We are making a new $40 billion investment in the Lone Star State,” Pichai said at the event. “This includes plans for three new data center campuses, one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County.”

The investment bundles cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, energy capacity initiatives, continued buildout in North Texas, and workforce training programs.

“This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state,” Abbott said. “Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy.” The investment, he said, is “Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state.”

Google makes Texas its AI infrastructure anchor

“Texas will be the centerpiece for AI data centers for Google,” said Abbott.

Pichai explained why Texas was selected for the massive investment. “Data centers of that scale require a few things: good, pro-innovation regulatory environments, land, and especially energy,” he said in Midlothian. “Happily, we found all three in Texas.”

Thanking Abbott for “leading the way,” Pichai added, “They say everything is bigger in Texas, and I think that applies to the golden opportunity with AI, the optimism, the talent, the policy environment, and the innovation needed to lead this new era and create immense benefits for everyone.”

The multi-billion-dollar investment will “create thousands of jobs, provide skills training to college students and electrical apprentices, and accelerate energy affordability initiatives throughout Texas,” he said.

The three new West Texas data centers expand Google’s data center footprint, which already includes Ellis County campuses in Midlothian and Red Oak. Google has maintained a Texas presence for more than 15 years, Pichai said, with thousands of employees across the state and offices in Dallas, Austin, and Houston.

Net-positive power additions to the grid and Google’s “first industrial park”

Energy strategy emerged as a central theme of the announcement, with Google committing to be a net-positive contributor to the Texas grid as it builds out new AI infrastructure.

“When we invest in data centers, part of our core strategy is to invest significantly in new energy capacity, which increases supply and ensures grid abundance for everyone,” Pichai said from the podium. “In Texas, we work with local utility partners to add more than 6,200 megawatts of net new energy generation and capacity to the grid to keep costs low.”

According to Google’s news release, the company has power purchase agreements with energy developers such as AES Corporation, Enel North America, Clearway, ENGIE, Intersect, SB Energy, Ørsted, and X-Elio.

Abbott noted Google has provided a net new addition of five gigawatts of power to the Texas grid so far — and committed to be net positive to the power grid as the build continues, “making sure we have the reliability and the supply that Texas needs to keep the lights on for all of our fellow Texans.”

In terms of energy scale, 5 gigawatts is equivalent to 5,000 megawatts.

One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built directly alongside a new solar and battery energy storage plant. Pichai said Google’s first industrial park, developed through a partnership with Intersect Power, will be co-located at the Haskell data center. “Co-locating energy supply with data center load has some powerful benefits. It can unlock the development of new transmission infrastructure and optimize utilization of the existing grid,” he said.

Google announced its industrial park partnership with Intersect and TPG Rise Climate last year, described as a strategic collaboration to develop “powered land” to allow the data center to run mostly on carbon-free electricity produced nearby.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy on AI’s power demands

James Danly, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy and the second-highest official at the Department of Energy, used the Midlothian announcement to zoom out to the national stakes of AI’s rising power needs.

“We’re going to need 100 gigawatts over the next number of years in order to satisfy the demand as we projected,” he said, noting the investment comes “at the same time as the President’s agenda focuses on ensuring safe, reliable, affordable, secure power for everybody, in abundance.”

In the company’s news release, Danly framed Google’s move as directly tied to that agenda. “This historic investment from Google advances this administration’s goal of winning the AI race,” he said in a statement. “Google is working to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance, economic competitiveness and national security while ensuring that energy remains reliable, affordable and secure.”

Danly also pointed to Texas policy as a key enabler of projects on this scale. “This is a state that has ensured energy abundance for everybody. It has made it possible to deploy new resources rapidly,” he said. “This is a model for how such projects should be done going forward, and the United States is going to be put in a very good position as a result of such projects.”

Pichai also tied the announcement to federal policy and thanked the administration. “We won’t be here without the leadership of President Trump and the White House AI action plan,” he said.

‘We’ve known how great it is’

With the announcement just a few days after Veterans Day, U.S. Rep. Jake Ellzey opened his remarks by sharing Danly’s service record with the crowd. He reminded them that Danly went to Yale, joined the Army, and that the two men served in Iraq at the same time in 2006, where Danly was in combat and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.

Ellzey—a Republican representing Texas’ 6th Congressional District, including Midlothian and the surrounding area—kept his remarks close to home and tied the moment back to the people on stage.

“You’ve come a long way from Madras to Midlothian, and we’re glad that you’re here,” Ellzey told the Google CEO, noting that Pichai took over the company the same year Abbott became governor. “Who knew that today we would be talking about this $40 billion investment in Texas, but also in Midlothian. For many, many years, we’ve known how great it is, and now you guys are seeing it too.”

He also reminded the audience that Abbott’s own story runs through North Texas, pointing out that the governor is from nearby Duncanville and, as a high school senior, was voted “most likely to succeed.”

Ellzey then described the campus for those who hadn’t had a tour. About a year ago, he said, he walked through the buildings behind the stage and was struck by how familiar they felt. “I walked in and said, this looks exactly like an aircraft carrier,” he recalled.

When he asked who the workers were, he was told, “We were nuclear sailors in the United States,” adding that much of the technology is similar to that of a nuclear aircraft carrier. “So you have a very highly skilled, talented group of people working here.”

From there, Ellzey turned to how the project came together and the locals who helped land it.

The congressman named more than a dozen current and former Midlothian mayors and city council members, along with City Manager Chris Dick and others, for supporting the development. “This doesn’t happen without local leaders, citizens, and the employees of Alphabet and Google,” he said. “We all know Midlothian is a great place. Now the rest of the world knows too.”

Then he addressed a question on many minds: How do you power all this?

“A lot of people worry about these data centers. Where is the power going to come from?” he said. “We’re working together with the state, [with Google], and with the Secretary of Energy, to make sure that these places are powered on their own.”

Ellzey summed up what the investment means for residents in a statement released alongside the event. “Google’s investment here in Midlothian is a real boost for our community. It brings good jobs, new opportunities, and steady growth for families across our district,” he said. “Texas keeps showing why it’s the place to build and invest: low taxes, a strong workforce, and a can-do spirit you won’t find anywhere else.”

$30 million energy impact fund for affordability and energy workforce

Beyond the three new data centers, Pichai also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund starting in 2026.

“This fund is designed to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives throughout Texas,” Pichai said. “For the next three years, starting in 2026, we’ll work with community partners and local organizations with a focus on energy costs, weatherization for homes and public schools, and building the energy workforce of the future.”

Google said it will establish a funding application process for community partners and local organizations.

In a news release, the company also detailed water and agriculture commitments tied to the expansion. Once complete, the three new facilities in Armstrong and Haskell counties will use advanced air-cooling technology, limiting water use to site operations such as kitchens, Google said.

Beyond its direct operations, Google is contributing $2.6 million to help Texas Water Trade create and enhance up to 1,000 acres of wetlands along the Trinity–San Jacinto Estuary and deliver approximately 300 million gallons of freshwater annually in southeastern Texas.

Additionally, Google said it is providing more than $2 million to support agriculture in Texas, including a regenerative agriculture program with Indigo Ag in the Dallas–Fort Worth area and an irrigation efficiency project with N-Drip in the Texas High Plains, according to the company.

AI Opportunity Fund: Training 1,700-plus electricians by 2030

The new AI and energy infrastructure will need trained people to build and maintain it, Pichai said.

Google’s workforce development strategy aims to increase the projected pipeline of new electricians in Texas by nearly 110%. “Our data center investments increase the need for electricians to help build that workforce pipeline,” Pichai said. “We are supporting the electrical training ALLIANCE (etA), which will train more than 1,700 new apprentices by 2030.”

That education effort will receive funding from Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund, according to the company. The initiative aims to boost the number of apprentices in Texas, integrate AI tools into the training curriculum, and train both existing electrical workers and apprentices in the state.

“Our country, our world, is going to be hinged to electrons,” Abbott said. The engineers and electricians who will be getting this education, will be needed, “literally, for the rest of their lives,” he added.

Free AI training: Google AI for Education Accelerator

The workforce development builds on the work Google is doing with leading institutions in the state that help prepare students with critical AI and job ready skills, Pichai told attendees.

“We are giving Longhorns, Aggies, Bobcats, and many other Texas-based college students access to Google career certificates and AI training courses at no cost,” he said, adding there’s “no in-state rivalry here.”

According to Google, The University of Texas, Texas A&M, and Texas State University systems, along with Dallas College and South Texas College, are among the universities and colleges in the first cohort of the Google AI for Education Accelerator, giving students, faculty, and staff no-cost access to Google Career Certificates and AI training courses.

Google also committed $7 million in grants to support AI-related initiatives in healthcare, energy, and education across Texas. That includes helping CareMessage enhance rural healthcare access, enabling The University of Texas at Austin and Texas Tech University to address energy challenges, and expanding AI training for Texas educators and students through support to Houston Community College.

To date, Google said it has provided funding to local organizations that have trained more than 1 million residents in digital skills, the company said.

Thousands of construction and permanent jobs

Pichai said the company also supports “countless more jobs” across the state through its work with local businesses. The company’s investments and technologies helped provide more than $50 billion of activity for Texas businesses, nonprofits, publishers, creators, and developers in 2024, according to the company.

Google said it is continuing to invest in its existing Ellis County data centers in Midlothian and Red Oak, as it builds out its three new West Texas facilities. The company’s continued investment in Texas projects over many years will also support thousands of construction jobs, Pichai said.

“This project will do nothing but expand Texas’ lead nationally for new jobs,” Abbott said, noting the state’s continued number one rankings for the most new jobs, the best state for doing business, and the most economic development projects.

“We appreciate all the jobs that you’re bringing here, but equally appreciate the training, the high skilled level training is going to be needed to fulfill these jobs, he said.

Abbott also leaned into the idea of the state as a fast-moving partner.

“Texas is a partner with our businesses, large and small, and we will insist on continuing to move at the speed of business so that you will finish this project ahead of schedule and under budget,” Abbott said.

AI powering everyday Texas businesses

Abbott moved the conversation from megawatts and megaprojects to everyday life.

“Some people are confused about what AI really does, and this term ‘hyperscalers,'” he said. “Your local McDonald’s is going to be using it to better enable their business to function. Your local stores, your local grocery stores, your local HEB, and things like that are all going to be operating better because of AI generated right here in the middle of Texas.”

Pichai connected the same dots from Google’s side of the house, tying the new infrastructure to services people already use.

“Data centers power the Google products people use every day: search, YouTube, maps, and the Gemini app,” he said. “And now they are powering an exciting new era of AI innovation that is leading scientific breakthroughs, including new cancer therapies and drug discoveries.”

Pichai also pointed to other Google-backed services expanding across the state.

“Waymo, the world’s first autonomous ridesharing service is available in Austin, and we plan to expand to Dallas next year. Our growing delivery service, Wing, and Walmart are completing thousands of deliveries each week in the Dallas area,” he said. “Our growing Dallas cloud region delivers high-performance, low-latency services to companies like NRG Energy.”

Google launched its Dallas Cloud Region in 2022 as part of a global network of 42 cloud regions that businesses and organizations use to build and scale AI-powered solutions.

Alphabet’s life science offshoot, Verily, also moved its headquarters from California to Dallas in 2024.

Local officials embrace “generational investment”

Amanda Peterson Corio, Google’s global head of data center energy and a Texas native, told the audience that in her 10 years at the company, she’s seen how data center projects can affect communities like Midlothian and Red Oak.

Google has a “resolute strategy to ensure that Texas continues to lead the American Revolution,” she said, “through next generation, AI infrastructure, a robust energy and power market, and, most importantly, a future-ready talent pool.” She added that local leaders and community partners are essential to making projects like this possible.

Officials from Armstrong and Haskell counties—the Texas communities set to host Google’s newest data centers—framed the company’s commitment as transformational.

In a statement, Armstrong County Judge Adam Ensey called the announcement of a major Google data center campus a “generational opportunity that puts the West Texas region directly in the forefront of the global digital economy” by powering the future of innovation alongside the community’s farming and ranching heritage.

Haskell County Judge Kenny Thompson added that Google’s investment in his community will transform the quality of life for its citizens and “provide long term stability” for all cities within the county infrastructure, offering “top-tier” employment opportunities for people to remain in the county.

Google’s first Texas data center: Midlothian

As Google looks west to new campuses in Armstrong and Haskell counties, Dallas-Fort Worth leaders say the company’s existing footprint has already reshaped parts of the region.

Midlothian’s data center story dates back to a 375-acre land acquisition in Railport Business Park reported in 2018. Google officially announced its plans to invest $600 million to develop its first Texas data center in 2019, with a groundbreaking ceremony that brought together local leaders and company officials.

Current Midlothian Mayor Justin Coffman said Google’s commitment has extended well beyond the “facility fence line.” The company’s presence is a “catalyst for long-term economic development, not only through capital investment but by attracting the kind of high-tech ecosystem that diversifies our economy and creates sustainable opportunities for the next generation of Midlothian families,” he said in a statement.

Red Oak: Google’s second Texas data center campus is now online

Google announced its Red Oak data center in 2023—its second in the state. On Friday, Goothe company also announced that the first building of the Red Oak campus in Ellis County is now operational.

Red Oak Mayor Mark Stanfill described the project as a partnership built on shared values. Beyond Google’s capital investment in Red Oak, Stanfill said the company has made a commitment to the community with support for the Red Oak Public Schools and the new Maker Space at the Red Oak Public Library.

“These contributions are equipping our students and residents with the high-demand digital skills necessary for the modern workforce, guaranteeing that the jobs created here benefit the people who live here,” Stanfill said.

“Investing in America”

Google said the investment is part of its “Investing in America” initiative, which is “furthering American innovation through major investments in technical infrastructure, research and development, expanded energy capacity for an AI-driven economy, and workforce development to help the U.S. continue to lead the world in AI.”

The move also puts Texas deeper into the national AI infrastructure race.

Last week, Anthropic also announced a $50 billion plan for new U.S. data centers, with initial sites planned for Texas and New York. In October, Meta said it would invest $1.5 billion in a new AI data center in El Paso—its third in Texas—bringing its total data center investment in the state to about $10 billion. OpenAI’s Stargate facility in Abilene—announced at the White House in January in a joint venture with Oracle and Softbank—is set to become the “world’s largest AI supercluster,” with five additional U.S. sites planned.

“We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen,” Abbott said.

Ferry operator, Encounter Maria Island, which is part of the Navigators Group, has been supported by the Tasmanian Government with $650,000 funding.

Minister for Energy and Renewables, Nick Duigan, said the project aligns perfectly with the Tasmanian Future Clean Fuels Strategy.

“This project pioneers green methanol fuel use and advances Tasmania’s reputation for clean fuel maritime technology,” Minister Duigan said.

“Tasmania is charting a clean fuels future. This ferry has far lower emissions than diesel, which is why we’re supporting innovators like Encounter Maria Island to lead the way.

“This is a great example of how business and Government can work together to deliver for Tasmania.

“Green methanol is an emerging solution for reducing global marine emissions. This project puts Tasmania on the map as one of the first regions in Australia to deploy it at scale.”

Navigator’s decision to pursue best-practice technology confirms the Tasmanian Government has the right policy, regulatory measures and support initiatives to encourage the industry to make better decisions.

The green methanol is planned be sourced from the Bell Bay Powerfuels Project or the HIF Global E-fuels plant in Burnie.

Comments attributable to Navigators CEO, John Roche:

“We have spent years researching and examining options for future fuels for a ferry of this type and size, and battery electric, or hydrogen fuel cell electric propulsion systems didn’t stack up for a variety of operational, technological, regulatory and cost reasons,"" Mr Roche said.

“First stage will be implementing a best practice, lowest emissions possible solution while green methanol engines and fuel becomes available. Once available, the vessel will be ready for the transition to future fuels.

“A vessel has a life of over 30 years, and we know that in this period diesel will not be the fuel of choice.”

The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said.","BELEM, Brazil — Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren’t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action - on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more - including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva - the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad as it could be.”

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

Enter South Korea, where Jeju Province has started a pilot program to repurpose EV batteries for agricultural machinery as well as energy storage systems, according to Korea Biz Wire.

The program will provide 100 devices, including farm equipment, transport robots, and streetlights, that will be powered by the repurposed batteries in eight rural villages referred to as ""energy-poor.""

Batteries must pass a certification check to ensure they still have at least 60% capacity. Jeju Province is also building a national battery resource center, pending a 13 billion won ($94 million) budget approval from parliament.

South Korea is working to raise its recycling rate for important minerals to 20% by 2030, an important goal as officials project an increase in retired EV batteries by the same year (from 8,300 to 107,000 units).

Repurposing and recycling EV batteries is important because the metals and minerals that go into them, like nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese, require invasive mining.

These resources are also often located in regions that have ongoing human rights issues, like Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, per the BBC. Recycling these materials means less mining could be required, cutting down on the negative human and environmental impacts.

For the average driver, improved recycling for EV batteries will help with long-term costs, making new batteries more affordable. It also prevents them from ending up in landfills, where they can release harmful pollutants into the water, air, and soil.

EVs are cleaner to drive in general. Even if charging a battery comes from a power plant where pollution is increased, the overall total pollution is still less than that of a traditional gas car, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The United States — the world’s biggest economy, top oil and gas producer and second-largest climate polluter — is pursuing a fossil fuel renaissance while forsaking plans to shift toward renewables.
The developed world is continuing to move in the wrong direction on fossil fuels, climate activists say.
“We know that the world’s richest countries are continuing to invest in oil and gas development,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist who founded Climate Analytics, a policy group.
At last year’s climate talks in Azerbaijan, they upped the ante to $300 billion per year by 2035.","Days after the gathering started last week, nations were still sorting out what to do with contentious issues that have typically held up the annual negotiations. As the talks opened, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the world must “fight” efforts to deny the reality of climate change — decades after scientists concluded that people are making the Earth hotter.

That led one official to offer a grim assessment of global efforts to tackle climate change, 10 years after an earlier summit produced the sweeping Paris Agreement.

“We have miserably failed to accomplish the objective of this convention, which is the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama’s climate envoy and lead negotiator, during an interview at the conference site in Belém, Brazil.

“Additional promises mean nothing if you didn’t achieve or fulfill your previous promises,” he added.

It hasn’t helped that the U.S. is skipping the summit for the first time, or that President Donald Trump dismisses climate change as a hoax and urged the world to abandon efforts to fix it. But Trump isn’t the only reason for stalled action. Economic uncertainty, infighting and political backsliding have stymied green measures in both North America and Europe.

In other parts of the world, countries are embracing the economic opportunities that the green transition offers. Many officials in Belém point to signs that progress is underway, including the rapid growth of renewables and electric vehicles and a broader understanding of both the world’s challenges and the means to address them.

“Now we talk about solar panels, electric cars, regenerative agriculture, stopping deforestation, as if we have always talked about those things,” said Ana Toni, the summit’s executive director. “Just in one decade, the topic changed totally. But we still need to speed up the process.”

Still, analysts say it’s become inevitable that the world’s warming will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius since the dawn of the industrial era, breaching the target at the heart of the Paris Agreement. With that in mind, countries are huddling at this month’s summit, known as COP30, with the hope of finding greater alignment on how to slow rising temperatures.

But how credible would any promises reached in Brazil be? Here are five pledges achieved at past climate summits — and where they stand now:

Moving away from fossil fuels

The historic 2023 agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels, made at the COP28 talks in Dubai, was the first time that nearly 200 countries agreed to wind down their use of oil, natural gas and coal. Though nonbinding, that commitment was even more striking because the talks were overseen by the chief executive of the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company.

Just two years later, fossil fuel consumption is on the rise, despite rapid growth of wind and solar, and many of the world’s largest oil and gas producers plan to drill even more. The United States — the world’s biggest economy, top oil and gas producer and second-largest climate polluter — is pursuing a fossil fuel renaissance while forsaking plans to shift toward renewables.

The president of the Dubai summit, Sultan al-Jaber, said at a recent energy conference that while wind and solar would expand, so too would oil and gas, in part to meet soaring demand for data centers. Liquefied natural gas would grow 65 percent by 2050, and oil will continue to be used as a feedstock for plastic, he said.

“The exponential growth of AI is also creating a power surge that no one anticipated 18 months ago,” he said in a press release from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., where he remains managing director and group CEO.

The developed world is continuing to move in the wrong direction on fossil fuels, climate activists say.

“We know that the world’s richest countries are continuing to invest in oil and gas development,” said Bill Hare, a climate scientist who founded Climate Analytics, a policy group. “This simply should not be happening.”

The Paris-based International Energy Agency said last week that oil and gas demand could grow for decades to come. That statement marked a reversal from the group’s previous forecast that oil use would peak in 2030 as clean energy takes hold. Trump’s policies are one reason for the pivot.

Still, renewables such as wind and solar power are soaring in many countries, leading analysts to believe that nations will continue to shift away from fossil fuels. How quickly that will happen is unknown.

“The transition is underway but not yet at the pace or scale required,” said a U.N. report on global climate action released last week. It pointed to large gaps in efforts to reduce fossil fuel subsidies and abate methane pollution.

Lula opened this year’s climate conference by calling for a “road map” to cut fossil fuels globally. It has earned support from countries such as Colombia, Germany, Kenya and the United Kingdom. But it’s not part of the official agenda at these talks, and many poorer countries say what they really need is funding and support to make the shift.

Triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency

This call also emerged from the 2023 summit, and was considered a tangible measure of countries’ progress toward achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets.

Countries are on track to meet the pledge to triple their renewable energy capacity by 2030, thanks largely to a record surge in solar power, according to energy think tank Ember.

It estimates that the world is set to add around 793 gigawatts of new renewable capacity in 2025, up from 717 gigawatts in 2024, driven mainly by China.

“If this pace continues, annual additions now only need to grow by around 12 percent a year from 2026 to 2030 to reach tripling, compared with 21 percent originally needed,” said Dave Jones, Ember’s chief analyst. “But governments will need to strengthen commitments to lock this in.”

The pledge to double the world’s energy efficiency by 2030, by contrast, is a long way behind. While efficiency improvements would need to grow by 4 percent a year to reach that target, they hit only 1 percent in 2024.

‘Loss and damage’ fund

When the landmark fund for victims of climate disasters was established at the 2022 talks in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, it offered promise that billions of dollars would someday flow to nations slammed by hurricanes, droughts or rising seas.

Three years later, it has less than $800 million — only a little more than it had in 2023.

Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, excoriated leaders this month for not providing more. Her rebuke came little more than a week after Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever seen in the Atlantic, swept across the Caribbean.

“All of us should hold our heads down in shame, because having established this fund a few years ago in Sharm El-Sheikh, its capital base is still under $800 million while Jamaica reels from damage in excess of $7 billion, not to mention Cuba or the Bahamas,” she said.

Last week, the fund announced it was allocating $250 million for financial requests to help less-wealthy nations grapple with “damage from slow onset and extreme climate-induced events.” The fund’s executive director, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, said the call for contributions was significant but also a reminder that the fund needs much more money.

Richard Muyungi, chair for the African Group of Negotiators and Tanzania’s climate envoy, said he expects additional funds will come from this summit, though not the billions needed.

“There is a chance that the fund will run out of money by next year, year after next, before it even is given a chance to replenish itself,” said Michai Robertson, a senior finance adviser for the Alliance of Small Island States.

Global Methane Pledge

Backed by the U.S. and European Union, this pledge to cut global methane emissions 30 percent by 2030 was launched four years ago at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, sparking a wave of talk about the benefits of cutting methane, a greenhouse gas with a relatively short shelf life but much greater warming potential than carbon dioxide.

“The Global Methane Pledge has been instrumental in catalyzing attention to the issue of methane, because it has moved from a niche issue to one of the critical elements of the climate planning discussions,” said Giulia Ferrini, head of the U.N. Environment Program’s International Methane Emissions Observatory.

“All the tools are there,” she added. “It’s just a question of political will.”

Methane emissions from the oil and gas sector remain stubbornly high, despite the economic benefits of bringing them down, according to the IEA. The group’s latest methane tracker shows that energy-based methane pollution was around 120 million tons in 2024, roughly the same as a year earlier.

Despite more than 150 nations joining the Global Methane Pledge, few countries or companies have devised plans to meet their commitments, “and even fewer have demonstrated verifiable emissions reductions,” the IEA said.

The European Union’s methane regulation requires all oil and gas operators to measure, report and verify their emissions, including importers. And countries and companies are becoming more diligent about complying with an international satellite program that notifies companies and countries of methane leaks so they can repair them. Responses went from just 1 percent of alerts last year to 12 percent so far in 2025.

More work is needed to achieve the 2030 goal, the U.N. says. Meanwhile, U.S. officials have pressured the EU to rethink its methane curbs.

Barbados and several other countries are calling for a binding methane pact similar to the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 agreement that’s widely credited with saving the ozone layer by phasing out the use of harmful pollutants.

That’s something Paris Agreement architect Laurence Tubiana hopes could happen.

“I’m just in favor of tackling this very seriously, because the pledge doesn’t work [well] enough,” she said.

Climate finance

In 2009, wealthy countries agreed to provide $100 billion annually until 2025 to help poorer nations deal with rising temperatures. At last year’s climate talks in Azerbaijan, they upped the ante to $300 billion per year by 2035.

But those countries delivered the $100 billion two years late, and many nations viewed the new $300 billion commitment with disappointment. India, which expressed particular ire about last year’s outcome, is pushing for new discussions in Brazil to get that money flowing.

“Finance really is at the core of everything that we do,” Ali Mohamed, Kenya’s climate envoy, told POLITICO’s E&E News. But he also recognizes that governments alone are not the answer. “We cannot say finance must only come from the public sector.”

Last year’s pledge included a call for companies and multilateral development banks to contribute a sum exceeding $1 trillion by 2035, but much of that would be juiced by donor nations — and more countries would need to contribute.

That is more important now, said Jake Werksman, the EU’s lead negotiator.

“As you know, one of the larger contributors to this process, the U.S., has essentially shut down all development flows from the U.S. budget, and no other party, including the EU, can make up for that gap,” he said during a press conference.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5b%2Fed%2Fc5e2173d4eabb3f1f32786d47230%2Fclimate-cop30-92558.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:38.103452

Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.

Much of the discussion is about data centers, which are often large developments used to support cloud computing or artificial intelligence. But the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.

“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”

I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.

Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.

Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.

It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.

Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.

Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.

He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”

He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.

Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.

“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.

The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.

Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.

“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.

Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.

But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.

From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.

Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohioapproved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.

Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is“disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.

In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocatejointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.

That’s the vision V2G proponents have been describing for years, and projects like Redwood Coast Airport are making it real.
The missing piece is widespread deployment—and that’s exactly what projects like Redwood Coast Airport are helping to enable.","A groundbreaking vehicle-to-grid project at California’s Redwood Coast Airport is demonstrating how electric vehicles can serve as more than just transportation—they’re becoming mobile power plants that strengthen grid resilience and reduce costs.

PG&E, Nissan, Fermata Energy, and the Schatz Energy Research Center at Cal Poly Humboldt have successfully integrated two previous-generation Nissan Leaf electric vehicles into the airport’s existing microgrid infrastructure in McKinleyville, California, reports ARS Technica. The 2020 and 2021 Leaf models, equipped with CHAdeMO quick charge ports, connect to four bidirectional FE-20 charging stations that can both charge the vehicles and draw power from their batteries.

How the V2G System Works

The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid, which has been operating since 2021, already features a 2.2 MW solar array and 8.9 MWh of battery storage, along with a 300 kW net-metered solar system. The two-vehicle Nissan Leaf fleet adds another layer of flexibility and capacity to this sophisticated energy system.

When county staff aren’t using the Leafs for work activities, the vehicles plug into Fermata Energy’s FE-20 bidirectional chargers. These specialized units can charge at 20 kW and discharge at the same rate, transforming the EVs into distributed energy resources. The system uses Fermata’s intelligent V2X platform to optimize when to charge, discharge, or hold battery capacity based on grid conditions and electricity prices.

“Integrating bidirectional chargers and EVs at the Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid is an innovative solution that will expand the capacity of the site, extending the capability for powering the airport during local grid outages and providing another clean energy resource for ensuring statewide grid stability,” said Mike Delaney, Vice President of Utility Partnerships and Innovation at PG&E.

Real-World Performance and Revenue Generation

The vehicles serve multiple purposes beyond basic transportation. During normal operations, they participate in California’s Emergency Load Reduction Program, generating revenue for Humboldt County by responding to grid stress events. When electricity prices are high during peak demand periods, the system can draw power from the parked EVs’ batteries, helping to reduce the county’s utility bills through strategic energy management.

When the microgrid operates in “island mode”—disconnected from the main grid during outages—the Nissan Leafs respond to changes in grid frequency, either injecting power when needed or absorbing excess solar energy depending on their battery levels. This automatic frequency response is crucial for maintaining stable power delivery to the airport and adjacent U.S. Coast Guard Air Station.

The Coast Guard facility oversees search and rescue operations for 250 miles of rural coastline, from the Mendocino-Sonoma county line to the California-Oregon border. Since roads into Humboldt County are frequently closed by fires and landslides, maintaining airport operations during emergencies is literally a matter of life and death.

Battle-Tested Technology

The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid has already proven its worth under extreme conditions. On December 20, 2022, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake knocked out power to more than 70,000 electric customers in Humboldt County. The microgrid automatically disconnected from the grid and provided power to the airport and Coast Guard station for nearly 15 hours—despite facing worst-case conditions.

The earthquake struck at the winter solstice after the batteries had discharged during evening peak demand, leaving them at their lowest charge level. Weather conditions were overcast and rainy, limiting solar generation. Despite these challenges, the system performed flawlessly, allowing the Coast Guard to conduct rescue operations while most of the county remained in the dark.

Since then, the microgrid has been called into service multiple times during winter storm outages, sometimes running for less than 30 minutes and other times operating for eight hours or more. The addition of the bidirectional EV charging capability further enhances this proven resilience.

Industry Leadership in V2G Technology

The FE-20 bidirectional chargers represent the latest generation of Fermata Energy’s technology. The predecessor FE-15 model helped reduce electricity bills by more than $9,450 over four years at Nissan’s Americas Headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee—averaging nearly $2,000 in annual savings. The enhanced FE-20 is expected to deliver even better performance.

“At Fermata Energy, we see a real opportunity to transform electric vehicles from simple modes of transportation into critical energy assets,” said Hamza Lemsaddek, Chief Operating Officer of Fermata Energy. “By integrating our intelligent V2X platform and bidirectional chargers, we are delivering measurable cost savings, valuable grid services and enhanced local energy resilience.”

Nissan has been a pioneer in bidirectional charging capability. The Leaf became the first fully bidirectional-capable electric vehicle launched in the U.S. when it debuted with CHAdeMO V2G capability in 2013. All Nissan Leaf vehicles from model year 2013 and later are compatible with bidirectional charging, though the infrastructure to support V2G has been slow to develop.

There are currently over 30 proven V2G installations across the United States using Fermata Energy chargers and Nissan Leaf vehicles, aimed at helping fleets and dealerships optimize energy usage and reduce costs.

Technical Innovation and Future Implications

The Redwood Coast Airport project is jointly operated by PG&E and the Redwood Coast Energy Authority, Humboldt County’s local Community Choice Aggregator. The collaboration required developing new operating agreements and tariff structures that have informed PG&E’s Community Microgrid Enablement Program—a framework that could serve as a blueprint for similar projects across California and beyond.

“We are proud to have led the technical integration of this important pilot project that advances local resiliency and deep decarbonization and can play an important role in the community microgrids that are being developed across California’s rural north coast and beyond,” said David Carter, principal engineer at the Schatz Energy Research Center at Cal Poly Humboldt.

The project demonstrates that V2G technology is not just a concept for the future—it’s operational today and providing tangible benefits. The system shows how older EV models can contribute to grid stability and energy resilience, extending their utility beyond personal transportation.

For Humboldt County, the technology offers multiple advantages: reduced electricity costs, backup power during emergencies, participation in grid services that generate revenue, and enhanced community resilience. The county staff can use the vehicles normally for work activities, then plug them in to serve as energy assets when parked.

The CHAdeMO Advantage and Limitation

The project relies on CHAdeMO, the Japanese DC fast charging standard that includes native V2G capability in its protocol specification. While CHAdeMO has become less common as CCS (Combined Charging System) has gained market dominance in North America and Europe, it remains the only charging standard with widespread bidirectional capability deployed in production vehicles.

This presents both an opportunity and a challenge. On one hand, hundreds of thousands of Nissan Leafs on the road today (model year 2013 and later) could theoretically participate in V2G programs with the right infrastructure. On the other hand, most new EVs are moving to CCS connectors, which will require updated standards and vehicle hardware to enable widespread bidirectional charging.

The Nissan Leaf, despite being an older design that has been surpassed by newer EVs in range and features, continues to hold unique value precisely because of its bidirectional charging capability. As battery costs continue to fall and EV adoption accelerates, the ability to use parked vehicles as distributed energy storage could become increasingly valuable for grid management.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

The V2G integration at Redwood Coast Airport offers a glimpse into a possible future where millions of electric vehicles contribute to grid stability and renewable energy integration. During the day, excess solar power can charge vehicle batteries. In the evening, when solar generation drops but electricity demand peaks, those same batteries can discharge to meet demand—reducing reliance on fossil fuel “peaker” plants that utilities typically fire up during high-demand periods.

This time-shifting of renewable energy helps address one of the key challenges of solar power: its generation doesn’t always align with when people need electricity. Battery storage solves this problem, and parked EVs represent an enormous potential storage resource. With an average EV battery capacity of 60-100 kWh, even a small fleet can provide meaningful energy storage capacity.

The economic model is compelling. Humboldt County receives both transportation vehicles and energy storage capacity from the same assets. During grid stress events, they earn revenue by participating in demand response programs. They save money through strategic charging and discharging based on time-of-use electricity rates. And they gain energy resilience that has already proven lifesaving during natural disasters.

Regulatory and Infrastructure Challenges

Despite the proven success at Redwood Coast Airport, V2G faces significant barriers to widespread adoption. Utility interconnection processes can be complicated and time-consuming. Building codes and local regulations often weren’t written with bidirectional charging in mind. Insurance and liability questions remain partially unresolved.

Most significantly, automakers have been slow to embrace bidirectional charging beyond Nissan. Ford’s F-150 Lightning offers vehicle-to-home capability but requires proprietary equipment. GM has announced plans for V2G capability but hasn’t delivered production systems yet. Tesla, despite early promises, has yet to enable bidirectional charging in any of its vehicles.

The charging infrastructure also needs to expand dramatically. While unidirectional DC fast chargers are becoming more common, bidirectional chargers remain rare and expensive. Standardization efforts are underway, but the industry hasn’t yet coalesced around a single approach for CCS-based V2G systems.

California’s regulatory environment, however, provides some advantages. The state has been progressive in creating programs and tariff structures that allow V2G participation. The California Public Utilities Commission has explored various mechanisms to compensate EV owners for providing grid services. And programs like the Emergency Load Reduction Program create revenue opportunities for V2G participants.

What This Means for the Future

The Redwood Coast Airport project serves as a proof of concept that could inform much larger deployments. If the model can work for two Nissan Leafs at a rural airport, it could potentially scale to fleet vehicles at businesses, school buses, delivery vans, or even residential EVs.

Imagine a future where your parked EV at home helps stabilize the local grid, earns you a few dollars per month, and serves as backup power during outages—all while remaining fully charged and ready to drive whenever you need it. That’s the vision V2G proponents have been describing for years, and projects like Redwood Coast Airport are making it real.

For California, which has aggressive renewable energy and EV adoption targets, V2G technology could prove essential for grid management. As more solar and wind power comes online, and as millions of EVs start charging regularly, the grid will need flexible resources that can balance supply and demand. Parked EVs could fill that role, turning a potential grid challenge into a solution.

The technology is proven. The economics are increasingly favorable. The regulatory frameworks are developing. The missing piece is widespread deployment—and that’s exactly what projects like Redwood Coast Airport are helping to enable.

EVXL’s Take

The Redwood Coast Airport V2G project represents exactly the kind of practical innovation that could accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation and energy systems. While we’ve covered Nissan’s involvement in V2G initiatives before—including when they joined ChargeScape as an equal investor alongside BMW, Ford, and Honda in October 2024—seeing the technology deployed at critical infrastructure like an airport demonstrates its real-world viability.

The timing of this project is particularly noteworthy given the challenges facing EV adoption and grid infrastructure. With concerns about grid capacity to handle widespread EV charging, bidirectional technology flips the script: EVs become part of the solution rather than just another demand on the system. The fact that this is working with older Nissan Leaf models rather than cutting-edge new vehicles also sends an important message about the value proposition of existing EV fleets.

What’s especially compelling about the Redwood Coast implementation is its performance during the December 2022 earthquake. When 70,000 customers lost power, this system kept the airport and Coast Guard station operational under worst-case conditions—low battery charge, minimal solar generation, and winter weather. That’s not a lab demonstration or theoretical model; it’s proven resilience when lives were on the line.

The broader implications for EVXL readers are significant. As automakers continue to introduce more EVs with bidirectional capability, and as companies like ChargeScape build out the platform infrastructure to manage V2G systems, we’re likely to see much wider deployment of this technology. In fact, ChargeScape is already enabling EV owners to earn money while they sleep through smart charging programs—with some drivers potentially earning up to $3,000 per year through bidirectional power-sharing.

Fleet operators, in particular, should be paying close attention—school buses, delivery vehicles, and other fleets that sit parked for significant portions of the day could generate additional revenue and provide community benefits through V2G participation.

The CHAdeMO limitation is worth noting. As the industry moves toward CCS connectors, the bidirectional capabilities that make Nissan Leafs valuable for V2G will need to be replicated in the new standard. The good news is that work is underway, with multiple automakers committing to bidirectional charging in future models. But for now, those older Leafs—often dismissed as outdated compared to newer EVs with longer range—offer a capability that most modern EVs can’t match.

California’s regulatory leadership continues to be crucial. The state’s willingness to develop new tariff structures, operating agreements, and compensation mechanisms for V2G participants creates a model that other jurisdictions can follow. PG&E’s Community Microgrid Enablement Program, informed by projects like this one, could standardize the process for integrating V2G into utility operations.

For the EV industry, the message is clear: vehicles are becoming more than just transportation. They’re mobile energy storage units that can provide grid services, backup power, and revenue opportunities. This adds another dimension to the total cost of ownership calculations that potential EV buyers consider. A vehicle that can reduce your electricity bills, power your home during outages, and earn money when parked offers value beyond its driving capabilities.

We’ll be watching closely as ChargeScape and similar platforms work to scale this technology beyond pilot projects. The Redwood Coast Airport demonstration proves the technology works; now the challenge is making it accessible to millions of EV owners rather than just specialized fleet applications. If successful, V2G could become one of those infrastructure innovations that seems obvious in retrospect—of course our parked vehicles should be helping to stabilize the grid and integrate renewable energy. The only question is how quickly we can make that vision a reality.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_0102.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:29.725986

Good Sunday afternoon. Garrett Ross here. With the Commanders drawing the early time slot today in the latest installment of the NFL’s expanded international slate, it does make me wonder whether there’s something to be said for knowing your team’s result one way or another by lunchtime, so that you can get on with your day. Let me know your thoughts.

DRIVING THE DAY

ON MESSAGE: If you’re trying to deliver a message directly to President Donald Trump, the best arena might just be an interview on Fox News.

So one might imagine, as one of the biggest intraparty blowups among Republicans unravels, that the subject of Trump’s ire would appear on the airwaves of Fox News.

But Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene — once among the president’s staunchest defenders in Congress and now a subject of Trump’s scorn following her push to release the files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — was on her own messaging mission this morning. Though her comments centered on the president, he didn’t appear to be her primary audience: Greene gave her first TV interview since the public spat with Trump to Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” — perhaps an unintentionally well-named venue for the swirling saga that is set to dominate headlines for at least a few more days.

So what was the reason for the split? “Unfortunately, it has all come down to the Epstein files, and that is shocking,” Greene told Bash, underscoring her belief that the country “deserves transparency” with regard to the files and vowing to continue pushing for their full release.

Greene said she still supports Trump and the majority of his agenda — but cracks continue to emerge, with the Georgia Republican maintaining that Trump should focus on cost-of-living issues more and cut back on foreign affairs. And she acknowledged that Trump’s comments this week have been “hurtful.”

“The most hurtful thing he said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a ‘traitor.’ And that is so extremely wrong. And those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” Greene said.

Pressed by Bash, she acknowledged it was “fair criticism” to say that she has stayed silent on other occasions when Trump has attacked political opponents.

“I am committed, and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” Greene said, noting that she’s wanted to move away from “toxic politics” since the killing of Charlie Kirk. “I’m leading the way with my own example. And I hope that President Trump can do the same.”

While Greene may be undergoing some changes, others in her party are following familiar patterns. One person who did make an appearance over on “Fox News Sunday” this morning was Speaker Mike Johnson. With the House set to vote on the release of the Epstein files on Tuesday, Johnson waved off the idea that Trump is sweating it.

“He’s not worried about it. I talk to him all the time. He has nothing to do with this,” Johnson said. “He’s frustrated that they are turning him into a political issue, and it’s not surprising because the Democrats have nothing else to talk about.”

But it’s not just Democrats talking about the Epstein files.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who teamed up with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to deliver the discharge petition that forced the House vote this week, was on ABC’s “This Week” to tout his efforts.

“Dogs don’t bark at parked cars, and we are winning,” Massie said.

“I am not tired of winning yet,” he said, likely a cheeky nod to a Trumpian phrase, “but we are winning. And not only the speaker, but the attorney general, the FBI director and the president himself and the vice president, they are taking a big loss this week because after months of fighting I am winning this week with Ro Khanna. We are forcing this vote and it will happen.”

As for the vote itself, he predicted a “deluge” of Republicans will join in voting for the release of the files — but his aim is much higher.

“I hope we get a veto-proof majority on this legislation,” Massie said, noting that the path forward in the Senate is far from clear.

“I just hope John Thune will do the right thing,” Massie said of the Senate majority leader. “But the pressure is going to be there if we get a big vote in the House.”

And he’s got a message for his colleagues who are still deciding how they’ll vote come Tuesday.

“Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement. But in 2030, he’s not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles if you don’t vote to release these files,” he warned. “And the president can’t protect you then. This vote — the record of this vote — will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency.”

SUNDAY BEST …

— Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on the coming HHS advisory vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants, on CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “I’m very concerned about this. … The vaccine is safe … and these ingredients they’re speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don’t understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we’ve been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I’m a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. … I want to make America healthy, and you don’t start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.”

— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on U.S.-China trade talks, on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures”: “We haven’t even finished the agreement, which we hope to have done by Thanksgiving, and I am confident that post-our meeting in Korea between the two leaders — President Trump, President Xi [Jinping] — that China will honor their agreements.”

— National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on the cost of coffee, bananas, beef and other goods after tariffs are removed, on ABC’s “This Week”: “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs, so —” Jonathan Karl: “So they might not come down.” Hassett: “And so the prices will go down, of course.” Karl: “Because the tariffs have been taken off, right?” Hassett: “Right, well because the supply of goods into the U.S. is going to increase.”

— Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave his quiet blessing for Kaine to vote to end the shutdown, on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “Absolutely not. … He would have preferred that I not voted the way that I did. But he knows that U.S. senators are going to do what’s in the interest of their constituents. And my 320,000 federal workers and their families are a powerful, powerful part of who I represent. And when I could get important protections for them after a year of being kicked around by Donald Trump, I said, ‘I’m ready to sign on.’ … Some folks like [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] may think that’s nothing. Virginians think it’s an awful lot.”

— Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on GOP changes to Obamacare, on “Fox News Sunday”: “We’re not going to repeal Obamacare. We’re going to fix Obamacare … You do have to protect pre-existing conditions, you have to make sure that it’s a fair system to everybody. So this is all doable. There’s no reason health care costs what it costs. We should not give money directly to the insurance companies.”

“Shocked by Trump’s profiteering? Here’s some perspective,” by Zachary Karabell in WaPo

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. THE CRACKDOWN: The federal immigration crackdown has arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina. In Trump’s latest urban target — which has seen huge recent population growth from Latin American immigrants — masked Border Patrol agents commenced operations yesterday and into today, arresting people in sometimes violent encounters and triggering protests, as the Charlotte Observer reports. In one high-profile incident, agents smashed through the window of a U.S. citizen’s truck. Immigrant advocates condemned the dozens of arrests already, while Border Patrol leader Gregory Bovino celebrated “a record day today!!!!!”

The fallout unfolded similarly to the previous crackdowns in LA and Chicago: Businesses closed and streets emptied out in areas with large immigrant populations. Democratic and Republican elected officials feuded over the crackdown. It’s not clear how long Border Patrol’s operations in the city, dubbed “Charlotte’s Web,” will last. Republicans have targeted crime in Charlotte since the random killing of a woman on a train in August.

Up next: After Charlotte, Border Patrol plans to take on New Orleans as its next target, as CBS’ Camilo Montoya-Galvez scooped. That operation will be called “Catahoula Crunch.”

Standing down: Some 400 federalized National Guard troops who were sent to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago from out of state are heading back home, after court fights prevented them from ever deploying on the streets, ABC’s Luis Martinez reports. Though the troops from California and Texas are leaving, 200 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in Chicago, as will half of the 200 Oregon National Guard troops in Portland.

2. BIG INVESTIGATION: “The Department of Deportation,” by NYT’s Nicholas Nehamas and colleagues: “The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from President Trump … A national security probe into the black market for Iranian oil sold to finance terrorism has been slowed down for months because of the shift to immigration work, allowing tanker ships and money to disappear. And federal efforts to combat human smuggling and sex trafficking have languished …

“Homeland security investigators worked approximately 33 percent fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February through April compared to their average in prior years … Administration officials defended Mr. Trump’s approach, saying the immigration crackdown was paramount to protecting public safety and national security. They also disputed that the intensified focus on immigration had undermined D.H.S.’s work. … Roughly 8 percent of those arrested had been convicted of a violent crime.”

3. THE SUBSIDIES: If Congress ends up extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies but makes policy changes to secure Republican votes, the 20 state Obamacare exchanges would have to race to update their systems accordingly, POLITICO’s Robert King reports. Implementing a clean extension would be pretty feasible, but big changes could take the state exchanges a lot of time to update premiums and communicate to consumers.

The politics: As Democrats increasingly focus on health care ahead of the midterms, some believe they can win over voters by decrying HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccine views and actions, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. And they’ll seek to win over a public facing the largest contraction of the social safety net in decades. Even as SNAP comes back online following the government shutdown, Republicans’ cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are expected to force millions of people off food stamps in the next few months, along with Medicaid cuts and other changes, POLITICO’s Marcia Brown notes.

Annals of influence: Health insurance companies faced off with Trump to try to secure the subsidy extensions. Pharmaceutical companies tried to win him over and strike deals to forestall tariffs. The divergent outcomes — with pharma so far coming out ahead — were “a case study for lobbyists trying to figure out how to handle the mercurial president and his populist approach to politics,” POLITICO’s Amanda Chu reports. “Currying favor helps, fighting is risky business.”

4. SURVEY SAYS: Americans agree that Republicans won the government shutdown, saying by a margin of 55 percent to 6 percent that the GOP got more of what they wanted, according to a new CBS poll. Relatedly, Republicans are largely satisfied with their leaders’ level of compromise, while a majority of Democrats think their party gave in too much. But the standoff did raise the salience of health care: Nearly two-thirds of the country expects that health insurance premiums are going up in the months to come.

5. STAT OF THE DAY: “Trump buys at least $82 million in bonds since late August, disclosures show,” by Reuters’ Nandita Bose: “According to the forms released by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Trump carried out more than 175 financial purchases … Most of the assets listed in Saturday’s disclosures consist of bonds issued by municipalities, states, counties, school districts and other entities with ties to public agencies. Trump’s new bond investments span several industries, including sectors that have already benefited, or are benefiting, from his administration’s policy changes … The administration has said before that … neither he nor his family has a role in running the portfolio.”

6. PARDON ME: Ed Martin announced that Trump has pardoned two more people for crimes that arose from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, per NYT’s Alan Feuer. One, Daniel Wilson, had been convicted for having illegal weapons and ammunition discovered as part of an investigation into his separate Jan. 6 crimes. The other, Suzanne Kaye, was sentenced for threatening FBI agents with violence. The pardons “were part of Mr. Trump’s continuing efforts to rewrite the history of Jan. 6,” the Times writes.

7. MAKING A LIST: “Trump recasts foreign terror list to focus on ‘antifa,’ cartels,” by WaPo’s Adam Taylor: “The Trump administration is pursuing an unprecedented expansion of the U.S. government’s list of foreign terrorist organizations, adding left-wing groups in Europe along with Latin American drug-trafficking organizations … [E]xperts said the targeting of groups linked to antifa … was a highly unusual move, particularly as those targeted this week do not directly threaten the United States or have a record of committing deadly attacks.”

8. MYSTERY SOLVED? Newly released financial disclosures show that Adriana Kugler’s surprise departure from the Fed in August came as she was being investigated for breaking ethics rules, per Bloomberg. Kugler had traded individual stocks, against Fed rules. The central bank’s IG is still investigating. Kugler had asked for a waiver and been denied by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the documents reveal. She declined to comment.

9. AN UNORTHODOX CANDIDATE: “Bravo star Dr. Heavenly Kimes wins reality TV fights. Can she win a run for Congress?” by USA Today’s Jay Stahl: “Cosmetic dentist Dr. Heavenly Kimes has been throwing shade with a smile for over a decade on Bravo’s ‘Married to Medicine’ … Now, Kimes, 54, is running in a crowded Democratic primary as she seeks to unseat Rep. David Scott, the 80-year-old incumbent in Georgia’s 13th congressional district … Kimes was demoted from main cast member and has less airtime this season – a move some believe Bravo made due to her congressional hopes – but she was allowed to film while running for office.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

Nicolás Maduro sang “Imagine” at a rally against Donald Trump’s pressure campaign.

Tina Brown thinks it’s “wonderful” that NYC’s plutocrats are “terrified” by Zohran Mamdani: “We have been so bullied by the super-rich.”

John Fetterman is back home after 20 stitches and some gnarly facial injuries.

Brian Glenn posted love and support for his girlfriend, Marjorie Taylor Greene, as Trump feuds with her. George Conway responded: “Seriously, it must be nice to have someone you care for stick up for you when you stand up to Trump.”

OUT AND ABOUT — At the ModSquad retreat yesterday in Charlottesville, Virginia, Rahm Emanuel was the keynote speaker, weighing in on the government shutdown. Senate Minority Leader “Chuck Schumer is not the problem, Donald Trump is and the Republicans,” Emanuel said. “They don’t come out of this really well … Do not underestimate what it meant for a president of the United States, who’s already got some preconceived negatives, to be going to the Supreme Court to deny people food, to be so cruel that he was willing to fire people because he wanted to hurt them, shut down bridges. … The contrast of that picture is cutting the food stamps and doing a ‘Great Gatsby’ party.”

Samson Signori, campaign manager for Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, also spoke at the retreat about lessons for Democrats from their victory. Signori said the campaign was laser-focused on costs and safety — and the effects of Trump’s policies, like DOGE’s civil service cuts, rather than the man himself. “It was only invoking Trump when it was having a direct impact on Trump’s economy,” Signori said.

— SPOTTED at the Belgian Embassy’s King’s Day reception Friday night: Belgian Ambassador Frédéric Bernard, USTR Jamieson Greer, Italian Ambassador Marco Peronaci, Liechtenstein Ambassador Georg Sparber, Egyptian Ambassador Motaz Zahran, Burundian Ambassador Jean Bosco Barege, Congolese Ambassador Yvette Kapinga Ngandu, Spanish Ambassador Ángeles Moreno Bau, Michael Gordon, Vera Bergengruen, Sam Skove, Olivia Gazis and Eric Martin.

— More than 1,000 Iranian-Americans gathered at the Hyatt Regency yesterday for the National Council of Resistance of Iran’s “Free Iran” convention, where speakers included Mike Pompeo, Carla Sands, Patrick Kennedy, John Bercow and Guy Benson. Pompeo called for the Abraham Accords to keep growing and said Iran’s government “is weak and more isolated than ever. Fear is its only tool.”

— The National Portrait Gallery held its Portrait of a Nation awards and fundraiser gala last night at Union Station, with honors going to Jamie Dimon, Temple Grandin, Joy Harjo and Steven Spielberg. Presenters included Jeff Bezos, Claire Danes, Emily Gerson Saines, Sandra Cisneros and Amy Sherald. The four honorees will have their portraits hanging at the gallery for roughly the next year.

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin says the move aims to ensure public safety. Local officials including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles are criticizing the arrests, saying they cause unnecessary fear.

Observers say they have seen an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine is working on a prisoner exchange with Russia

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia, potentially bringing home 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced this on Sunday, following progress in negotiations. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Secretary, said Saturday that talks mediated by Turkey and the UAE focused on activating agreements brokered in Istanbul. These agreements set rules for large swaps. Meanwhile, Russian drone strikes damaged energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region overnight into Sunday. Ukraine’s air force reported shooting down 139 drones. Ukrainian forces also struck a major oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region.

Trump says stopping suspected drug boats doesn't work. But the US reports record cocaine seizures

MIAMI (AP) — President Donald Trump has justified American military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs by saying the longtime U.S. strategy of interdicting such vessels has been a major failure. Trump’s comments came around the same time that the U.S. Coast Guard announced a record year for cocaine seizures. That milestone, however, hasn't stopped the Republican president from upending decades of U.S. counternarcotics policy with a series of military strikes in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Veterans of the drug war say U.S. resources would be better spent doubling down on the traditional approach of interdicting drug boats.

Trump, like Biden before him, finds there's no quick fix on inflation

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s problems with fixing the high cost of living might be giving voters a feeling of déjà vu. Just like President Joe Biden, Trump says lower prices are just around the corner. But Biden-era officials say that argument doesn't work with impatient voters. Republicans pushed the case that Biden’s policies made inflation worse. Democrats are using that same framing today. They say Trump's tariffs are getting passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and that mass deportations have made the construction of homes more expensive. Trump says Republicans need to do a better job explaining his policies. But he also blames Biden for the economic problems.

Voters in Virginia and New Jersey send a message: It's Trump's economy now

FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — The economy and rising prices were high on the minds of voters on Election Day, and those concerns contributed to a Democratic sweep of statewide offices in Virginia and New Jersey. The voting pattern in two traditionally Republican counties in each state is evidence of how strongly Democrats campaigned on pocketbook issues. Spotsylvania County in Virginia and Morris County in New Jersey backed Donald Trump and Republican candidates for governor in earlier elections. This month, voters in those counties went with Democrats up and down the ballot. With congressional midterm elections in 2026, the November results have sent a message to conservatives who hold power in Washington.

First strong winter rains soak Gaza's makeshift shelters

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Parts of Gaza's huge Muwasi tent camp are struggling after winter's first major rainfall. Residents faced flooding and damaged infrastructure on Saturday after two years of war. They tried to dig trenches to keep water out of their tents while rain soaked their belongings. Strong winds can also topple tents and make it hard to gather food and supplies. The United Nations earlier this year said Muwasi was sheltering up to 425,000 displaced Palestinians. The Israeli defense body says it is allowing in winterization materials, but aid organizations warn these efforts are insufficient. Some people tried to shelter in destroyed buildings at risk of collapse.

The unpopular and politically weak 90-year-old Palestinian leader struggles for a role in Gaza

CAIRO (AP) — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas turns 90 on Saturday, still holding power in parts of the West Bank but weakened and unpopular. Critics say his long tenure without elections has left Palestinians leaderless during an existential crisis. Hopes for a Palestinian state, central to Abbas' agenda, seem dimmer than ever. Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza is seen by many as genocide, a claim Israel denies. Abbas' Palestinian Authority is sidelined in Gaza, and critics fear Palestinians will have little voice in their future. An October poll found 80% of Palestinians want Abbas to resign.

Trump pardons Jan. 6 rioter for gun offense and woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has issued two pardons related to the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, including for a woman convicted of threatening to shoot FBI agents who were investigating a tip that she may have been at the Capitol. In a separate case, Trump issued a second pardon for a Jan. 6 defendant who had remained behind bars despite the sweeping grant of clemency for Capitol rioters because of a separate conviction for illegally possessing firearms. It’s the latest example of Trump’s willingness to use his constitutional authority to help supporters who were scrutinized as part of the Biden administration’s massive Jan. 6 investigation that led to charges against more than 1,500 defendants.

Ho remembered her as a funny person and humorous writer who wanted people with disabilities to have independence and a voice for themselves.

Homeland Security agents surge into North Carolina's largest city. Here's what to know

U.S. immigration agents are targeting North Carolina’s largest city over objections from local leaders, prompting activists, elected officials and community groups to monitor any sweeps and support vulnerable Charlotte residents. President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in Charlotte had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations. It’s the latest step in the Trump administration’s strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of some of America’s largest cities run by Democrats. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who don’t have legal status in the U.S., and sparked a number of lawsuits.",https://baytobaynews.com/images/favicons/favicon-v2.ico,N,,2025-11-16 17:59:38.069308

Google data centers totaling $40 billion coming to Texas, Texas Tribune

As I wrote about this week, ERCOT hired Aurora Energy Research to run models of strategies to reduce the likelihood of rolling outages in a 2023-like heat wave or 2022-like winter storm.

There was one scenario that had zero rolling outages: high demand growth from data centers with high levels of flexibility.

The same week the report came out, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Governor Abbott appeared on a stage together to announce $40 billion in investment including 6.2 gigawatts of incremental supply and a fund for energy efficiency, which was highlighted in Governor Abbott’s statement:

“Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy,” Abbott wrote in a statement. “Google’s $40 billion investment makes Texas Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state. We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen.”

When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts | The Wall Street Journal (gift link)

Texas will clearly be a major destination for data centers. The WSJ had a great piece breaking down the realities of supply constraints facing AI developers:

The rate at which tech companies and startups are investing in AI shows no signs of slowing. In their latest financial reports, all of the big spenders revealed that their current investments had grown significantly, and projected that this trend would continue.

There is effectively “infinite” money available right now to build out new data centers, says Jim Schneider, a senior research analyst at Goldman Sachs. All this investment has translated into record spending on the stuff that goes into data centers—aka “AI supercomputers”—all those chips, servers, HVAC systems, transformers, gas turbines, power lines and power plants.

Today’s record number of data centers at the planning stage is indicative of what Raymond James managing director Frank Louthan calls “kind of a gold rush mentality.” Connecting these planned data centers to power and fiber, and finding a buyer or tenant who wants one, in that particular location is another matter.

As the chart shows below there’s about 70 gigawatts of planned power capacity in 2025 alone. Next year will almost certainly be even bigger.

The high load growth scenario modeled by Aurora was for 22 gigawatts in Texas over the next five years.

The rebates are income-based. Households making below 80% of their county’s area median income are eligible to receive the full amount, while those making between 80% and 150% could see up to half.

The rebates are expected to be available through 2029, or until funds run out. These benefits are different from the federal clean energy tax credits that were also passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, some of which have already been phased out . Credits for electric vehicles ended in September, while credits for home appliances and solar installation expire on Dec. 31.

For the rebate program, homeowners must work with a registered contractor to receive the benefit. More than 55 contractors across Colorado have already begun the registration process, and the state will continue to add to the list of approved contractors over the coming weeks as more contractors complete the process.

Registered contractors will subtract the approved rebate amount from the upfront cost of the installation or upgrade.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2025/11/14141957/Clean-Energy-Home-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 13:59:58.510973

Just days after announcing plans for a third Oklahoma data center, Google confirmed another major investment in renewable energy infrastructure—this time in Arkansas.

Arkansas Business reports the company will be the exclusive buyer of power from the $123 million Redfield Solar Farm in Grant County, located in southeast Arkansas.

The facility, owned and operated by Treaty Oak Clean Energy of Austin, Texas, spans more than 1,000 acres of solar panels and is designed to generate 100 megawatts (MW) of power—enough to supply nearly 18,000 homes.

Operations Expected to Begin in Mid-2026

Power Distributed Through Entergy Arkansas

Construction of the Redfield Solar project began earlier this year, with operations expected to start in the second quarter of 2026.

Power from the site will be transmitted through Entergy Arkansas, serving the grid operator’s 15-state region, which includes Oklahoma. Reports suggest a portion of the power may be used to operate Google’s data centers in Oklahoma, supporting the company’s expanding AI and cloud computing footprint.

A new report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that natural gas prices for utilities will rise by 37% by the end of 2025, driven by surging wholesale market costs.

While consumers are expected to feel the impact, the cost increase for end users will be significantly lower than what utilities themselves will pay.

Wholesale Prices Driving Broad Sector Increases

Electric and Industrial Sectors See Largest Jumps

The EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts that the average price of natural gas paid by electric power plants will climb 37%, while prices paid by industrial customers will rise 21% compared with 2024 levels.

Smaller increases are expected for commercial and residential customers, both projected at 4% year-over-year.

Each sector’s price is partially influenced by the Henry Hub benchmark, the industry’s key indicator of natural gas spot prices. The report noted that Henry Hub prices have been higher each month compared with the same months in 2024. On an annual basis, the EIA expects the 2025 Henry Hub price to be 58% higher than in 2024.

Industrial and Power Producers Feel the Impact First

Wholesale Price Volatility Hits Major Buyers

The wholesale price of natural gas most directly affects industrial users and power generators, whose retail prices closely mirror shifts in the Henry Hub spot price.

These large-scale consumers often buy gas on a wholesale basis, covering both commodity and transmission costs. As a result, the rise in wholesale market prices will quickly translate into higher costs for utilities and industrial plants.

Retail Prices for Smaller Consumers Rise More Slowly

Regulation and Billing Cycles Moderate Increases

For residential, commercial, and small industrial customers, natural gas prices do not track wholesale spikes as closely, because utilities typically adjust rates gradually through billing cycles.

These adjustments often occur under state regulatory oversight, which can limit rapid price increases and smooth out volatility.

EIA noted that customer charges and fixed distribution fees also dilute the direct impact of wholesale fluctuations on household and small-business bills.

It seems like a day doesn’t go by without Waymo making some kind of expansion announcement. Detroit, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the cities the company plans to bring its robotaxi to in the coming months. But as I have argued in this newsletter before, there is another “expansion” I think is more important.

Freeways.

And now after years of testing and development, the company’s commercial robotaxi service is using freeways around the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.

This is a critical expansion for the company. It’s the concrete and asphalt connective tissue in sprawling metro areas like the Bay Area. This new freeway access is fueling Waymo’s expansion in that region, which is now 260 square miles and encompasses Silicon Valley and San Francisco.

Robotaxi rides can have more efficient routes too. Waymo told me it will reduce ride times by up to 50%.

And using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in.

That freeway-to-airport moment will be the big unlock for Waymo. But will it be enough to help push it in the black? Until someone over there slides me their balance sheet, I can’t say. It will certainly be a popular option for travelers. That doesn’t mean the economics will pencil out.

A little bird

It’s been nearly nine months since Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson abruptly resigned, leaving the company without a permanent replacement. That may be about to change, though.

A few little birds told us Lucid Motors has zeroed in on a candidate for the top role. It’s expected to be someone outside the organization, which is perhaps no surprise; in August, we shared here that the company and the executive hiring firm it’s using had cast a very wide net and was even cold-calling some candidates. This would likely mean that Marc Winterhoff, who’s been serving as interim CEO, would slide back to the COO role he occupied before Rawlinson left.

Deals!

Another SPAC has entered the AV world! Mergers with special acquisition companies may not be officially “back,” but they are certainly popular among autonomous vehicle companies.

Einride, the Swedish electric and autonomous truck startup, plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, just six weeks after it raised $100 million from investors. The SPAC merger with Legato Merger Corp. values Einride at $1.8 billion in pre-money equity.

Einride does generate revenue, which may sound obvious but there have been plenty of pre-revenue transportation companies that have SPAC’d in recent years.

For now, its primary source of revenue is coming from its software-as-a-service product and a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks used by companies like Heineken and PepsiCo. Its unusual-looking autonomous podlike trucks are still in pilot mode.

The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, with Einride making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

Forterra, a company developing autonomous tech for defense, raised $238 million in equity and debt funding. Moore Strategic Ventures led the equity piece of the funding, while Crescent Cove provided the debt financing.

Gopuff, the rapid-delivery startup, raised $250 million in a round led by Eldridge Industries and Valor Equity Partners. Baillie Gifford, Robinhood, Equalis Capital, George Ruan, Yakir Gabay, and Gopuff’s co-founders. The funding put its valuation at $8.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, a significant markdown from its last raise in 2021.

Harbinger, the Los Angeles-based electric truck startup, raised $160 million in a Series C funding round co-led by FedEx. As part of the investment, FedEx ordered 53 of Harbinger’s electric truck chassis.

Octopus Electric Vehicles, a U.K.-based electric vehicle-leasing business, has struck a deal with lenders, including Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Agricole, to take its total funding line to £2 billion ($2.6 billion), Sky News reported.

Teradar, a Boston-based startup developing a solid-state sensor, raised $150 million in a Series B funding round from investors Capricorn Investment Group, Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, mobility-focused firm Ibex Investors, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.

Upway, an e-bike refurbishment startup, raised $60 million in a Series C funding round led by A.P. Moller. Galvanize, Ora Global, and Sequoia Capital also participated. The company has raised more than $125 million since its founding in 2021.

Vay, a German startup that remotely pilots rental cars to customers, announced a $60 million investment from Singaporean tech heavyweight Grab. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year, may be followed by “an additional $350M as joint milestones are achieved within the first year.”

The ride-hailing company is also seeking more premium customers through new efforts like Uber Ski, which lets riders schedule a vehicle in advance to nearly 40 popular ski destinations in North America and Europe, including Vail in Colorado and Park City in Utah.

Via had its first earnings since it became a publicly traded company, and, welp, it lost money. The tech transit software company reported a loss of $36.9 million in its third quarter, a 73% increase since the same period last year. Its revenue grew to $713 million, an 11% increase YoY.

One more thing …

Remember the poll in last week’s newsletter? I asked which product goal is Tesla most likely to achieve by 2035? The options are based on real goals laid out in Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package:

20 million Tesla vehicles delivered

10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions

1 million robots delivered

1 million robotaxis in commercial operation

None of these will be reached

And y’all are split between two options: Tesla delivering 20 million vehicles, which received 34.7% of the vote, and “None of these will be reached,” which received 32% of the vote.

The one item you seem to agree on is that Tesla is unlikely to deliver on the other three goals. About 9.5% of readers picked the 1 million robots option, 12.6% chose 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 10.5% picked 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation within 10 years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SF_WAYMO-FREEWAY_FRONT.jpg?resize=1200,801",N,,2025-11-16 13:59:52.312774

UK Gov’t Taps Rolls-Royce for Three 480 MW PWRs at Wylfa

North Wales site chosen ahead of Oldbury in England for three Rolls-Royce reactors

(NucNet contributed to this report ) The UK has chosen the island of Anglesey off the Welsh coast to host Britain’s first small modular reactors, designed by Rolls-Royce. Each PWR type unit can produce 480 MWe of power for a total of 1,440 MW or nearly the equivalent of one of the 1,650 MW EPRs being built by EDF at the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C sites.

Roll-Royce said that most of the reactor’s components will be built in “factory production” environments. According to the firm, they will be assembled into the completed reactor on-site. The effects of these plans will be to significantly reduce project risk and shorten build schedules. The Rolls-Royce SMR is expected to have a 60 year service life.

The Wylfa decision marks a major step forward for Britain’s nascent SMR industry, which the government hopes can help replace the UK’s fleet of large, ageing nuclear power plants. Nuclear currently supplies about 14% of the UK’s electricity.

In a statement the government said North Wales will become a beacon in the “golden age” of nuclear, delivering the UK’s first three SMRs at the Wylfa nuclear site in the north of the island, choosing it ahead of a rival site at Oldbury in Gloucestershire, southwest England.

The island of Anglesey is located about 90 miles west of Liverpool, U.K.

The government also announced that Great British Energy-Nuclear (GBE-N), the body overseeing new nuclear in the UK, has been tasked with identifying suitable sites that could potentially host new large-scale reactors.

GBE-N will report back by autumn 2026 on potential sites. The energy secretary, Ed Milliband, has requested this includes sites across the UK including Scotland, where the devolved Scottish National Party government is opposed to nuclear.

Any large-scale project would be similar in scale to the Hinkley Point C or Sizewell C projects, with the potential to power the equivalent of six million homes. This implies a requirement for 3.7 GWe of 24×7/365 electrical generation capacity.

The Wylfa decision marks a major step forward for Britain’s nascent SMR industry, which the government hopes can help replace the UK’s fleet of large, ageing nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy currently supplies about 14% of the UK’s electricity.

Decision ‘Rights The Wrongs’ Of Previous Failures

The government said the confirmation of Wylfa as the host site rights the wrongs of previous failure to bring new nuclear power to North Wales.

In March 2024, GBE-N bought the Wylfa and Oldbury sites from Hitachi Ltd for £160 million ($201 million). Both sites house shut-down Magnox nuclear plants and had been intended for deployment of large Hitachi advanced boiling water (BWR)reactor technology by the then Hitachi-subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power.

However, the Horizon Wylfa project was abandoned by Hitachi in early 2019 due to cost pressures and because of corporate concerns about the financial terms offered by the U.K. government. Hitachi wrote off £2.1 billion in the process. Plans for Oldbury were dropped in 2020.

The Wylfa and Oldbury projects were each expected to host twin Hitachi 1,350 MW ABWRs for a total of 5.4 GW of electrical generation capacity or 145% of the combined power expected to be generated by the two EDF reactors now under construction. The cancellation of theses projects revealed fundamental weaknesses in the ability of the UK government to address the nation’s energy security needs.

In March 2024, the government announced that an agreement had been reached to buy the Hitachi-owned sites for new nuclear at Wylfa and at Oldbury-on-Severn in southwest England. At the time, the government said said the two sites were expected to be selected for new nuclear energy projects.

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said, “Bringing nuclear back to Wylfa is a historic moment for Wales and for the UK’s clean energy future. Wylfa’s revival offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver clean, reliable power for decades to come, create thousands of skilled jobs, attract major investment, and revitalize North Wales’s proud industrial heritage.”

Potential for Further Domestic New Builds and Exports

The U.K. government also said in its press statement there is “strong export potential” for small modular reactors, after the UK and Czechia signed a deal to cooperate on civil nuclear. It comes after Rolls-Royce SMR and Czechia’s largest public company, CEZ, agreed last year to partner on SMRs, with CEZ acquiring a 20% stake. Rolls-Royce has said it has proposed building six of its SMRs in that country.

Great British Energy-Nuclear also owns the Oldbury nuclear site near Gloucester. As a site which has previously hosted a nuclear power station, it also has great potential for new nuclear, including the potential to support the privately-led projects being developed by the nuclear industry. Earlier this year the government announced a shake-up of planning rules to allow new nuclear projects including SMRs to be built in a range of sites across England and Wales including Wlyfa and Oldbury.

The Oldbury Nuclear Site, home to two of the UK’s oldest nuclear reactors that were commissoined in 1967, is 131 miles due west of London. The 217 MW Magnox reactors are now shut down and in the hands of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.

Separately, the government said it was planning to develop additional large nuclear power stations like Sizewell and Hinkley Point. The government plans to report on potential sites for gigawatt-scale reactors through Great British Energy in the near future.

Sites under consideration right now include Torness east of Edinburgh and Hunterston west of Glasgow. Westinghouse could position itself as a candidate for these future projects offering its 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR, particularly given the diplomatic pressure from the U.S. (See next story)

Funding Plans and Investors

Rolls-Royce’s SMR deal is subject to final government approvals and contract signature, expected later this year. The government has pledged £2.5 billion of funding for SMRs for the startup phase of the project o help Rolls-Royce develop three 480-MW reactors.

At $9,000/kw, each 480 MW unit would cost $4.3 billion and all three would cost $12.9 billion. The actual costs are still unknown as it will be several years before any of the units pours first concrete.

This is about 20% of the total expected cost of the three SMRs. The 80% of the cost will have to be funded by private investors. Also, Rolls-Royce may able to convince the government to authorize it to use the Regulated Asset Base method (RAB).

Under the RAB model, consumers contribute to the cost of new nuclear power projects during the construction phase – but overall the UK government estimatesconsumers are expected to save more than £30 billion over the project’s lifetime on each new large-scale nuclear power station compared with existing funding mechanisms.

Initial contributions will give private investors greater certainty through a lower and more reliable rate of return in the early stages of a project, lowering the cost of financing it, and ultimately helping reduce consumer electricity bills.

The New York Times, in its reports about the Rolls Royce decision, noted that the firm has secured investments from the Qatar Investment Authority, the Persian Gulf emirate’s sovereign wealth fund; Constellation, an American utility; and a 20% equity stakje by CEZ, the Czech Republic’s power company.

The RAB model will reduce the UK’s reliance on overseas developers for financing new nuclear projects by substantially increasing the pool of private investors to include British pension funds, insurers and other domestic institutional investors. The UK bought out China’s investment in the Sizewell C reactor project due to “security concerns.”

If the firm completes the licensing process for the SMR in 2026, as currently scheduled. first concrete could be poured as early as 2027. With a four year constuction timeline, the first unit could be in revenue service, providing returns to investors, by 2031.

Licensing the Rolls-Royce SMR in the UK

In 2022 Rolls-Royce began the U.K.’s licensing process, known as the generic design assessment, which is a three step process carried out by the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR). The firm completed Step 2 of the GDA assessment in July 2024 using the 2019 reactor design data.

Successful completion of the GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and acceptance of an environmental review. Step 3 is expected to be completed in August 2026 for a total duration of 53 months.

The costly and complex process can take three-to-five years to complete depending on how well the applicant is prepared to meet the highly prescriptive requirement of the process. This timeline means that the earliest Roll-Royce could break ground would be the 2028/2029 timeframe. It is unknown what the cost of the reactors are likely to be by then. Rolls-Royce told the BBC it plans to have the first unit in revenue service by the early 2030s. These dates suggest a four-year construction timeline.

Washington Expresses Disappointment Over Selection of Rolls-Royce

The decision to choose Rolls-Royce over its U.S. competitor Westinghouse Electric Company has drawn unusual and sharp criticism from Washington. Warren Stephens, the US Ambassador to the UK, published a statement ahead of the UK announcement expressing his disappointment with the news. The text of the complaint goes far beyond the expected boundaries of diplomatic notes between allies.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location.”

The ambassador’s unprecedented remarks suggested that Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales. What he is focused on its the full size AP1000 at 1,150 MW and not SMRs.

Stephens said: “If you want to get shovels in the ground as soon as possible and take a big step in addressing energy prices and availability, there is a different path, and we look forward to decisions soon on large-scale nuclear projects.”

“As I have repeatedly said, we want the UK to be the strongest possible ally to the United States, and high energy costs are an impediment to that,” Stephens added.

His statement gave no details of alternatives proposed by the US but it given that the Westinghouse offering is the only large reactor, that has been built elsewhere (China and U.S) that could be provided.

The UK announcement awarding the contract to Rolls-Royce appears to have caught Washington off guard, particularly given the nuclear pact the two countries made during Trump’s state visit earlier in the autumn.

The deal focused on cutting red tape in the licensing of both SMRs and full size reactors. Interestingly, that agreement cited X-Energy which is a a U.S. developer of an advanced SMR based on an 80 MW HTGR SMR design that will use TRISO HALEU enriched nuclear fuel.

A U.K. government spokesperson defended the decision to award the contract to Rolls-Royce as the right one for the UK.

“This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR program, producing homegrown clean power with a British company and we have chosen the best site for it,” the source told The Guardian. More to the point, the selection of Rolls-Royce preserves the firm’s capability to manufacture and maintain the Royal Navy’s fleet of nuclear powered submarines and surface ships.

It follows that the UK government selected Rolls-Royce for a combination of reasons having to do with energy security and national security. The US government cannot have been blind to these imperatives. It follows that the ambassador’s comments on UK internal affairs were directed by a White House reaction with an assist from industry lobbying.

Does the Westinghouse AP300 Have a Future in the UK?

It is clear that Ambassador Stephens was referring to the Westinghouse AP1000, an 1,150 MW PWR. However, the firm already has an early stage foothold in the UK for the AP300, its 300 MW SMR, which is a downsized version of the AP1000.

In February 2024 Westinghouse scored a win for its marketing efforts in the UK with an non-binding agreement in principle to build four 300 MW AP300 small modular reactors, for a total of 1.2 GW, in a privately funded project in an industrial region of the UK.

The firm has not publicly disclosed the names of its investors for the project but they are assumed to be industries in the region who want electrical power and are impatient with the glacial pace of government decision making in siting new reactors.

In a press statement the firm said, “Westinghouse Electric Company announced that it has signed an agreement with Community Nuclear Power, Ltd. (CNP) that puts it on track to deploy the UK’s first privately-financed small modular reactor fleet, with the Westinghouse AP300 SMR.”

The new power station will be sited at Seal Sands, a former chemical works. The plant closed on November 2021. Located on the shore of the Tees river, the proposed SMR plant site is adjacent to a Conoco Oil facility and upriver from an ecological reserve.

The North Teesside region of Northeast England, Middlesbrough, is located on England’s North Sea coast, 260 miles due north of London. Iron and steel have dominated the industry of both Middlesbrough and the Teesside area from the 1840s. Teesside had also become one of the major steel centers in the country, and one of the largest worldwide. Industrial decline in recent years has hampered economic development in the region.

Ship building and coal mining have also been major industries in the region. All of these industries would be logical customers in terms of offering robust demand for electricity and decarbonization of power intensive manufacturing processes. New, reliable power sources, which provide carbon free electricity, would be attractive incentives for new industry to move to the region.

Prospects for the AP300 in the U.S., as well as for the U.K., are uncertain due to the development timeline for it extending to 2030. Earlier this year, the project’s Chief Technology Officer, Rita Baranwal, jumped ship to sign on with Radient Nuclear, a developer of a micro reactor. The firm has a deal to deliver one of its units to the US Air Force and was recently named as one of ten micro reactor developers to participate in the Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Pilot Program.

Elsewhere, Westinghose has a non-binding MOU for the selection and deployment of Westinghouse technology for nuclear new build projects in New Brunswick for both grid power and dedicated industrial purposes. In 2023 Westinghouse began discussions with Ukraine to consider its AP300. In August 2024 Westinghouse was approved to submit its AP300 to the Generic Design Assessment process at the UK Office of Nuclear Regulation.

Italy’s Newcleo Shift Gears to Focus on the U.S.Market

It took just nanoseconds for Italian SMR developer NewCleo to read the U.K. tea leaves as the government in London announced it selected Rolls-Royce to build three of its 480 MW SMRs at Wylfa.

Newcleo said in a press statement is has now made a strategic shift with new plans to build 20 SMRs in the UK – a project valued at around $20 billion – in favor of pursuing opportunities in the US. The start-up also recently shifted its headquarters from Britain to France.

At the World Nuclear Exhibition in Paris, Newcleo CEO Stefano Buono told the Reuters wire service: “There are a lot of tools that are encouraging investment into the US now.”

A company spokesperson later told Reuters several steps remain before an investment commitment is made. In addition to reactor deployment, NewCleo is positioned as an investor in a joint venture with Oklo to build a $1.68 billion nuclear fuel production plant in Tennessee.

Other European Nuclear Reactor Developers Eye U.S. Nuclear Markets

Newcleo isn’t the only European nuclear energy firm taking aim at the U.S. market. Thorizon, a Franco-Dutch SMR manufacturer, is among other companies that are considering setting up operations in the US due to quicker pathways to market. While the firm has continued to pursue markets in European Union countries, it has not, so far, made any public announcements about prospects in the U.S.

Thorizon’s primary market is currently in Europe, but its focus on using nuclear waste and the development of a unique, cartridge-based molten salt reactor positions it for the future U.S. market, particularly the demand from large-scale industrial users and data centers.

A potential U.S. market strategy for Thorizon could involve:

Forming a strategic joint venture with a U.S. utility or industrial end-user.

Establishing a U.S. presence to begin pre-licensing engagement with the NRC.

Highlighting the circular fuel cycle advantage to U.S. policymakers and the public.

As of March 2025, the firm has raised $43 million in Series A funding. In August 2025 the European Union awarded the firm an additional €10 million ($11.6 million) from the Just Transition Fund (JTF).

The firm is developing a molten salt SMR. The Thorizon One will provide 250MW of industrial heat. It can also be transformed into 100MW electricity, enough to power 250.000 households. It has forged partnerships with Orano for fuel development, Tractebel for engineering, and VDL Groep for prototyping, while collaborating with EPZ for early operator input, and with EDF on R&D.

The firm faces stiff competition in the US from at least a dozen other developers of micro reactors. Additionally, any serious effort to enter the US market would require preparing a regulatory engagement plan with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Any other micro or small modular reactors developer from Europe seeking to enter the US markert would face similar challenges.

Enrichment Firms Expand US Capacity

Reuters reports that French company Orano and multinational Urenco are reportedly planning to set up new enrichment facilities in the US to cater to rising industry demand.

Orano is planning its first overseas enrichment plant near Oak Ridge, TN, for an expected $5 billion investment. Most of the planneed site is undeveloped. (Image right courtesty of Orano)

Depending on federal funding and customers’ support, the facility will produce LEU/LEU+ to fuel existing commercial nuclear energy reactors and, potentially, HALEU to help develop and power advanced reactors.

Orano aims to have its facility operational by 2031 and predicts that the US may soon become its largest market, overtaking its production of nuclear fuel in France.

Urenco currently operates a site in Eunice, NM, with capacity expansions under way. In October Urenco received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to enrich uranium up to up to 10% U235.

Urenco CEO Boris Schucht said: “A lot of customers, especially US customers, are once again supporting us with very long-term contracts for our own capacity program.”

The company’s plant in New Mexico is making about 4.3 million tons of uranium a year, with 700,000 tons of capacity being added incrementally to 2027. The company can add up to 2 million tons in additional capacity if needed, said Schucht.

Oklo Gets DOE Approval of Fuel Fabrication Safety Milestone

Oklo Announces U.S. Department of Energy Approval for Nuclear Safety Design Agreement of Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operations Office has approved the Nuclear Safety Design Agreement (NSDA) for the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), selected to participate in the DOE’s Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Project. The NSDA, the first under the DOE’s Fuel Line Pilot Project, was approved in just under two weeks.

Located at INL’s Materials Fuel Complex, the A3F, on the Arco desert about 25 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID, will fabricate fuel for Oklo’s first commercial-scale powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. Together, these facilities couple fuel production to power delivery for commercial deployment of advanced nuclear energy. Oklo plans to have the Aurora Powerhouse in operation by 2027.

Oklo and Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the Department of Energy’s management and operations contractor for INL, entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) in 2023 for Oklo to use a supply of DOE high- assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for fuel fabrication. This HALEU fuel feedstock is uranium metal recovered from Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) in the Fuel Conditioning Facility under a DOE-funded program.

Oklo was granted access to fuel material through a competitive DOE process launched in 2019. In 2019, the company received both a site-use permit at INL and access to fuel recovered from thec Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II).

The DOE review of the safety basis for nuclear facilities determines whether the safety basis has been developed in a manner that provides reasonable assurance of adequate protection of workers, the public, and the environment from adverse consequences, taking into account the work to be performed and the associated hazards.

“This approval marks clear progress toward demonstrating how we can repurpose used nuclear fuel to power the next generation of clean energy reactors,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo Inc.

“Advanced fuel fabrication and recycling technologies represent a significant unlock for our business, addressing fuel-supply challenges while transforming fuel economics and creating new revenue opportunities.”

“Approval of the NSDA for Oklo’s Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility is an important step forward,” said Robert Boston, Manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office. “We’re excited for companies selected for the Fuel Line Pilot Program to demonstrate how the United States can safely and efficiently scale the next generation of nuclear fuel manufacturing.”

Oklo Expands Collaboration with Idaho National Laboratory

on Advanced Fuels and Materials

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the management and operating contractor for Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to expand collaboration on scientific and technological research and development in areas such as advanced fuel and materials work that are mutually beneficial and support Oklo’s commercial deployment.

The collaboration plans to use Oklo’s first commercial power plant, Aurora-INL. While the Aurora powerhouse is designed for power production, it is also capable of generating fast neutrons and thereby generating valuable data through in-reactor irradiation experiments that can then be analyzed at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC).

This capability enables fast reactor irradiation testing in the US that hasn’t existed in decades. The data collected will support future fuel manufacturing improvements, cost reductions, and Oklo’s recycling efforts. By generating new fast reactor data under commercial operating conditions, Oklo aims to accelerate how it refines and qualifies its fuel and materials by leveraging its vertically integrated approach of product deployment.

Under the MOU, Oklo and INL will collaborate on irradiation of advanced nuclear fuels and materials during Aurora-INL’s operating life which could be examined at INL to better understand how fuel and materials perform in a fast- spectrum reactor environment. The resulting data would help advance U.S. fast reactor capabilities and nuclear fuel manufacturing.

The collaboration was prompted by ongoing work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Fuels Campaign (AFC) as well as a recent project supported under the DOE’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) which helped Oklo and INL test design and logistical strategies that can be incorporated into Oklo’s Aurora Powerhouse for irradiation and subsequent analysis.

LucidCatalyst Study Shows Significant Potential market for SMRs

LucidCatalyst presents a new study, “A new nuclear world: how small modular reactors can power industry.” The study has been published by Urenco, who commissioned LucidCatalyst to produce it to further industry understanding of this evolving market.

The report is supported by World Nuclear Association. It analyzes the energy demands of 11 industries representing 80% of industrial energy use, going beyond data centers to examine where SMRs can make a tangible impact on industrial energy delivery, and quantifies how changes in delivery models and market drivers can expand SMR market access. (Full text of report: PDF file)

The study sets out how the full potential of the SMR market in the industrial energy space can be unlocked, representing a $0.5–1.5 trillion investment opportunity, as energy-intensive sectors face mounting pressure to secure reliable, cost-competitive energy whilst meeting decarbonization commitments.

The key findings of the study include that:

SMRs could reach 700GW of capacity by 2050 (under the Transformation Scenario involving factory style mass manufacturing approaches to constructing SMRs). This sizable opportunity, representing nearly double the current global nuclear capacity, and would expand nuclear capacity beyond the projected goal to triple conventional deployment.

Simultaneous improvements across six areas of delivery would enable this outcome: a ‘product-based’ approach to manufacturing and licensing, freeing up sites for SMRs; stronger policy and financing support, and a more mature reactor developer environment.

The top five industries representing more than 75% of the 700GW opportunity are: synthetic fuels for aviation and maritime, coal repowering, data centers, and chemicals.

Other sectors such as food and beverage (43 GW), iron and steel (33 GW) and district energy (33 GW) also represent sizable opportunities, with district energy demand being more prevalent in Europe. Upstream oil and gas is a more prevalent opportunity in North America.

With improvements to current construction methods alone, 120GW of capacity could still be achieved by 2050 (under the Programmatic scenario, involving enhanced Government support and improved project management).

The study warns that stronger policy and financing support is needed to achieve economic viability.

“Policymakers can identify national SMR market opportunities, signal strategic priorities, and design targeted policies to address critical development bottlenecks,” the study says.

Figure 4 – In the 40 GW pipeline identified in this study, not all projects have the same level of confidence. Around 50% of this pipeline (20 GW) corresponds to projects that are actively progressing and show strong development signals (Figure 4).

These trends are consistent with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) “Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)” projections, 1/ which suggest around 19 GW of SMRs in advanced economies by 2050. These results are encouraging and confirm that the SMR potential to meet industrial energy needs is both substantiated and actively developing. (Image: Lucid Catalyst)

1/: IAEA – The Path to a New Era for Nuclear Energy

High-profile US projects include TerraPower’s construction of a Natrium SMR at a former coal site in Kemmerrer, WY, and plans to deploy four X-Energy 80 MW HTGRs SMRs to provide power for chemical giant Dow’s Seadrift plant in Texas. Amazon has unveiled plans for an SMR facility in the state of Washington, partly to power its data centers. It plans to finance the first four of 12 X-Energy SMRs at the site.

Notably, around 80% of SMR projects are being driven by non-traditional customers, primarily large industrial energy users, indicating a significant shift in the nuclear energy customer base from large publicly traded electric generation utilities.

Responses to the Study

Boris Schucht, Chief Executive of Urenco Group, said: “Decarbonizing industry presents a tremendous challenge that we must all embrace if we are to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner.”

“We believe the new-nuclear SMR market holds one of the solutions to this problem: flexible, adaptable technologies that can produce clean energy consistently and affordably.”

“This study acknowledges that with a strong focus on enabling delivery, SMRs can be maximized to their fullest and most competitive potential, significantly enhancing the ability of the nuclear industry to make an important contribution to energy security and net zero goals.”

Kirsty Gogan, Managing Partner of Lucid Catalyst, said:

“We’re witnessing a transformation in how nuclear energy services can be delivered to industrial customers. The innovations in manufacturing, licensing, and siting that this study identifies as being critical for enabling scale are already emerging in the market. With the right policy support and industry coordination across six critical areas, small modular reactors can provide a net-zero solution for energy-intensive industries requiring highly reliable, competitive, and scalable, emissions-free heat and power.”

King Lee, Head of Policy & Industry Engagement at World Nuclear Association, said:

“This study highlights the scale of opportunity for nuclear energy to support decarbonization of a wide range of industrial sectors. To realise the full potential of nuclear energy would require new regulatory frameworks and production and deployment models to unlock the economy and scale of implementation far beyond current projections.”

Affordable Financing For Nuclear Projects is the Missing Link for Success

(NucNet) Stronger international collaboration is needed in a bid to overcome financing and regulatory barriers facing nuclear energy projects in emerging economies, an event organized by the Paris-based OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) to coincide with the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil.

Speaking at a webinar, ‘Unlocking Climate Finance for Nuclear Energy in Emerging Economies’, senior executives from Africa, Asia and global institutions said access to affordable financing is “the missing link” for nuclear projects.

They said the future of nuclear power depends on collective learning, public trust, and equitable access to climate finance.

NEA director-general William Magwood warned that “financing new nuclear facilities remains one of the toughest challenges” for many developing nations, and that multilateral cooperation – including with the World Bank Group – will be essential to bridge both the financial and technical gaps.

“If we are serious about decarbonization, we must be equally serious about giving every country the tools and financial mechanisms to build reliable, clean nuclear energy.”

Nuclear ‘Vital’ To Kenya’s Long-Term Goals

Justus Wabuyabo, chief executive officer of Kenya’s Nuclear Power & Energy Agency (NuPEA) told the webinar that Kenya views nuclear energy as vital to its long-term economic and environmental goals.

He said Kenya completed phase one of its nuclear power program in 2023, focusing on stakeholder engagement and policy readiness, and is now preparing for phase two, due to be completed by 2027. The country plans to begin construction of its first nuclear power plant by 2034.

“The Kenyan government recognizes that nuclear energy will play a crucial role in powering industrialization and creating jobs,” Wabuyabo said.

“It’s not just about energy; it’s about aligning with our climate strategy and supporting national development.”

However, Wabuyabo acknowledged the public has lingering doubts about nuclear technology.

“We must continue building trust,” he said, noting that partnerships with organizations such as the NEA could help Kenya develop robust safety frameworks and transparent communications with communities.

Loyiso Tyabashe, group chief executive of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (NECSA), said South Africa is extending the life of its existing nuclear reactors by up to two decades while also exploring new build options.

Tyabashe said financial planning must precede vendor negotiations, cautioning against premature commitments before securing sustainable capital.

“Quality is linked to the cost of capital,” he said. “Before we even think about technology vendors, we must address financing models. That’s where institutions like the World Bank can be real trend-setters.”

He said Necsa, a public body that carries out nuclear research and development, supports broader African collaboration on nuclear technology, research and skills development and said shared learning can help reduce project costs and ensure regulatory alignment across borders.

Giovanni Carlo Bacardo, undersecretary at the Department of Energy of the Philippines, said his country’s progress depends on access to climate finance and the inclusion of nuclear energy in green taxonomies – the classifications used by investors and international institutions to define sustainable projects.

“For countries like the Philippines, the recognition of nuclear energy as green energy is key to unlocking financing,” Bacardo said. “We are committed to safety and sustainability, but access to affordable capital remains the missing link.”

World Bank ‘Can Be A Trend-Setter’

Lauren Claire Culver, senior energy specialist at the World Bank, which recently signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to cooperate on the development and financing of nuclear power for developing countries, acknowledged that while the organization recognizes nuclear power’s potential role in the global clean energy transition, it still faces an internal knowledge and experience gap.

“We understand the importance of nuclear in addressing climate change,” Culver said, “but the World Bank has limited practical experience in the sector”.

Culver proposed the creation of an advisory board to strengthen dialogue between the World Bank, nuclear regulators and national agencies in emerging economies. She also suggested introducing grant-based resources to help developing countries borrow for technical assistance, capacity building, and regulatory compliance.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/oldbury-site.png,N,,2025-11-16 13:59:43.735070

According to Charged Electric Vehicles Magazine, the process could pump out high-capacity electrodes at a record pace without the use of solvents or ""forever chemicals"" (PFAS).

Powered by Ateios' RaiCure platform, the system can coat electrodes at a speed of 80 meters (262 feet) per minute, nearly three times faster than the standard 30 meters (98 feet) per minute for fluorine-polymer-based electrodes.

Electrode coating is crucial to the battery manufacturing process, as it creates a defect-free surface and directly affects a battery's performance, efficiency, and lifespan. Despite its high speed, the system produces electrodes that work with graphite, lithium cobalt oxide, nickel manganese cobalt, and lithium-iron phosphate battery material.

The fact that the system works with various materials is significant because LFP batteries are made from more abundant materials, which makes them less expensive to manufacture and, presumably, cheaper and more widely available to a broader consumer base.

The manufacturing will take place at Kodak's facility in Rochester, New York. Although the companies state that it will take only two to three months to take a new battery design from lab concept to commercial-scale production, according to Eastman Kodak chief technical officer Terry Taber, the development stage will take a few years, per RochesterFirst.com.

As the world continues to electrify, with EV global sales continuing to rise, it's key that companies such as Ateios can produce quality components at a rate that keeps up with demand.

Innovations such as this could make EVs more affordable. Along with the savings on gas and general maintenance, it could go a long way in convincing consumers to make their next car an EV, reducing the number of gas-powered vehicles on the road and the planet-heating pollution they create.

Home solar is a great way to boost the savings from owning or leasing an EV. EnergySage is a TCD-vetted source that offers tools that allow homeowners to compare quotes from local installers.

The shift toward the sector’s supply chain — from power generators to materials used in data centers — reflects growing concern over lofty valuations in pure-play AI stocks. Analysts say firms supporting the tech ecosystem offer a more affordable entry point into this year’s hottest theme.

The pivot is already showing up in the market. An index tracking Chinese energy stocks rallied 10% in October, and is on track to beat the CSI 300 Index for a second straight month. Seven of the top 10 gainers on the benchmark in the past month are tied to AI infrastructure.

“No power, no AI,” BofA Securities analysts including Matty Zhao wrote in a note dated Oct. 31. They argue that China is better positioned than the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia due to its vast generation capacity, lower power costs, and abundant renewable energy.

By 2030, about one-third of China’s total AI spending will go toward building the supporting facilities, with metals, power, and cooling systems taking the bulk of the outlay, the investment bank estimates.

Here are some of the likely beneficiaries of this boom:

Power Equipment

Power equipment makers are reaping the rewards as data centers drive up electricity demand. UBS Group AG recently doubled its forecast of power demand growth in China to 8% by 2028-2030, citing data centers, exports and electrification as key drivers.

“We prefer local power equipment manufacturers,” said Ken Liu, head of Greater China energy transition & renewables research at a briefing Wednesday, citing the government’s plan to boost energy infrastructure investment in its next five-year plan.

Shares of solar energy equipment maker CSI Solar Co. have jumped 31% this month, while those of electrical component producer TBEA Co. have rallied nearly 21% in the same period. In contrast, the CSI 300 has remained little changed. Even after the rally, the CSI 300 Energy Index trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 13 — well below the multiple of 34 for the index’s information technology sub-gauge.

AI Metals

Metals used to build data centers and other AI facilities — such as servers and energy systems — are another area that’s getting a second look. Prices have been rising, with more analysts now viewing them as affordable ways to invest in the AI boom.

BofA Securities said data centers are becoming a key driver for China’s copper demand, estimating that the metal’s use in these facilities will grow at an average annual rate of 20% through 2030. The brokerage also expects the rally in aluminum stocks to continue.

Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. is among the best performing stocks on the CSI 300 Index over the past month, with around 35% gain, while Shandong Nanshan Aluminum Co. and Yunnan Aluminium Co. have each gained about 30%.

Energy Storage System

Demand for emergency backup equipment is also expected to grow, as data centers seek to maintain uninterrupted power during outages, analysts say.

“This segment is expected to make a significant contribution to A-share listed companies in the future,” said Yishu Yan, a China utilities analyst at UBS Securities.

Citigroup Inc. analysts said the spillover could exceed expectations if the data center growth outlook lines up with rising energy storage demand. That would make renewable energy firms and electric vehicle battery makers likely beneficiaries.

CATL’s Shenzhen-listed shares closed at a new record high on Thursday, after Beijing Hyperstrong Technology said it had locked in an order for 200 gigawatt hours of energy storage batteries from the company. Other battery materials makers also rose, including Shenzhen Capchem Technology, Shenzhen Senior Technology Material, and Eve Energy.

Optical Fibre

Makers of optical transceivers — used to link thousands of advanced chips known as graphics processing units in AI clusters — have also witnessed a sharp rally.

Shares of Zhongji Innolight Co., Eoptolink Technology Inc. and Suzhou TFC Optical Communication Co. have all recorded triple-digit gains this year, making them some of the top performers on China’s onshore equity benchmark.

Those numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change.

Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report’s findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.

There’s no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects, which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy.

We also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan.

You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.

Kirsten: Here’s what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who’s our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It’s a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center.

So to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it.

But of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.

Rebecca: I mean, it’s a lot. And a lot of that’s coming from the U.S. I think that report found that half of the electricity demand will be coming from the U.S., and the rest is a mix of China and Europe.

And another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. So that means there’s a lot more challenge with the grid connection and with connection pathways. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it’s just good business, it’s not because of any environmentally friendly policies.

Kirsten: Redwood Materials’ new business unit, Redwood Energy, is going to be an interesting company to watch with this. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they’re taking the old EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled, and then they’re creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. And that, to me, would alleviate the problem or the concern that you just mentioned.

The question is: Are other companies going to do this? Are there other Redwood Energies out there that are trying to do the same thing? And how much of an impact could they make? Because I do think that like the pressure on the electrical grid, especially during certain times of the year, like in the middle of the summer, for instance, places like Texas that have rolling brownouts and blackouts, that is going to be a real concern. And it could spur a whole new kind of investment into companies doing what Redwood is doing.

Anthony: It also underlines this question about what is that going to do to the spaces that we live in? Even if they’re not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale.

And then, of course, there’s also this question of how much of [the planned data centers are] actually going to get built because there’s definitely very ambitious plans that require huge amounts of spending.

To start with OpenAI, that’s a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade. And then there was this whole controversy over their CFO saying, “The government should backstop our loans to build these data centers.” And then she’s like, “No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t mean backstop, that was a poor choice of words,” but it does look like they have been asking for an expansion of tax credits from the CHIPS Act.

I think that this is going to be an effort that’s not just going to fall on the companies, but also on the government — or at least that’s going to be a question that the government is considering over the next few years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1475927398.jpeg?resize=1200,674",N,,2025-11-16 13:00:39.575278

Countries around the world have been discussing the need to rein in climate change for three decades, yet global greenhouse gas emissions — and global temperatures with them — keep rising.

When it seems like we’re getting nowhere, it’s useful to step back and examine the progress that has been made.

Let’s take a look at the United States, historically the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. Over those three decades, the U.S. population soared by 28 percent and the economy, as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for inflation, more than doubled.

Yet U.S. emissions from many of the activities that produce greenhouse gases — transportation, industry, agriculture, heating and cooling of buildings — have remained about the same over the past 30 years. Transportation is a bit up; industry a bit down. And electricity, once the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, has seen its emissions drop significantly.

Overall, the U.S. is still among the countries with the highest per capita emissions, so there is room for improvement, and its emissions haven’t fallen enough to put the country on track to meet its pledges under the 10-year-old Paris climate agreement. But U.S. emissions are down about 15 percent over the past 10 years.

Here’s how that happened:

U.S electricity emissions have fallen: U.S. electricity use has been rising lately with the shift toward more electrification of cars and heating and cooling and expansion of data centers, yet greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are down by almost 30 percent since 1995.

One of the main reasons for this big drop is that Americans are using less coal and more natural gas to make electricity.

Both coal and natural gas are fossil fuels. Both release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere when they are burned to make electricity, and that carbon dioxide traps heat, raising global temperatures. But power plants can make electricity more efficiently using natural gas compared with coal, so it produces fewer emissions per unit of power.

Why did the U.S. start using more natural gas?

Research and technological innovation in fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed companies to extract more oil and gas at lower cost, making it cheaper to produce electricity from natural gas rather than coal.

As a result, utilities have built more natural gas power plants; especially super-efficient combined-cycle gas power plants, which produce power from gas turbines and also capture waste heat from those turbines to generate more power. More coal plants have been shutting down or running less.

Because natural gas is a more efficient fuel than coal, it has been a win for climate in comparison, even though it’s a fossil fuel. The U.S. has reduced emissions from electricity as a result.

Significant improvements in energy efficiency, from appliances to lighting, have also played a role. Even though tech gadgets seem to be recharging everywhere all the time today, household electricity use, per person, plateaued over the first two decades of the 2000s after rising continuously since the 1940s.

Costs for renewable electricity, batteries fall: U.S. renewable electricity generation, including wind, solar and hydro power, has nearly tripled since 1995, helping to further reduce emissions from electricity generation.

Costs for solar and wind power have fallen so much that they are now cheaper than coal and competitive with natural gas. Fourteen states, including most of the Great Plains, now get at least 30 percent of their power from solar, wind and battery storage.

While wind power has been cost competitive with fossil fuels for at least 20 years, solar photovoltaic power has only been competitive with fossil fuels for about 10 years. So expect deployment of solar PV to continue to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally, even as U.S. federal subsidies disappear.

Both wind and solar provide intermittent power: The sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. There are a number of ways utilities are dealing with this. One way is to use demand management, offering lower prices for power during off-peak periods or discounts for companies that can cut their power use during high demand. Virtual power plants aggregate several kinds of distributed energy resources — solar panels on homes, batteries and even smart thermostats — to manage power supply and demand. The U.S. had an estimated 37.5 gigawatts of virtual power plants in 2024, equivalent to about 37.5 nuclear power reactors.

Another energy management method is battery storage, which is just now beginning to take off. Battery costs have come down enough in the past few years to make utility-scale battery storage cost-effective.

What about driving? In the U.S., gasoline consumption has remained roughly constant but fuel efficiency has generally improved over the decades.

Sales of electric vehicle, which could cut emissions more, have been slow, however. Some of this could be due to the success of fracking: U.S. petroleum production has increased, and gasoline and diesel prices have remained relatively low.

People in other countries are switching to electric vehicles more rapidly than in the U.S. as the cost of EVs has fallen. Chinese consumers can buy an entry-level EV for under $10,000 in China with the help of government subsidies, and the country leads the world in EV sales.

In 2024, people in the U.S. bought 1.6 million EVs, and global sales reached 17 million, up 25 percent from the year before.

The unknowns ahead: What about data centers? The construction of new data centers, in part to serve the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, is drawing a lot of attention to future energy demand and to the uncertainty ahead.

Data centers are increasing electricity demand in some locations, such as northern Virginia, Dallas, Phoenix, Chicago and Atlanta. The future electricity demand growth from data centers is still unclear, though, meaning the effects of data centers on electric rates and power system emissions are also uncertain.

However, AI is not the only reason to watch for increased electricity demand: The U.S. can expect growing electricity demand for industrial processes and electric vehicles, as well as the overall transition from using oil and gas for heating and appliances to using electricity that continues across the country.",https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/40798791_web1_TSR-251115-edh-opi-climate-green-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 13:00:54.299800

Now, reports have emerged that state that the US regulators have approved the planned transmission cable route for the SouthCoast Wind project in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. While the approval is a step in the right direction, a recent court ruling has placed the project in peril and in the crosshairs of the new administration as it aims to roll back permits and policies for the wind power sector in the United States.

The Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board has given its approval for the transmission cable route

The SouthCoast Wind project now has the required approval from the regional regulator for the planned route of the necessary transmission cables for the project. The venture plans to run cables from up the Sakonnet River and across Portsmouth to Mount Hope Bay, connecting the region’s wind power generation at an accelerated pace.

While the approval is a step in the right direction for SouthCoast wind, there have been some new developments that are a cause for concern. Putting aside the current administration’s evident disdain for the wind power sector, a recent ruling by a federal court in DC has raised concerns over the project even being built in the future.

Power purchase agreements for the SouthCoast Wind project are nowhere to be found

Essential to any energy project are the long-term power purchasing agreements that exist between supplier and customer. With the November 1st deadline for PPAs having come and gone, there are no purchasing agreements between the project developer and Massachusetts and Rhode Island utility suppliers. This comes amid growing uncertainty over the wind power sector’s future in Trump’s America.

The Trump administration is rolling back the progress made by the previous President

Biden enacted several measures and policies aimed at shifting the American energy sector towards the renewable energy market. However, a recent request by the Trump administration to roll back permits and review the policies aimed at the wind power sector has been granted by a federal court judge in Washington, DC.

The court’s decision is a major setback for the already struggling project. Despite the approval given for the planned route of transmission cables, the court’s ruling allows the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to establish a new review of potential environmental and economic consequences for the project. Approval for wind projects has been under the spotlight in recent months, not just in the US, but in Australia as well.

“We are currently assessing the implications of the decision and will consider all appropriate next steps, including the pursuit of legal remedies, to ensure the project’s integrity and its long-term contribution to regional and national energy goals.” – Michael Brown, CEO and president for SouthCoast Wind

A clarifying note from COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago is expected today which is anticipated to provide more information on how they intend to resolve outstanding issues in week two. As ministers arrive for the final week of negotiations, answers on how to address the huge shortfall in countries’ emissions reductions commitments, a phaseout of fossil fuels as part of a just transition to a clean energy economy, adaptation, and climate finance are important barometers of progress toward a successful outcome at COP30.

There were some promising bright spots through the week, including growing support for a transition away from fossil fuels, progress on bolstering information integrity to counter climate disinformation and improving synergies between the Rio Conventions to enhance cooperation across international organizations.

Experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) are on the ground in Belém tracking the negotiations and other central issues of importance at COP30.

Below is a statement by Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.

“The first week of COP30 was marked by generally constructive negotiations, but pressure is building as major breakthroughs on critical topics have yet to materialize. Nations repeatedly lamented the vast gulf in ambition between current emission reduction commitments and what’s needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, but a process for how to address that shortfall in an equitable way is still to be decided. Brazil has proposed a roadmap for a transition away from fossil fuels, which is gathering a growing groundswell of support from many countries who recognize the tremendous benefits of renewable energy. Getting the details right will be important to ensure a fair, funded transition and to fend off attacks from fossil fuel interests.

“Securing a strong outcome on climate adaptation is a top issue for climate vulnerable low-income nations and the call has only grown increasingly urgent as climate impacts rapidly worsen around the world. Crucially, a lack of adequate climate finance from richer nations most responsible for the climate crisis remains a festering source of frustration and distrust for lower-income countries.

“It’s up to political leaders to step up to bridge divides between countries in the second week of COP30 and secure a strong outcome that delivers for communities around the world. The stakes are abundantly clear as the world teeters on the brink of breaching 1.5 C of warming and climate change-charged extreme disasters like typhoons and hurricanes take a steep toll on people’s lives and nations’ economies.”

Dr. Cleetus also has a new blog post: As Week One Winds Down at COP30 in Brazil, What’s at Stake and What’s Ahead

Below is a statement by Kate Cell, senior climate campaign manager at UCS and Climate Action Against Disinformation steering committee member and policy working group co-chair.

“This is the first COP where accurate, consistent and reliable information about climate change is on the action agenda. The COP that launched a Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change, signaling unprecedented international collaboration to address pernicious disinformation. The ‘COP of Truth.’ After decades of deceit, denial and delay, the fossil fuel industry and their allies are on notice. And while 12 governments have committed to working together for common-sense, human-rights based solutions, many more must take the opportunity to work together for information integrity.

“This initiative requires holding legacy media, social media and search engines to basic, human-rights based standards of transparency, accountability and safety. Governments, the private sector and funders all have important roles to play. In particular, Big Tech is currently amplifying and monetizing disinformation on a range of topics including climate change, and must instead commit to truth over short-term profits.”

UCS will be monitoring nations as they decide whether to support the Declaration in week two.

Below is a statement by Dr. Astrid Caldas, senior climate scientist for community resilience at UCS.

“The interconnectedness of biodiversity and climate change has been brought to the forefront here in Belém. Taking place in the heart of a biodiversity-rich area, the role of forests and Indigenous and local communities in slowing climate change has been a focal point both in negotiations and civil society fora. Indigenous peoples in particular play an integral role in conservation and stewardship of the land and have been a constant presence at this COP, asserting their rights to land and a seat at the negotiations table. This role can be further prioritized through better synergy between the Rio Conventions, a recommendation supported by many countries and non-governmental organizations. Continued discussions aiming to enhance cooperation among the Rio Conventions and other international groups and frameworks are a welcome signal to better addressing climate change, biodiversity and desertification together. Just as these problems are intertwined, so too must be the unified global response to effectively solve them.”

It might seem obvious why we would want to acquire additional open space — more trails to walk, rivers to kayak, beautiful vistas to enjoy.
But healthy open space is also valuable.
It’s no wonder that Lake County, with its strong tradition of valuing nature, was recently named one of the top 10 counties in the United States for economic development.
• Jessica Vealitzek is president of the Lake County Forest Preserves.","The world is awash in good news.

No, really.

There have been enormous strides in renewable energy use around the world, from Pakistan to Ghana, California to Texas, made possible by everyday people who recognize that using the ball of fire in the sky to power the grid is much more affordable and efficient than fossil fuels and also happens to require no burning, or wars, as environmentalist Bill McKibben has pointed out.

In Illinois, recent legislation will phase out the use of harmful “forever chemicals” in manufacturing, and the number of native gardens surges as more homeowners join the effort to support birds, insects and healthy soil.

Here in Lake County, voters overwhelmingly approved last fall a $155 million bond referendum for the Lake County Forest Preserve District. The district recently issued the first $25 million; the funds will allow us to acquire and restore more land, as well as fund capital projects to increase accessibility for residents throughout the county.

It might seem obvious why we would want to acquire additional open space — more trails to walk, rivers to kayak, beautiful vistas to enjoy. And all of that is true. But healthy open space is also valuable. Some examples:

• Flood control: During the record 2017 floods, LCFPD wetlands held millions of gallons of rainwater. Had those wetlands been paved over, surrounding homes and businesses would have been damaged or destroyed. As more wetlands lose federal protection, it’s imperative for local entities to step up.

• Food production: Pollinators rely on quality habitat and farmers rely on pollinators — honeybee-pollinated commodities alone account for $15 billion in annual U.S. agricultural production, according to the Illinois Farm Bureau.

• Workforce attraction: Homebuyers consistently cite open space as a priority. It’s no wonder that Lake County, with its strong tradition of valuing nature, was recently named one of the top 10 counties in the United States for economic development.

• Health care savings: Studies show the closer one lives to green space, the less they spend on health care — by the hundreds of dollars per year — even taking into account variables like age and income.

Depending on who and what is impacted, the value of a restored acre — meaning, land returned to its natural state — is estimated in the thousands to the tens of thousands of dollars per acre, per year.

Every year.

Today, LCFPD manages about 11,000 acres of restored land. That is a value in the tens of millions of dollars in the form of clean air, water, and soil, flood reduction, pollinator support, carbon storage and more. If LCFPD had the operational funds to restore all 31,500 of its acres ...? Well, you do the math.

One thing is clear: nature is a sound investment.

One of our goals with the referendum dollars is to acquire an additional 2,000 acres, a value potential in the millions of dollars every year, year after year — as long as we taxpayers continue to support the maintenance of restored acres. Because as every gardener knows, it takes constant upkeep.

Americans agree on so much. We value clean air in our lungs and clean water flowing through lakes and rivers. We value the shade of an oak and healthy local food powered by pollinators. We value, and depend on, the quality-of-life nature provides.

November 16, 2025

WASHINGTON — We are happy to report the federal opened back up on Wednesday. In addition to articles already covered by Native News Online, here is a roundup of other news released from Washington, D.C. that impacts Indian Country recently.

Rep. Sharice Davids (D-KS), a tribal citizen of the Ho-Chunk Nation, on Wednesday released a statement following the U.S. House’s passage of the latest government funding bill.

""I’ve said for weeks that we’ve got to come together and find a bipartisan compromise to open the government again, but this can’t be at the expense of threatening health care for the more than 160,000 Kansans who rely on ACA credits to afford care and the thousands more who will see skyrocketing health care premiums. While I’m grateful that federal workers will be back on the job and getting paid, I could not support this government funding bill without any commitment from Speaker Johnson to hold a vote to extend health care credits so that costs don’t surge for Kansas families. Kansans are sick of the political gamesmanship in Washington while people in Kansas pay the price. I am committed to keep fighting in every way I can to bring down the cost of care for Kansans.""

Interior Rescinds 2024 Rule on Alaska Petroleum Reserve to Expand Energy Development

The Department of the Interior on Thursday announced a final rule rescinding the 2024 Bureau of Land Management regulation governing the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska, a move officials say will help unlock the energy potential of the roughly 23-million-acre reserve.

""By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,"" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ""This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.""

Established in 1923, the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska has long been designated to support U.S. energy security. By reversing the 2024 rule, Interior officials say they are advancing efforts to bolster American energy dominance and reduce reliance on foreign oil.

The final rule implements direction from President Donald J. Trump under Executive Order 14153, issued on his first day in office, and responds to calls from Alaskans — including North Slope leaders — to reinstate the prior regulatory framework. Department officials say the change will allow them to focus on expanding responsible development to support Alaska’s economy, national security, and domestic energy production.

The Bureau of Land Management will now proceed with managing the reserve under new 2025 regulations aligned with those originally established in 1977. Agency officials say reversing the 2024 rule will ease regulatory burdens and position the reserve to deliver broader economic benefits for the nation and North Slope communities.

In a globalized world, South-South Cooperation tackles the urgent development challenges the Global South faces through cross-country collaboration spanning the economic, social, political, and environmental spheres. Since its establishment, South-South cooperation has flourished over the decades, with trade among the developing countries amounting to $5.3 trillion in 2021.

In fact, trade flows between developing countries have surpassed trade flows between developing and developed economies. While trade between developed countries has decreased by almost 15% since 1995, trade among countries in the Global South has increased by 14.1%. Between 2000 and 2021, the loan portfolios of South-led development banks also rose significantly. It went from $7.2 billion to $73.4 billion, a tenfold increase.

Promoting Clean Energy and Job Creation

India’s demonstration of converting unused cotton plant parts into clean energy and creating employment opportunities for participants from African countries is a notable example of South-South cooperation.

As India strode towards clean energy, entrepreneurs began utilising the unwanted parts of crops for renewable energy. Instead of setting the waste on fire, a practice that has led to pollution, India has set up more than 500 briquetting plants. Briquetting is a process of converting unused plant parts into clean fuel by forming pellets or briquettes as a substitute for coal and wood.

UNCTAD report highlighted the untapped potential of briquetting in Zambia, where farmers could earn an additional $3 million each year by processing cotton waste into briquettes. Not just Zambia, but cotton farmers globally could greatly benefit from the production of this renewable energy.

Therefore, in 2019, UNCTAD offered officials from Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe the opportunity to visit India and develop a better understanding of the technology. UNCTAD chose India because its cotton production resembles that of these countries, making the technology and equipment adaptable.

South-South Cooperation and the Pandemic

Over the past few years, the converging effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising global food and energy insecurity, and the climate crisis have had a profound impact on the world. For countries in the Global South that were already vulnerable, the high inflation and slowed economic growth in the post-pandemic period, along with droughts, fires, and floods that the climate emergency has brought about, have made things considerably more difficult. In Southeast Asia, the pandemic pushed 4.7 million people into extreme poverty. It undermined the region’s economic and development progress, leading to millions losing their job during the pandemic’s peak.

While there has been a strong recovery, with a 4.6% increase in GDP growth in 2024, millions still face job insecurity and unemployment. As developing countries grapple with these changes, South-South cooperation fosters more sustainable economic growth by driving collective self-resilience.

Promoting Decent Work

The ILO ProSSCE-ASEAN is a project actively working to counteract the post-COVID economic backsliding in the Global South and to achieve decent work for all, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 8.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) launched the Promoting the Global Development Initiative with a focus on South-South cooperation in Employment in ASEAN project in partnership with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China. In Cambodia, the project has partnered with the government and local organisations to connect close to 150,000 young people and marginalised groups to high-quality jobs since 2023.

In Indonesia, the project launched a four-tiered training program to improve job matching by training more than 3,000 public employment counsellors across the country and implementing labour market programmes that are inclusive and gender-responsive. Following the success of the programme in Indonesia, the ILO is set to expand the four-tiered training to other countries in Southeast Asia.

Strengthening South-South Health Cooperation

The pandemic disproportionately affected women and children, particularly in the developing world. It led to a reversal of progress in maternal health, which is a key indicator of health.

In response to this, the World Health Organization (WHO) partnered with the Health Development Partnership for Africa and the Caribbean (HeDPAC) to foster South-South health cooperation between the regions. The initiative brought together countries from Africa and the Caribbean to exchange innovative primary health care solutions, with a focus on maternal and child health.

As the world continues to navigate crises, South-South Cooperation provides a strong framework that encourages solidarity, knowledge sharing, and mutual support among developing countries. Its initiatives aim to foster development based on fairness and resilience, creating an inclusive and sustainable world.

Global EV sales are not just holding steady—they’re accelerating. According to the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025, published in May, electric car sales are projected to exceed 20 million units this year, representing more than one in four cars sold worldwide. This comes despite economic headwinds and policy shifts in key markets.

The narrative of a slowdown has been fueled by selective reporting, but industry analysts argue it’s misleading. A recent article from Electrek highlights how, after two years of dire predictions, EV sales continue to rise, defying claims of cooling demand. ‘EV sales keep defying false media narratives that they are dropping, and continue to rise,’ the piece states, pointing to record-breaking figures in multiple regions.

The Myth of Stagnation

Delving deeper, U.S. sales data from CarEdge, updated as of November 14, 2025, shows electric vehicles capturing 7.9% market share in February, with Tesla leading at 45.2%. This is part of a broader trend where Q3 2025 saw 438,000 units sold—a 30% increase—driven by buyers rushing to claim federal tax credits before potential phase-outs, as reported by MotorWatt.

Globally, BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook, released in June, forecasts EVs comprising one in four cars sold in 2025. China remains the powerhouse, but emerging markets are gaining traction. S&P Global Mobility predicts a 30% rise in battery electric passenger vehicle sales to 15.1 million units, underscoring robust growth.

Regional Dynamics Driving Growth

In Europe and the U.S., the electric commercial vehicle maintenance, repair, and overhaul market is booming, projected to reach $8,440.2 million by 2035 at a 24% CAGR, per Industry Today. India’s EV sales surged to 234,191 registrations in October, up from September, according to EVreporter.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect this optimism. Users like Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, noted in May that ‘in 2024, 1 in 5 cars sold worldwide was electric. In 2025, it’s set to be more than 1 in 4.’ Another post from BloombergNEF emphasizes China’s lead and emerging markets’ takeoff.

Policy Shifts and Market Resilience

Despite U.S. policy uncertainties, including potential tax credit changes, sales momentum persists. Virta Global reports that the number of electric vehicles on roads in 2025 continues to climb, with forecasts pointing to sustained expansion. EV-Volumes provides real-time data showing top models and charging network growth, reinforcing market health.

The Electrek article calls out media sensationalism: ‘After two years of headlines begging for failure, EV sales keep defying false media narratives.’ This echoes sentiments in QY Research’s report, which projects the global EV market to hit $1,257.03 billion by 2031 at a 15.9% CAGR, driven by players like Tesla, BYD, and Volkswagen.

Innovation Fueling Adoption

Technological advancements are key. Future Market Insights forecasts U.S. all-electric multipurpose goods vehicle demand at $298.7 million by 2035, growing at 6.1%. Bloomberg Opinion, citing historical projections, notes EV market share could reach 58% by 2040, with Tesla’s dominance growing.

X posts highlight competitive landscapes: One user points out Tesla’s top-selling models globally, while another notes BYD’s expansion overtaking rivals. Marcelo Mena-Carrasco posted that ‘EVs aren’t “stalling” — they’re surging. Global EV sales are on track for ~22M in 2025.’

Challenges Amid the Surge

Not all is smooth—supply chain issues and battery costs remain hurdles. A 2022 X post from Andy Lee warned of lithium prices tripling, impacting costs, yet sales have soared regardless. Car Dealership Guy forecasted in January that 25% of new vehicles in 2025 would be electrified, with gas engines dropping to 75%.

Edmunds, via KESQ, reports Tesla’s 45.2% U.S. share, but competitors like GM’s Chevy Equinox EV are gaining. OpenPR’s analysis sees transformative growth through sustainability and innovation.

Investor Perspectives and Future Outlook

Investors are bullish. Sawyer Merritt’s X post cites S&P Global’s 30% growth prediction. KRoshan’s post details China’s 32% sales increase, capturing over one-third of the market.

Red/ Snow on X references surging 2025 sales data from multiple sources, countering skepticism. Donald E. Thompson notes global sales jumping from 40,000 annually a decade ago to 22 million in 2025.

Strategic Shifts by Automakers

Automakers are adapting. Ford’s pivot to hybrids amid F-150 Lightning challenges is noted in X discussions, while Rivian and Lucid face cash flow issues. Yet, overall, the sector thrives.

The IEA’s report emphasizes that despite uncertainties, EV adoption is breaking records. As Fatih Birol stated, ‘Global sales of electric cars continue to break records.’

Charging Infrastructure and Market Maturity

Infrastructure lags in some areas, but progress is evident. Y∪² on X predicts EVs dominating in five years with better tech and lower prices, possibly needing state aid for remote charging.

Carlos on X highlights Tesla’s lead, with BYD’s profits declining but still competitive. This competitive churn drives innovation, as per BloombergNEF.

Economic Impacts and Global Reach

The economic ripple is vast. OpenPR forecasts EV market growth through emissions reduction and tech innovation. Europe’s MRO market growth signals maturing ecosystems.

In summary of trends, EV sales defy naysayers, propelled by policy, tech, and consumer shifts.

The Hoosiers enter a much-needed bye week with control of their own destiny for the Big Ten championship and a national championship. Here’s the stock report for IU after week 12.

Stock Up

IU Fan Base

Indiana has sold out their last nine conference home games and have created a home field advantage that head coach Curt Cignetti was raving about after the win over Wisconsin.

“Our fans are the best in America. I know everybody says that that’s got it going and packs the house, but I love our fans. I know where we started and where we are now, and they are over the top. I can’t say enough good things about them. We feed off of their energy. I really think that us playing at home is at least a 14-point advantage.” Cignetti said.

On top of that, multiple people challenged the fans to stay and give a final salute to this team as it looks like Saturday was IU’s final home game of the 2025 season. They answered the bell as about 80-percent of the fans gave a loud ovation as the final gun sounded and the game was over (it did help that it was a beautiful day).

Bye Week Excitement

Usually there are grumbles that a bye week is coming during an undefeated season as fans want to see this team play, but IU needs the bye week. I believe fans understand that too. The Hoosiers are banged up after a six-game stretch that included trips to Oregon and Penn State.

It is a lot easier to enjoy a bye week when your team is 11-0 and the second ranked team in the country. There are several games IU fans will be keeping their eye on this week in the Big Ten (USC at Oregon, Rutgers at Ohio State, Michigan at Maryland) while the mighty SEC takes their annual pre-thanksgiving cupcake festival.

Second Half Performance

The first half of Saturday’s game left a lot to be desired. IU allowed Wisconsin to control the clock and play their style of football. IU led 10-7, but allowed 145 yards of offense. The second half was a different story. IU outscored the Badgers 21-0 and held the Badgers to just 23 yards of offense. The defense also scored 14 points off of two Badger turnovers. IU closed out the game on a 24-0 run, something IU fans have been used to seeing under Cignetti.

Stock Down

Offensive Line

The Indiana offensive line is missing Drew Evans and was severely limited because of Kahlil Benson being banged up. IU allowed five sacks and seven tackles for loss. Last week against Penn State, IU surrendered three sacks. While quarterback Fernando Mendoza did hold on to the ball too long on some plays, he is taking too many hits. Eight sacks in the last two games nearly came to a head when Mendoza was a little slow and wobbly getting up in the fourth quarter Saturday.

First Half Tackling

One of the reasons why Indiana started slowly was their issues with tackling again. The Hoosiers struggled on Wisconsin’s first drive, and really the first half, with angles and wrapping up. According to Pro Football Focus, IU missed six tackles yesterday.

“We just came out flat, honestly. We didn’t have a lot of energy. Some guys weren’t ready to go, and I will take the blame for that. I don’t think I was ready to go. I think I could’ve had more energy and been more of a sparkplug for the team. You know, (it’s) something we have got to work on. We can’t have that in a big game. So, we have to eliminate that now, get back to training towards the end of the season. We are looking forward to Purdue and writing that off.” Indiana linebacker Aiden Fisher said.

Injuries

The Hoosiers are more banged up than the official availability says they are. IU was without starters wide receiver Elijah Sarratt and Drew Evans to start the game and then saw starters EJ Williams, Kaelon Black, Kahlil Benson and Mikail Kamara leave the game early as well. IU already lost Lee Beebe, Bryson Bonds and Kellan Wyatt for the season. IU needs to get healthy.

Hold

Undefeated Regular Season

There is one more game to go for 12-0 and it is the Old Oaken Bucket Game. IU has a chance to recover both physically and mentally before heading to West Lafayette on Black Friday. Anything can happen if a rivalry game…Just ask Ohio State.",https://i0.wp.com/hoosierhuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/USATSI_27594273-e1763305811808.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 13:02:22.516989

November 16, 2025 - OAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Friday joined a coalition of 22 attorneys general and two states in filing a motion for a preliminary injunction to ensure that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) preserves funding for the Solar for All federal grant program while litigation is pending. In August, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would terminate the Solar for All program, asserting the agency no longer had statutory authority to administer the funds. Administrator Zeldin’s directive terminated nearly $250 million in funds owed to California, where state agencies were preparing to build out community solar and associated clean energy projects. In October, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition challenged the Trump Administration in a pair of lawsuits over the unlawful termination of this funding. In today’s motion, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the coalition asks the District Court to freeze congressionally appropriated Solar for All funds — including both the funds still in the states’ accounts and the funds already taken out — so that the Court can restore the program later if the coalition is ultimately successful in their litigation. A preliminary injunction will ensure that the funds are protected from being moved outside of EPA, where they could become unrecoverable.

“Without the District Court’s intervention, states including California will experience irreparable harm from the EPA’s actions,” said Attorney General Bonta. “That’s why we, alongside a broad coalition of attorneys general, are filing this motion to protect funding for the Solar for All program—a nationwide program that promises to address climate change, stimulate the economy, and promote energy independence and grid reliability, while also lowering energy costs.”

In 2022, Congress appropriated $7 billion to EPA through the Inflation Reduction Act specifically to develop competitive grant programs to expand solar energy access nationwide. EPA designed the Solar for All program to provide financial and technical assistance for the deployment of zero-emission technology, including residential and distributed solar to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in low-income and disadvantaged communities. EPA issued 60 competitive awards in 2024 to states, municipalities, and non-profit organizations, ranging from $43.5 million to almost $250 million per recipient.

In their motion, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition argue that:

The states are likely to prevail in their claims that the Trump Administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and congressional mandates.

The states will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief prohibiting EPA from de-obligating and reprogramming Solar for All funding. In California, state agencies were expecting to receive almost $250 million, including more than $200 million to build out community solar systems, which would enable California residents to obtain 20% monthly discounts on electricity bills in exchange for participating in the Solar for All program—primarily aimed at lower- and middle-income families. The funding also included $9 million for workforce training—enabling more California workers to acquire skills needed to help build a sustainable future.

The irreparable harms that would flow from EPA’s decision to move the Solar for All funds outside of the agency overwhelmingly favor preliminary injunctive relief.

In filing today’s motion for a preliminary injunction, Attorney General Bonta joins the attorneys general of Arizona, Washington, Minnesota, the District of Columbia, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

The project will enable Spain to become a regional leader in the production of renewable hydrogen, which has become the trendy option for the renewable energy sector.

Repsol’s industrial complex in Cartagena is set for a massive electrolyzer to be installed

Repsol is the largest producer of renewable hydrogen in Spain, but is also the largest consumer of the renewable energy resource. In a move that accelerates Spain’s energy transition ambitions, the company has given the go-ahead for a 100 MW electrolyzer to be built and installed at its industrial complex in the East of Spain.

The electrolyzer will be capable of producing approximately 15,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually, and has the added benefit of avoiding emissions of up to 167,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. If that wasn’t enough to get the excitement brewing, the Cartagena electrolyzer has been selected by the European Commission as a strategic project of common European interest, which means it can rely on substantial funding from the EU as well.

Repsol aims to replace conventional hydrogen with renewable hydrogen at its industrial sites

The company has outlined its plans to completely replace the conventional hydrogen at its industrial sites across Spain with the all-new clean and renewable hydrogen that the electrolyzer produces. This would mark a significant step in changing the roadmap for Spain’s energy future as the nation aims to lean on the renewable energy sector over the next decade.

The project will receive €155 million from the Spanish government authorities

The fact that the project aligns with EU and Spanish clean energy goals, and that it has been designated as strategically important for the European Union, means that the Spanish Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Energy (IDAE) will allocate up to €155 million for the project. That is on top of the already substantial investment made by Repsol and Enagas, which holds a 25% stake in the project.

The new electrolyzer will help Spain avoid significant emissions that exceed the current levels avoided by the entire EV sector in the nation, which is saying a lot, as Spain has embraced the emission-cutting benefits of the EV sector. Securing financing from the EU can be seen as a milestone for any project, as the EU does not take its role in the global energy transition lightly. As evidenced by the recent news that it will back a Baltic Sea hydrogen project.

“The plant is expected to be operational in 2029, representing a milestone for the Hydrogen Valley of the Region of Murcia, one of Spain’s most important regional initiatives. The goal is to create the most efficient ecosystem possible, aligning production capacity with the needs of industry. The project also includes the possibility that, in the future, the renewable hydrogen can be fed into the natural gas network and the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone.” – Repsol press release

This seems impossible, but the cooperation between Volkswagen Group and Rivian to develop software for electric vehicles is going so well that the two companies are thinking they could market their digital expertise to other automakers. Is this the same Volkswagen that has floundered for nearly a decade to get its software to work properly? The same company that created CARIAD, a new software division, then fired all the senior executives and started over from scratch before finally throwing in the towel and outsourcing the task to Rivian? That Volkswagen?

The answer, according to the Detroit News, is “Yes!” It reports that the joint venture created by Volkswagen and Rivian — known as RV Tech — has made great progress toward delivering the EV electrical and software platform that Volkswagen Group needs to compete with Tesla and Chinese automakers.

RV Tech is focused on delivering software systems for Rivian and Volkswagen, but is open to talking to third parties about using those platforms, which are designed to be scalable across vehicle sizes and segments in Western markets.

“We’re solving a problem for the larger automotive industry,” Wassym Bensaid, Rivian’s software chief and RV Tech co-chair, told journalists at an event in Palo Alto, California, on November 12, 2025. “That could become an opportunity” for others as well, he said. “There’s no Rivian versus VW versus Audi. It’s Rivian, and Audi, and VW, and potentially in the future other OEMs because of the breadth and scalability of the technology solution that we’re building.”

RV Tech Sees Licensing Opportunities

The earning potential from licensing the technology “is a very different ballgame and a very different margin profile from a business standpoint than making cars,” Bensaid said. RV Tech also said it will begin testing the system soon in winter conditions on Audi, Volkswagen, and Scout models, starting in the first quarter of 2026.

Volkswagen is grappling with tariffs in the US, shrinking deliveries in China, and muted demand in Europe. As part of its push to cut costs and bolster sales, it has turned to Rivian for the kind of software and EV technology its initial battery-powered models were missing. The automaker is investing as much as $5.8 billion in the alliance, making it one of Volkswagen Group’s biggest strategic bets ever.

Two months ago, Germany’s Manager Magazin reported that the relationship between Rivian and Volkswagen is experiencing some turbulence. “Volkswagen is reportedly encountering extensive problems in its partnership with Rivian. As a result, electric models intended to run on Rivian software are apparently delayed. Furthermore, Rivian’s algorithms cannot simply be transferred to internal combustion engines, which Volkswagen now seems likely to keep in the line-up for longer,” it wrote.

Highly placed sources said Audi’s Q8 e-tron SUV and A4 e-tron may be delayed by at least a year, moving their launch date back to mid or late 2028. The debut of Porsche’s K1 SUV, which is supposed to be a battery electric model positioned above the Cayenne due in showrooms by late 2027, is now postponed indefinitely.

There was even a suggestion in that report that CARIAD, bloodied and bruised by constant corporate infighting and upheavals, might be resurrected, as Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume tries to find someone — anyone — who can solve the company’s ongoing software issues.

Zonal Architecture

When the joint venture was created a year ago, it brought together software developers and engineers from both companies. Like Tesla, BYD, and Xiaomi, RV Tech is using zonal architecture which requires fewer individual controllers to oversee a wider range of functions in the car’s front, central, and rear sections, thus reducing costs for both companies. For Rivian, which has yet to become profitable, the investment from Volkswagen Group is a financial lifeline as demand for electric vehicles softens for a number of policy reasons.

While RV Tech is putting a priority on ramping up and delivering software platforms for electric models, there are parallels that would allow the technology to be used for combustion engine cars as well, co-chair Carsten Helbing told the press last week.

Rivian R2 First Up

The first vehicle to use the new technology will be the R2 sport utility vehicle from Rivian that’s expected to debut in the first quarter of 2026. The first Volkswagen product to use it will be the ID.1 that is on track to appear in 2027. That compact EV is expected to sell for about €20,000 ($23,000) in Europe, where it will compete with the new battery electric Twingo from Renault and a number of low-cost models from Chinese manufacturers.

After the ID.1 goes on sale, the next vehicles from Volkswagen to use the software package from RV Tech will be the new pickup truck and SUV from Scout Motors, perhaps in 2028. Those vehicles were intended to be battery electrics until the Moron of Mar-A-Loco blew into town and snuffed out every forward-leaning program in existence in the US. That caused Volkswagen to rethink its sales strategy and add plug-in hybrid powertrains to the Scout mix.

It could have been worse. The German company could have revived its turbo diesel powertrains for its Scout models. The question now is whether those plug-in hybrids will have wimpy little batteries that condemn the vehicles to relying on their internal combustion engines most of the time, or whether they will have enough battery-only range to qualify as true PHEVs that use the electric motor primarily and keep the gas engine in reserve for occasional use.

There is no suggestion in the current reporting that the disruptions Manager Magazin reported are holding up progress. Apparently, the software platform is now capable of supporting at least plug-in hybrid architecture, which could be a big plus for the joint venture as it explores the possibility of marketing its software to other companies. Plug-in hybrids are the new darlings of the automotive world, as enthusiasm for battery-powered cars cools.

Volkswagen’s earlier efforts to develop software in-house largely stumbled, first by holding up launches of its namesake brand’s ID models, then by handicapping sales of those vehicles because of buggy features. Volkswagen Group, which also includes Audi and Porsche and a handful of other brands, has seen EV sales rise in Europe this year after improving software and updating models, Bloomberg says.

Software-defined vehicles are relatively new to the world of automobiles, and many legacy automakers are finding it hard to incorporate digital systems into their cars. Volkswagen has been out in left field now for almost a decade. Has it finally turned the corner and gotten on a path that could see it selling software systems to other manufacturers? That would be quite a turnaround indeed.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RV-Tech.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 11:05:09.397297

This would be coordinated through the Green Climate Fund (GCF), an institutional mechanism that has been at work since 2015, to fund projects in developing countries to adapt to unfolding climate change as well as to invest in clean energy.

Despite being the world’s largest institutional mechanism for disbursing funds for climate finance, with commitments worth $19 billion, only a quarter of it has been properly allocated as of 2024. The GCF faces criticism from developing countries that its disbursal mechanisms are often difficult to comply with and there is limited technical support to avail these funds.

A stated goal of the GCF is to ensure that its funds are evenly split between adaptation and mitigation.

The Belem ministerial event, co-hosted by Brazil’s Ministry of Finance and the GCF, brought together ministers and other senior government officials as well as international, national, public, and private climate finance leaders.

Away from ‘fragmented approach’

While India already engages with the GCF, it is believed that a new ‘country platform’ for “climate and nature finance” would help the country move away from a “fragmented approach” towards accessing funds. This is especially significant in a year when calls from developing countries for prioritising adaptation and improving access to climate finance are particularly resonant, especially at the ongoing proceedings of COP30. The Hindu reached out to the Environment Ministry for more clarity on the country platform but did not receive a comment until press time.

Halfway through negotiations on Saturday (November 15, 2025), India was leading developing countries’ clamour for a focussed discussion and roadmap on a section of the Paris Agreement called Article 9.1 that mandates developed countries provide funds for mitigation and adaptation.

The announcement of such a platform also ties in with expectations that negotiators may finalise a list of indicators that can be used to measure progress towards the so-called Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). Progress on producing an agreed list of indicators has been difficult, with nearly 90 experts working over two years to narrow down a list of almost 10,000 potential indicators to a final set of just 100, which is supposed to be adopted at COP30, according to a report by Molly Lempriere, an analyst for Carbon Brief, an agency that tracks climate negotiations.

However, with India, among other countries expected to announce National Adaptation Plans, there is greater vocal support and interest in having a concrete outcome on the GGA.

GCF’s India commitments

Announcing their country and regional platforms, representatives from the African Islands States Climate Commission (AISCC), Cambodia, Colombia, India, Kazakhstan, Lesotho, Mongolia, Nigeria, Oman, Panama, Rwanda, the Dominican Republic, Togo, and South Africa shared their vision and strategies for leveraging country platforms to accelerate climate action. This brings the number of platforms to 16, with the previously established Brazil Country Platform and Caribbean Regional Platform, according to a note from the GCF.

As of August 2024, India has received commitment from the GCF for 11 projects/programmes worth $782 million to mitigate and adapt to climate change in sectors, including water, clean energy, coastal, livelihood, transport, medium and small enterprises and climate start-ups. A bulk of the financing is in the form of concessional loans.

India’s Environment Ministry is the primary access point (or the Nodal Designated Authority) for GCF-linked funding. While being a recipient of funds, it has sought expertise in being able to equip State governments and private entities in the country to be able to effectively engage with the NDA and the GCF to access these funds.

The new initiative will be guided by a steering committee with a majority of representatives from developing countries. Organisationally, the Country Platforms Hub will operate through a lean secretariat, supported by the Africa Climate Foundation (ACF) during its incubation period. Initial funding amounts to nearly $4 million and will support early activities, including governance, coordination, knowledge sharing, and a spark plug window for designing early-stage national platforms.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3r0k8y/article70287617.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/cop30%20climate%20finance.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 16:03:42.762148

United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.
Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.
“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren’t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action — on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more — including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Decision time

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad as it could be.”

Momentum to phase out fossil fuels

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Getting Indigenous voices heard

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

Second, that Canada would hit the government’s industrial greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

Third, that most Canadian households would be financially better off as a result.

To the contrary, a recent study by the fiscally conservative Fraser Institute estimates that over the past decade, the federal, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and B.C. governments have spent or foregone revenues of $158 billion in inflation-adjusted 2024 dollars to create a mere 68,000 “clean energy” jobs.

That’s an estimated cost of $2.3 million per job.

GOLDSTEIN: Carney’s budget won’t fix decade of Trudeau’s economic mismanagement

“Governments, activists and special interests groups have been making a lot of claims about the opportunities of a clean economic transition, but after a decade of policy interventions and more than $150 billion in taxpayers’ money, the results are underwhelming,” said Elmira Aliakbari, co-author of the study titled The Fiscal Cost of Canada’s Low-Carbon Economy.

A second Fraser Institute study – Sizing Canada’s Clean Economy – concluded that after almost a decade of federal and provincial governments funnelling billions of dollars into the “clean economy” from 2014 to 2023, its percentage of Canada’s total economy of $3.3 trillion barely moved from 3.1% of GDP to 3.6%.

Do you worry about future generations dealing with the debt racked up by the Liberals

Yes

No

As for meeting federal emission targets, the Canadian Climate Institute and the Trottier Energy Institute at Polytechnique Montreal recently concluded the Liberals’ target of reducing Canada’s emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels in 2030 is out of reach and that the government will achieve, at best, half of that.

The parliamentary budget office – a watchdog on federal spending – reported that before Carney cancelled the consumer carbon tax, most Canadian families were in fact paying more in carbon taxes than they received in rebates, when factoring in the negative impact of the carbon tax on the Canadian economy.

During the last election, Carney promised to replace the consumer carbon tax with an “improved and tightened” industrial carbon tax that would benefit both consumers and businesses. But his recent budget, while containing nine pages about his so-called climate competitiveness strategy, had no specifics on how it will work.

Call it a myth in the making.

The project’s completion was celebrated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, the Ouachita Parish Police Jury, the Ouachita Parish Industrial Development Board, RWE leadership, employees, and construction partner McCarthy Building Companies.
Economic Impact: Jobs, Local Spending, and $32 Million in Tax Revenue The Lafitte Solar project is projected to deliver long-term benefits for Ouachita Parish and the Monroe region.","RWE has officially completed construction on its first-ever project in Louisiana: the 100 MW Lafitte Solar project in Ouachita Parish, delivering a major milestone for both the company and the state’s renewable energy transition. Located just outside Monroe, the project is expected to be fully operational and producing clean electricity by the end of the year, marking a new chapter for solar development in northern Louisiana.

Enabled through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Meta, the Lafitte Solar project will supply low-cost, renewable energy to the Louisiana grid. Through the agreement, Meta will also receive the project’s environmental benefits, including Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), helping the company move closer to its clean energy and sustainability goals.

The project’s completion was celebrated at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, the Ouachita Parish Police Jury, the Ouachita Parish Industrial Development Board, RWE leadership, employees, and construction partner McCarthy Building Companies.

Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy, highlighted the significance of the milestone:

""Lafitte Solar is RWE's first project in Louisiana, and will provide low-cost, homegrown energy to the Louisiana grid and generate enough electricity to power 17,000 local homes and businesses. By providing affordable and reliable electricity, we are strengthening Monroe's power supply while supporting the community's growth and resilience.""

Economic Impact: Jobs, Local Spending, and $32 Million in Tax Revenue

The Lafitte Solar project is projected to deliver long-term benefits for Ouachita Parish and the Monroe region. Over the course of its operations, it is expected to generate approximately $32 million in regional tax revenue, supporting key public services such as:

Local schools

Law enforcement

Emergency services

Community infrastructure

During peak construction, the project supported 150+ full-time jobs, many of which were filled by local workers. Crews partnered with RWE’s EPC contractor, McCarthy Building Companies, whose teams contributed to local spending by patronizing restaurants, shops, and service businesses throughout the parish.

Joe Holyfield, President of the Ouachita Industrial Development Board, emphasized the project’s immediate economic value:

""Lafitte Solar brought jobs and investment to Ouachita Parish at a crucial time. Our local businesses felt an immediate benefit, and we look forward to sustained growth as energy projects like these strengthen our region's future.""

Meta also applauded the milestone, underscoring the project’s dual benefits of economic growth and clean energy adoption.

Amanda Yang, Head of Clean and Renewable Energy at Meta, said:

Community Investment: Schools, Parks, and Food Security

RWE and McCarthy have committed deeply to community programs in the greater Monroe area, extending the project’s impact beyond electricity generation.

Their contributions include:

Donations to Roy Neal Shelling, Sr. Elementary School for classroom supplies

Holiday toy contributions from McCarthy

Funding a new playground at Tanglewood Community Park

One of the largest holiday food donations ever received by the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana

These investments were designed to support families, expand youth recreation access, and improve quality of life across Ouachita Parish—highlighting RWE’s long-term commitment to local partnerships, not just project construction.

Sustainable Land Use and Agrivoltaics: A Dual-Purpose Model

Lafitte Solar has also been designed to support Louisiana’s agricultural landscape through a combination of biodiversity initiatives and agrivoltaic practices.

Key features include:

Native and natural vegetation planted around the project perimeter to protect local habitats

Collaboration with Louisiana farmers to introduce a flock of 600+ sheep for vegetation management

Preservation of surrounding farmlands through low-impact land use practices

This dual-purpose agricultural–solar model reduces the need for mechanical mowing, supports local livestock operations, and enhances soil health. It also demonstrates how renewable energy projects can function in harmony with Louisiana’s farming culture—an increasingly important approach as the state balances economic development with environmental protection.

Why This Project Matters for Louisiana’s Energy Future

Lafitte Solar arrives at a critical moment for Louisiana, a state historically dependent on natural gas and petrochemical industries. The project:

Diversifies the state’s power mix

Contributes to resilience as regions adopt more grid-stabilizing renewables

Attracts large corporate buyers like Meta that seek renewable power for operations

Strengthens rural economic development through infrastructure and job creation

For RWE, this project is part of a broader push across the United States, where the company is now the third largest renewable energy developer with more than 2,000 employees and over 10 gigawatts of operating wind, solar, and storage projects.

These resources, largely concentrated in the Sembar and Ranikot formations of the Lower Indus Basin, could transform Pakistan’s energy profile if developed successfully.
In July–August 2025, high-level talks culminated in a new trade agreement aimed at developing Pakistan’s oil reserves and reducing bilateral tariffs.
Toward an energy-independent future Pakistan’s energy challenge is undeniable, but so too is its potential.
If managed wisely, Pakistan could move from chronic dependency toward becoming a more resilient, self-sufficient player in the global energy landscape.","Pakistan stands at a pivotal juncture in its energy journey, where persistent dependence on imported oil and gas collides with the promise of untapped domestic potential. New discoveries, seismic surveys and growing international interest point toward opportunities that could ease the country’s reliance on imports and enhance long-term energy security. At the same time, policymakers and industry leaders are exploring ways to channel investment into local resources while cultivating global partnerships to unlock this promise.

Rising domestic reserves: A glimpse of self-reliance

As of December 2024, Pakistan’s proven oil reserves stood at approximately 238 million barrels, representing a 23% increase from around 193 million barrels in December 2023. This growth, though modest in global terms, underscores the country’s latent potential and highlights the importance of sustained investment in domestic exploration. Despite this encouraging rise, domestic production still falls short of meeting national demand, keeping Pakistan reliant on imports to fuel its industries, transport and households.

The scale of this reliance is significant. In the fiscal year 2023–2024, Pakistan’s petroleum import bill reached $15.1 billion, according to the State Bank of Pakistan, while some sources reported a slightly higher figure of $16.9 billion.

This consistent outflow of foreign exchange underscores the importance of developing local reserves as a top priority. Every barrel produced domestically represents not just a saving in import costs, but also a step towards greater national resilience.

Shale energy: Pakistan’s untapped frontier

Beyond conventional oil and gas, Pakistan is among the world’s most promising nations in terms of shale energy potential. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Pakistan may hold up to nine billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil and around 105 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. These resources, largely concentrated in the Sembar and Ranikot formations of the Lower Indus Basin, could transform Pakistan’s energy profile if developed successfully.

It is important to note, however, that these remain geological assessments rather than proven reserves. Unlocking them would require extensive drilling, advanced technologies and a carefully phased development strategy. Industry estimates suggest that an initial investment of $5 billion or more, along with several years of effort, would be necessary before commercial-scale extraction becomes feasible.

Yet, this challenge also represents an opportunity. Pakistan has the chance to build partnerships with technologically advanced nations and multinational energy firms that can bring the expertise, capital and innovation needed to realize these resources. By positioning itself as an attractive investment destination, Pakistan could set the stage for a major transformation in its energy sector.

The Pakistan-US investment relationship holds untapped strategic value, particularly in critical sectors like minerals, energy, information technology (IT) and agriculture. Pakistan’s mineral reserves, valued between $6–8 trillion, including copper, lithium and rare earths, offer a strategic edge. These resources are crucial for the US clean energy transition and technological security.

The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has been a pivotal enabler in streamlining procedures and boosting investment, especially in sectors like renewables and mining. US foreign direct investment (FDI) in Pakistan remains underutilized, with further engagement in energy development and mineral extraction critical for both countries’ long-term economic interests.

Offshore exploration: the next energy frontier

Momentum is also being built offshore. In early 2024, a multi-year seismic survey was conducted in the offshore Indus Basin, which detected promising subsurface structures containing hydrocarbons.

While still at an early stage, these findings suggest that Pakistan’s coastal regions may hold the key to future discoveries. Successful offshore exploration would not only diversify the energy mix but also elevate Pakistan’s status as a serious player in the global energy market.

These initiatives underline the fact that Pakistan is far from resource-poor; rather, it is a nation on the cusp of converting geological promise into economic strength. With the right strategies and partnerships, it could unlock reserves that support industrial growth, create jobs and stabilize its balance of payments.

Energy development cannot be viewed in isolation; it is deeply tied to Pakistan’s international partnerships. Since its independence in 1947, Pakistan’s relationship with the United States has been shaped by both geopolitical shifts and enduring economic cooperation. Despite ups and downs, the trade and investment relationship has proven resilient, with the US consistently ranking among Pakistan’s largest trading partners.

Today, the United States is not only Pakistan’s largest export market, accounting for about 17% of total exports, but also a leading source of foreign direct investment. US companies have been active in consumer goods, information and communications technology (ICT), renewable energy and financial services, bringing global expertise and creating local opportunities. Pakistan, in turn, has exported textiles, apparel and a growing range of goods to the US, cementing the bilateral trade corridor as one of the most important in South Asia.

The momentum has accelerated further in recent months. In July–August 2025, high-level talks culminated in a new trade agreement aimed at developing Pakistan’s oil reserves and reducing bilateral tariffs. The accord promises not only to deepen cooperation in hydrocarbons but also to expand market access for Pakistani exports.

US President Donald Trump even suggested that future exploration could position Pakistan as an energy exporter to regional markets such as India — an ambitious but symbolic indicator of Pakistan’s potential.

Toward an energy-independent future

Pakistan’s energy challenge is undeniable, but so too is its potential. Rising proven reserves, significant shale prospects and encouraging offshore surveys highlight a future that could be shaped by reform, innovation and foreign investment.

For partners like the United States, deeper engagement in Pakistan’s energy sector is not only an economic opportunity but also a strategic investment in regional stability. If managed wisely, Pakistan could move from chronic dependency toward becoming a more resilient, self-sufficient player in the global energy landscape.

Experts highlighted legal gaps that allow agricultural runoff and waste from large farms to go largely unregulated.

Speakers suggested tying conservation requirements to farm subsidies, as voluntary programs have proven insufficient.

More than 60 people attended a town hall at Drake University's Meredith Hall to discuss ways in which the debate regarding statewide water concerns can be geared toward producing solutions.

The event, held Saturday, Nov. 15, was a follow-up to an August meeting during which hundreds watched the first presentation of a landmark, $1 million Polk County report that tied agricultural practices to widespread water pollution.

The report came at a time when the local water supplies were so contaminated with nitrates tied to farm runoff that Central Iowa Water Works had issued a temporary ban on lawn watering ―the first ever in the region ― to keep water demand from outstripping treatment capacity.

Here are three key focuses that arose from Saturday’s town hall.

An encore presentation in Iowa City in late October drew more than 200 people.

“After all of these presentations, after that really excellent report, there's a common question that we keep getting, and that question is, ‘What would we do about it?’” said Adam Shriver, director of wellness and nutrition policy at the Harkin Institute, a public policy research nonprofit at Drake that hosted the initial presentation. “That question is really what we want to start to answer today.”

Historically, the state of Iowa has declined to impose any mandatory measures on farmers to reduce runoff, instead relying on voluntary programs. A federal court dismissed a 2017 lawsuit filed by Des Moines Water Works seeking to force regulation in northwest Iowa water districts.

Gov. Kim Reynolds, questioned about the Polk County report in July, said “regulation is hardly ever the answer.” The Trump administration in August pulled the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency list of Iowa waterways in need of pollution reduction measures. And the state has moved to eliminate a system for monitoring Iowa waters for pollutants, although local entities led by Polk County have allocated funds to keep the University of Iowa-operated initiative active.

Speakers and organizers from Food & Water Watch, Progress Iowa, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and the Harkin Institute led discussions Saturday on potential responses to nitrate contamination, pesticide use, factory farm impacts and gaps in state water oversight.

“We know about the challenges that we're facing for our water and our health, and what seems sometimes like a lack of motivation among some of our leaders to do much about those problems,” Shriver said. “But it's also a moment where the problems have become too big to ignore.”

Closing the legal gaps that keep ag water pollution unregulated

A recurring theme during the town hall was policy gaps that allow pollution from agricultural operations to go largely unchecked.

Michael Schmidt, general counsel for the Iowa Environmental Council, said that when water quality fails to meet required standards, officials are typically tasked with determining what level of pollution is unacceptable and identifying any major point-source contributors. Those often include factories and sewage treatment plants.

Current policy, though, does not assign limits to nonpoint sources, including agricultural runoff, leaving them effectively outside regulation.

Schmidt pointed to the state’s oversight of concentrated animal feeding operations as an example of how that gap plays out.

He said the state relies on a scoring system called the master matrix that lets such facilities be built if operators can prove they can keep manure discharge below a maximum threshold.

That framework, he said, has not kept pace with the scale of modern operations. Some egg operations in Iowa, for instance, can house millions of hens, but few such facilities are under permits that would allow regulation of their waste discharges.

“We’ve had in a 10-year period, close to 400 manure releases and at any given time, we have fewer than 200 of these that have a clean water active"" permit, Schmidt said

In Iowa, the cost of polluting the state’s waterways is surprisingly low, he added. The median penalty for manure releases is about $3,000, he said.

“So if you have a few thousand animals and incur one penalty, because you don’t get caught very often, $3,000 is just the cost of doing business,” Schmidt said.

Requirements tied to incentives, not voluntary programs

Speakers also addressed how Iowa’s current reliance on voluntary conservation has not yielded meaningful, sustained reductions in nutrient pollution.

“We have been attempting voluntary conservation practices since 1935, plus-90 years ago,” Schmidt said.

He said pressures that deter voluntary compliance are reinforced by incentives built into existing farm programs.

“Economically, we are paying people to maximize production,” Schmidt said, adding that taxpayer-subsidized crop insurance and commodity supports have encouraged large-scale production instead of diversification of crops to embrace ones less dependent on nitrate fertilizers.

He pointed to the 1985 farm bill as an example of when tying requirements to subsidies produced noticeable change.

“We decided we are going to condition the receipt of these subsidies on not filling wetlands,” he said, calling it evidence of what happens when conservation is mandatory rather than optional.

Schmidt said progress under Iowa’s voluntary approach remains far too slow.

“We are making some progress,” he said, “but it will take several thousand years.”

Generating grassroots pressure and involvement

John Norris, a lawyer at the Horizon Group, a marketing research and management consultant company that works to encourage effective changes, said the push for better water quality will depend on whether Iowans treat it as a priority.

Norris, who was Polk County administrator when the water report was commissioned, said the reason for it was to increase the knowledge of Iowans about the state of Iowa's water quality. His hope, he said, is that candidate's stances on water quality and environmental issues will become key factors in voting outcomes.

Norris said he believes long-term gains require policy changes, not just improved awareness.

“It’s going to be a change in policies that get us out of this,” he said.

He said those shifts have come with their share of resistance.

“When you have a change in policy, the politics of that are we are threatening the power of people who are benefiting from this policy, and then you get into money and politics and power,” he said.

He said the Horizon Group has begun collaborating with researchers to identify what Iowa’s monitoring and data systems should look like. He said any policy shift must also consider farmers’ position in the current system.

“We’re cautious not to just throw farmers on the bus here,” he said. “They have farmed the way that they have been required to farm to stay in business. We’ve got to change that for them.”

Schmidt said he’s seen similar public momentum across the state, adding, ""This really is something that extends far beyond our region, and I think is a moment in Iowa’s history where people are very much ready for change.”

He said he believes progress will depend on involvement from multiple fronts.

“Ultimately, change is going to have to come from many different types of efforts that are all moving towards a common goal,” he said. “What today is about is recognizing the importance of grassroots efforts and the work that can be done by people in this group.”","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/15/PDEM/85218748007-071525-icon-water-trails-groundbreaking-ls-10.jpg?crop=8639,4861,x0,y449&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-16 11:04:58.355029

We believe that horticulture and the green sector play a major role in the urban planning of our sustainable cities and communities”

— H.E Dr. Mohammed Salman Alhammadi

DUBAI, DUBAI EXHIBITION CENTRE (EXPO CITY), UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, November 16, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Under the patronage of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment the inaugural edition of Myplant & Garden Middle East 2025 opened today at the Dubai Exhibition Centre, Expo City Dubai. The exhibition was officially inaugurated by HE Dr. Mohammed Salman Alhammadi, Assistant Undersecretary for the Food Diversity Sector at MOCCAE, alongside HE Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of Dubai Municipality, in the presence of government officials, international delegations and key industry stakeholders.

The launch of this exhibition marks an important milestone for the UAE and the wider region as nations accelerate efforts to build climate-resilient, nature-positive cities aligned with ‘We the UAE Vision 2031’ and broader sustainability frameworks. It also reflects the growing strength of the GCC’s green economy, where horticulture, landscape innovation and sustainable infrastructure are gaining increasing strategic relevance.

Senior representatives from across government, research institutions and global industry took part in the inaugural tour, including HE Lorenzo Fanara, Ambassador of Italy to the UAE; Andreas Kipar, member of the World Economic Forum Nature-Positive Cities Task Force and Chairman of Green City Italia; Francesco Santa, CEO of IEG Middle East; and Mirco Carloni, President of the XIII Commission (Agriculture) of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Their presence underscored the high level of international cooperation driving the region’s transition towards sustainable urban environments.

HE Dr. Mohammed Salman Alhammadi affirmed that ""Myplant & Garden Middle East 2025"" touches the core of the UAE's directives and strategic vision, stating: ""We believe that horticulture and the green sector play a major role in the urban planning of our sustainable cities and communities. Building smart, liveable, and climate-adaptive cities requires us to innovatively adopt 'Nature-based Solutions'"".

His Excellency added: ""Our vision transcends aesthetics to emphasise the strong relationship between green cities and food security. Through innovation in agricultural technologies and urban farming, we can transform our urban spaces into productive and sustainable ecosystems. This ambition cannot be achieved without collaboration, and international partnership is the key to success. We are pleased to see this strong momentum from our international partners in transferring expertise and the latest innovations to the region. This exhibition is a true platform for building partnerships and delivering practical solutions for future cities right here, from the land of the UAE.""

More than 100 exhibitors from around the world are showcasing cutting-edge solutions for arid-climate horticulture, sustainable irrigation, climate-adaptive plant production, outdoor and landscape design, and next-generation smart greenhouse technologies. These innovations respond directly to the environmental challenges facing the region, including water scarcity, high summer temperatures and the increasing need for desertification mitigation through strategic landscaping.

Across three days, the exhibition will host a diverse programme of conferences, expert roundtables and technical workshops that examine the region’s environmental priorities. Discussions will explore nature-positive urban planning, resilient plant production, water resource management, biodiversity restoration, climate-adaptive landscaping, and the integration of biophilic and circular design principles into the built environment. Specialists will also address how intelligent irrigation systems, native species cultivation and interconnected green corridors can transform cities into cooler, healthier and more liveable spaces.

The strong engagement from government bodies, research institutions and international stakeholders reinforces the importance of Myplant & Garden Middle East as a platform guiding future policy, institutional collaboration and investment in green infrastructure. The insights shared throughout the event reflect a growing regional commitment to integrating sustainable landscaping, public gardens and biodiversity-rich public spaces into major real-estate, tourism and urban development projects.

Valeria Randazzo, Exhibition Director of Myplant & Garden Middle East, noted that the conversations taking place during the exhibition will play a key role in shaping the trajectory of the region’s cities. “Green spaces are an essential component of a future-ready city. This exhibition brings global expertise and regional ambition together, accelerating pathways towards sustainable horticulture, advanced irrigation solutions and resilient landscape design. These conversations will shape the development of greener cities throughout the Middle East,” she said.

Day One concluded with a strong emphasis on the need to reimagine urban environments as nature-positive and climate-resilient spaces that support both environmental health and human wellbeing. Discussions highlighted how outdoor environments influence real-estate value, community cohesion and long-term sustainability, while also acknowledging the growing demand for greener developments across the GCC.

With its robust international participation, comprehensive technical agenda and the endorsement of leading government authorities, Myplant & Garden Middle East 2025 stands as a landmark event for the regional horticulture and landscaping sector. It sets the foundation for reshaping Middle Eastern cities into sustainable, biodiverse ecosystems that advance public wellbeing, drive investment and strengthen climate resilience for generations to come.

Doing so with renewable energy — along with so-called firming technologies — would be a cheaper option than maintaining the status quo, she said.
""Yes, renewable energy, once it is built and operational, is one of the lowest-cost sources of energy.
""This is the primary driver of new investment across the system, Ms van den Berg said.
""The most cost-effective and cleanest way to replace retiring coal plants remains renewables and storage, supported by gas for firming.""","Australia's energy chiefs have warned against the country turning away from its net zero ambitions, but cautioned that electricity prices are unlikely to fall for at least a decade.

In a survey of the bosses running the country's major energy companies, the Australian Energy Council found many were worried that unavoidable costs were yet to sheet home to consumers.

The council represents major power companies including AGL, Origin and Energy Australia.

Another told surveyors that costs for network poles and wires in particular were set to ""go up and go up by increasing levels"".

""And the Australian consumer is not really wise to that yet because they haven't seen the worst of it,"" the CEO noted.

Part of the cost of electricity comes from generating it, and increased renewables in Australia's electricity system have recently put downward pressure on electricity prices.

But the cost of delivering this electricity through maintaining and upgrading the electricity network has been increasing.

'Too late' to turn back

Despite these costs, many chief executives warned abandoning the energy transition was untenable given the ageing and increasingly unreliable nature of coal plants that had long formed the mainstay of the electricity system.

And they argued that renewable energy — backed by batteries, gas plants and pumped hydro — was still the ""least-cost"" way of replacing that coal.

""It's about making sure that we get the right assets on the ground in time for coal closure, in a nutshell,"" said one boss.

The release of the survey follows a tumultuous week in Canberra in which the opposition Liberal Party junked its support for net zero by 2050.

Louisa Kinnear, who runs the council, said her members ""understood the urgency of climate change and the role of the energy industry in meeting our emissions ambitions.""

She echoed their comments, particularly that many of Australia's coal-fired power stations were coming towards the end of their useful life and would soon need replacing anyway.

Doing so with renewable energy — along with so-called firming technologies — would be a cheaper option than maintaining the status quo, she said.

""The AEC supports the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 on the premise that the least-cost, lowest-impact pathway is an energy system dominated by renewables,"" Ms Kinnear said.

The CSIRO and international energy experts have consistently found that renewable energy supported by storage is the cheapest form of new power, a view backed up last week by the International Energy Agency, which found a scenario in which countries pushed for net zero by 2050 would leave consumers better off than a slower transition.

However, Ms Kinnear stressed that significant costs would be incurred in building new generation capacity, expanded transmission and distribution lines and back-up kit that would be required to support all of it.

Costs up 'for at least a decade'

Ms Kinnear said this would ultimately have an effect on consumers' bills.

And she said ensuring electricity remained affordable was a central challenge.

""We need to ensure that clean, affordable energy remains accessible to everyone during the transition,"" she said.

""Replacing ageing, emissions-intensive generation with predominantly renewable energy is not costless.

""Yes, renewable energy, once it is built and operational, is one of the lowest-cost sources of energy.

""But we still need to account for the costs of constructing new supply and adapting our existing energy system to accommodate and firm up low-emissions intermittent sources.""

Some chief executives, who were able to provide their comments anonymously, were more direct.

According to one, the ""most urgent issue, I think, is addressing affordability"".

Another said: ""The biggest risk to this whole transition is that the general public haven't really cottoned on to the fact that there's a cost to the transition, and power bills will go up for a while before they go down.""

Others worried the difficulties facing the transition, which have included ballooning construction costs, localised opposition to projects and a fractious political climate, were a serious risk to its progress.

There were also concerns that delays to the construction of new transmission lines and the large-scale wind and solar farms that depended on them would have knock-on effects for existing fossil fuel plants.

Some CEOs, the council noted, ""believe it is becoming increasingly inevitable that coal closures may need to be delayed”, risking increased unreliability, and often an injection of taxpayer funds for plants to stay open past their planned closure dates.

""The transition right now is delicately poised and at quite an important point,"" the head of a generation and retail company said.

""There have been these bumps along the way, it is taking longer to deliver the new generation and transmission projects [and] transmission is obviously a critical path.""

Energy Networks Australia, the lobby group which represents poles and wires companies, said attributing cost pressures in electricity supply to transmission projects was an oversimplification.

CEO Dominique van den Berg said there were lots of reasons prices in energy supply chains were rising, from interest rates to surging demand for labour and materials.

Ms van den Berg also pointed out that replacing ageing infrastructure was ""no longer optional"", it was ""essential"".

""This is the primary driver of new investment across the system, Ms van den Berg said.

""Even in this environment, transmission lines are still a relatively small share of a household bill.

The law was in full effect, mandating monitoring and handling of landfills, when the EPA conducted its Superfund site inspection in 1993.","Rain fell freely on Casper Riordan without a tree canopy to temper it.

In a clearing between the urban forests of Alton Baker Park and Eastgate Woodlands, he led a small crew of volunteers working within a tight radius marked by bright neon flags — the boundary of their restoration project.

It’s a tough place for Riordan, a stewardship coordinator with the Walama Restoration Project, to find the right plants for. Inside this nearly 2-mile loop of Pre’s Trail is the 70-acre decommissioned Day Island Landfill. About 2 feet of soil — the landfill’s cap — lie between a decade’s worth of garbage and the native species he is trying to grow.

The soil is too shallow for the roots of big trees to take hold, and so plants must endure full sun in the heat of summer. But they also have to be able to live in soft, waterlogged ground when rain returns each fall, as it had begun to do this October Sunday.

“It gets pretty wet down there. That’s more of a wet meadow,” said Riordan, referencing an area near the Interstate 5 bridge. “[There are] pools of water.”

Such pools are typically a natural part of the southern Willamette Valley’s wetlands. But here, some water may be rising from beneath an estimated 950,000 tons of buried solid waste.

Lookout Eugene-Springfield’s initial investigation into the Day Island Landfill identified a roughly 200-square-foot chemical disposal area, about the size of a small garage, that took in toxic waste from J.H. Baxter & Co. — the west Eugene wood-treatment company whose facility is now a Superfund cleanup site.

The Environmental Protection Agency, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and Lane County either have not monitored the landfill site for decades or can’t find records of such work since the early 1990s. They say they have no plans to resume the monitoring.

Government agencies pointed to the landfill’s cap as the protection against human exposure to what lies beneath. They also cited the 1993 decision not to designate the property as a Superfund site, which they said removed federal oversight of follow-up actions or other requirements.

But records stored for years in Washington, D.C., archives — and released to Lookout by the EPA, through the Freedom of Information Act — describe a complex situation.

The records detail contaminants have broken through the surface and that some may be leaking into a pond near the Willamette River, south of a monitoring well where chemicals used by J.H. Baxter were detected.

These records, including photographs, show a water-saturated landfill during the rainy months.

Landfill caps typically include an impermeable liner, none of which is noted in records. Instead, those records describe groundwater moving easily through loose, sandy soil and becoming trapped beneath the cap, forcing water to seep.

What pushes through likely contains leachate, the contaminated water that filters through decaying waste. Records contain photos of standing water, some of which displays an oily sheen with orange or reddish-brown clay.

After recent atmospheric rivers this fall, puddles have lingered for days, their contents unknown, alongside a nearby pond showing similar discoloration as the records described decades ago.

These records also outline the EPA’s rationale for not listing the landfill as a Superfund site. But in a decision memo, the site’s lead investigator, Deborah Flood, did not dismiss concerns. She wrote:

“Information collected identifies (Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality) as an active authority on the site … The site does have environmental problems associated with it; however, it does not qualify for further Superfund evaluation.”

Superfund sites represent only the most extreme contamination cases. Fewer than 1% of known toxic sites in the country qualify. Many hazardous sites fall below that threshold, and this landfill was one of those.

A ‘secondary’ Superfund site

In 1991, then-U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio wrote to the EPA on behalf of a constituent.

“[They are] concerned about the proposed construction of a golf course on a closed Lane County Landfill that is currently listed on the EPA’s secondary list of Superfund sites,” DeFazio wrote in a memo.

“Secondary” is not a formal EPA term, but it can refer to a site listed for investigation under the Superfund law, as the Day Island Landfill was in 1979. The EPA became involved after allegations that Monsanto Co., the maker of Roundup, dumped waste there.

In response to DeFazio’s letter, an EPA administrator outlined the situation, saying the agency found contaminants beneath surface soil and surface water and planned to score the site under a new ranking system.

In 1993, the site received a score of 25.09, below the 28.5 threshold required for Superfund designation. By comparison, the J.H. Baxter wood-treatment plant in west Eugene scored 31.7 and received its Superfund designation earlier this year. The scorecard considers how close people live to a site, but it does not account for heavy public use of surrounding parkland, focusing instead on residential proximity.

A 1992 study commissioned by Oregon’s DEQ, which helped inform the scoring, found no evidence of dumping by Monsanto.

But investigators uncovered records linking about 1,400 gallons of oily waste from J.H. Baxter’s wood-preserving plant to the landfill and detected pentachlorophenol at levels above federal drinking-water standards. Pentachlorophenol is a highly toxic, manmade substance that doesn’t break down easily.

It’s why the Superfund program and its ranking system do not clear a site of risk. Instead, they try to document what the risks might be at any particular site.

Leachate likely in standing water

An April 1993 EPA memo summarizing the site inspection said “groundwater was characterized as extremely variable and inconsistent” and recapped its findings from the 1984 assessment and another assessment in 1992 commissioned by DEQ.

Potential leachate was tracked during landfill operations in the 1970s through 23 monitoring wells, but the wells were so poorly constructed that they produced inconsistent, inconclusive data.

The EPA determined that earlier groundwater studies were insufficient and concluded the landfill’s waste was periodically saturated with groundwater.

A new water quality assessment — part of the 1992 assessments — showed that a nearby pond, between the former KEED radio station site and the Willamette River, likely had leachate in its water. This is different from the pond, also called the boat basin, connected to Patterson Slough north of the landfill, though assessments found poor water quality with signs of seeping from buried waste.

Samples from the small pond with possible leachate showed low levels of the metals arsenic and barium, which at high concentrations can affect the heart and nervous system.

Potential sources of the arsenic included herbicide and fungicide formulations as well as wood-preservative products, according to the assessment. The pond is near a monitoring well where tests found pentachlorophenol.

Nearby riverbanks, where water may have been discharging, were stained reddish-brown with a sheen in a small cove. Both the pond and standing water throughout the meadow had a film described as “orange scum.”

The discoloration was visible enough to prompt complaints, including the one raised with DeFazio. But because the landfill did not meet the Superfund threshold, the EPA was no longer involved and could only pass recommendations to state and county officials.

EPA administrator Dana Rasmussen wrote to DeFazio:

“Although the EPA does not have authority to take legal action against parties that may violate current federal solid land disposal criteria, they may be enforced in federal district court through the citizens’ suit provision of Section 7002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.”

Regulatory requirements

While similar to Superfund, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is a separate law with a different purpose. Superfund focuses on cleaning up and redeveloping contaminated sites, while the latter governs how hazardous waste is handled and monitored.

Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 1976, two years after the Day Island Landfill closed. The law was in full effect, mandating monitoring and handling of landfills, when the EPA conducted its Superfund site inspection in 1993. But records do not show whether the landfill’s legal compliance under the law, referred to as RCRA, was discussed during that time.

DEQ added the Day Island Landfill to the state’s list of contaminated properties in 1992, a designation meant to prompt Lane County, the responsible agency for the landfill, to take action. Along with the listing, DEQ sent conclusions and recommendations including details:

“The DEQ has determined that on-going ground water monitoring and landfill cap remediation will be necessary.”

“Further action is needed to evaluate the potential for off-site migration of contaminants to ground water and surface water.”

“Sediment from the pond with the reddish-orange staining should be sampled seasonally.”

If monitoring had shown hazardous releases that posed risks to health or the environment, it could have triggered action under hazardous-waste laws like RCRA. But Lane County can’t find the records that show if this monitoring happened.

In an email to Lookout, Lane County spokesperson Devon Ashbridge wrote, “Without a complete record, we can’t definitively answer your question about possible follow up that happened after the 1992 report.” She also said “no requirements related to RCRA were imposed in those reports.”

DEQ still lists the landfill as a “suspect” site and has not issued a final clearance letter or reviewed the property in more than 25 years. Spokesperson Dylan Darling said further action would require Lane County to enter DEQ’s Voluntary Cleanup Program, which the county has no plans to do, citing what it calls a lack of compelling new evidence.

An incomplete picture

Researchers who work at the intersection of natural and social environments such as Kyle Buck say monitoring should occur not just because the law requires it, but because, in cases like Pre’s Trail, the picture remains incomplete.

Buck is an environmental professor at the University of Vermont and served nearly 10 years at the EPA as a research geographer. Although he has not studied the Day Island Landfill and could not speak to it specifically, he offered broader observations.

He echoed other researchers’ concerns about “known unknowns.” In other words, what is known — that toxic contaminants are present — is overshadowed by what remains unknown: what those contaminants mean for human health today. For example, the pond near Willamette River likely containing leachate still exists today, but it isn’t known how conditions have changed or stayed the same.

“Based on the chemicals there, I would be very concerned about any kind of water contamination,” Buck said. “This [landfill] is from the ’70s, so there is definitely no liner underneath, so things could be leaching down.”

Beneath the landfill is an aquifer, like a subterranean lake, that runs parallel to the Willamette River, tied into the region’s interconnected groundwater system.

In 1993, the EPA warned that contamination from the landfill could migrate through the groundwater system toward nearly 187 private and municipal wells serving more than 10,000 people through the Rainbow Water District.

Investigators did not find evidence of contamination reaching municipal wells at the time. And district leadership — which still contracts with the Springfield Utility Board to supply customers in areas west and north of the city — says their hydrology models show water from the landfill is not being drawn into its wells today.

Monitoring systems and liners help track and control how water can move through a landfill and limit future migration of contaminants. It’s why such landfill management is now required by laws like RCRA, Buck said.

Instead, the landfill raises questions that many in the community share — including Buck. Though he lives across the country, Buck, a cross-country coach, has visited Eugene and run on Pre’s Trail himself.

It is a landmark that runners and residents helped build after Steve Prefontaine’s death in 1975, fulfilling his vision for Scandinavian-style bark trails.

“Pre’s Trail is a big thing,” Buck said. “If you’re close to it and you’re a runner, you got to go, right?”

Community response

The Whilamut Citizen Planning Committee — a joint body created by the Eugene City Council and the Willamalane Park and Recreation District — has met quarterly since the early 1990s to guide stewardship and planning in the Whilamut Natural Area, which includes Pre’s Trail.

The committee had raised questions about the landfill before, and it’s back on their agenda.

At the committee’s fall meeting in October, held inside a yurt at Alton Baker Park, longtime members including David Sonnichsen had printed copies of Lookout’s first investigation into Pre’s Trail.

He knew there was a chemical deposit site in the landfill, but said that J.H. Baxter was never named in any of the documents he came across.

“The [committee] is the natural vehicle for raising an issue just like this. I felt like it was incumbent that we respond,” Sonnichsen said.

The committee is planning a meeting in November or December to discuss a letter to the city and county with concerns and requests. Meanwhile, people use the area almost constantly — for everything from international athletic championships to local stewardship projects like Riordan’s.

Before kneeling to plant a native Idaho blue-eyed grass, Riordan said he hasn’t seen the orange ooze himself. When he’s there, things are usually dried out. Still, he knows the history beneath his feet — the traces of a disturbed landscape — and how small acts of care like his can begin to change it.

“It can be hard to look at it and feel like it’s making a difference,” he said. “But just in the couple of years I’ve been working at the site, it’s completely different.”

In this patch, unlike others still overtaken by weeds, new green shoots pushed through, no pools of water around. Riordan tipped a plastic bin, roots dangling, and pressed them gently into the wet soil.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3806-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-16 11:05:03.474239

The movie “Network” is 50 years old, but the iconic sentiment, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore” is common. Households and sole-proprietor businesses like farmers see price-fixing and similar collusion all around them. They are “mad as hell,” but it is up to Congress if they will “have to take it.”

Despite President Donald Trump’s assertions that grocery prices are down, the last consumer price index showed that “food eaten at home is up 1.6%” since he took office and 5.5% over a year earlier. Turkey is up 25% over the last year. “Meat, fish and poultry” is up 5.2% from a year ago, with 2.2% of that between Inauguration Day and September.

Ground beef, a mainstay for many, was up 11.5% over 12 months and 14% since January. No, that’s not a mistake. The price fell from September to January but then bounced back up. Thus many consumers are mad as hell.

So farmers also are angry. Despite Trump saying the Chinese had promised to buy 12 million tons of soybeans this year, none have moved. Yet prices of inputs for 2026, especially fertilizer, are high relative to prospective crop prices.

Beef is one bright sector. Slaughter cattle prices are near record highs. Breeding herds are recovering after shrinking numbers during a decade of drought. But operations fattening cattle say that the gap between what they receive from packing plants and what consumers pay is widening further.

Members of Congress from farm states listen to their constituents. There are hearings on why fertilizer prices are so high. Others question why meat packers, both for beef and pork, seem to have growing market power allowing them to grab a larger share of profits. Members of key committees are speaking out and introducing legislation to fix problems.

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, is a key one speaking up on both issues. With a farm background, he has represented Iowa in Congress for a half-century following 16 years in the Iowa Legislature. Thus, when he challenges monopolistic abuses that raise farm input costs and lower farm product prices, he speaks from some authority. But in his condemnations, he misses a key variable – what Congress has done in the decades Grassley himself has been in Washington. That is nearly nothing.

Grassley’s degrees, a B.A., M.A. and most of a Ph.D., all are in political science. So he probably never learned a key incident in Spanish history that fits him and his congressional colleagues to a tee.

Islamic Moors occupied Spain for centuries, but were driven out in the 1400s. In 1492, they gave up their last holdout, the city of Granada and its stunningly beautiful Alhambra palace. As the surrendering Moorish king rode away, he looked back and shed a tear at what was lost. His harsh mother was pitiless: “You do well to weep like a woman for what you would not defend like a man!”

That is precisely what Congress needs to hear now. Why stage great street theater about monopolies raising meat and fertilizer prices in 2025 when successive Congresses and presidents did nothing to stop their growth since the early 1980s? In 1980, the biggest four beef packers had 38% of the total market. By 2020, it was 82%. Yet history shows it is easier to prevent monopolies from being created than to break them up after they become entrenched.

Moreover, while both parties have blame, in recent decades the GOP has been far more cozy with monopoly power than the Democrats. This is a shame, given that antitrust was a central issue for the Republican Party before World War I. Teddy Roosevelt was the greatest “trust buster” of all time. After Abraham Lincoln, Teddy was the greatest GOP president ever. He dared to call out “malefactors of great wealth,” something no one in either party will do today.

To better understand all this, review some basic microeconomics.

“Perfect competition” has many small producers, none of whom have any power to set prices. Every seller is a price taker in a market with many buyers.

Monopoly is the opposite. There is only one producer who, facing no competition, sets prices wherever they want. They choose a quantity and price giving the greatest profit. That is visible to disadvantaged buyers right now, whether purchasing beef roasts or ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

Abusively high prices are not the only problem. The quantity of output produced is smaller than what is optimal for society as a whole. Resources are used inefficiently. Greater quantities of resources are used up to produce one unit of product than would be in a competitive market. Finally, monopolies foster less innovation. Without the stimulus of having to compete with other producers, there is little reason to look for ways to do things better.

Understand there are few real-world examples of perfect competition and few of pure monopoly. At the first end, there is “monopolistic competition” in which some but not all of the conditions for pure competition exist. At the other, there is oligopoly. Just as “oligarchy” is rule by a few people instead of one person in a monarchy, so oligopoly is a market with only a few producers who compete little.

Most large sectors – airliners, steel, automobiles, motor fuels, locomotives, chemicals – are oligopolies. So are meats and several other food categories. So are fertilizer, seeds and farm chemicals.

When there are only a few producers, the danger for society is that these combine, agreeing to conduct their business as if they jointly are a monopoly. Such collusion is what angry senators are investigating right now. It is what Teddy Roosevelt fought 120 years ago. It was the heart of the 1903 Northern Securities Co. decision from the Supreme Court that broke up a three-railroad “trust” put together by St. Paul’s own James J. Hill.

Curbing monopoly power long was important to Republicans. Richard Nixon saw it was time to break up the regulated monopolies in telecommunications. His Democratic successor, Jimmy Carter, did the same for airlines, railroads and trucking, reforms that were finished by Republican Ronald Reagan.

But that changed with the new century. Democrat Bill Clinton’s Justice Department saw anti-competitive practices by Microsoft. It filed suit to break Microsoft into two companies – one for operating systems and another for applications, just as Standard Oil and International Harvester had been broken up a century earlier. In 2000, the government was clearly winning the case in court, but as soon as George W. Bush was inaugurated, the case was dropped.

That was the turn of the tide of any GOP antitrust action. With the 2010 Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court that legalized payoffs to politicians, anti-competitive collusion and price-fixing was given a free hand. Congress has stood by. They can hold all the hearings they want and pass all the bills calling for further study they want. But unless the president in the Oval Office and majorities in the House and Senate agree to promote competition, citizens should not expect much.

The Washington Informer

https://www.washingtoninformer.com/

As a faith leader in our city, I am deeply committed to the well-being of both my congregation at Holy Trinity United Baptist Church and the wider community. Every day, I hear from my congregants who are struggling under the weight of rising costs, and who are worried about the future of their city. From grocery prices to housing, the steep cost of living and economic uncertainty for the future of the District is making residents worried about how they’re going to afford their daily expenses and put food on the table.

That is why I am concerned about the proposed D.C. Bottle Bill, which would add yet another cost to the daily lives of our residents and is the last thing we should be focusing on right now. This policy, while well-intentioned, would increase the price of almost all everyday beverages at a time when families simply cannot afford higher prices, especially at the grocery store.

This proposal also comes with logistical challenges that disproportionately affect low-income families and seniors. To recover the deposit, these folks would need to return their bottles and cans to designated sites. That’s a burden for those who may not have access to reliable transportation. For our seniors, many of whom live on fixed incomes and face mobility challenges, this system could mean losing money on every purchase.

The bill would also create significant financial burdens for small businesses that provide reliable jobs and meaningful connections for so many. These businesses are already struggling, from decreased patronage, difficulty retaining workers, to the lasting impacts of inflation, the pandemic and shifting customer habits in recent years, all on top of thin operating margins. They now face the prospect of new costs and administrative hurdles associated with this recycling program. This is really too much to ask. This bill would force them to make room for returned bottles and cans, devote staff resources to handle these new tasks and potentially increase prices on their customers.

As people of faith, we are called to care about our environment and be good stewards of our natural resources to make sure that our parks, rivers and public spaces can be enjoyed by future generations. We are also called to stand up for the city and families who we love. There must be a path forward of balance and fairness that does not make it harder for families and residents in the District who are struggling — and the city as a whole.

The D.C. Council has an obligation to hear these voices and reconsider this costly and burdensome proposal. We can come together to work toward a better solution — one that protects the environment and the well-being of the people and businesses in our community — but now is simply not the time.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren’t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action — on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more — including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Decision time

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad it could be.”

Momentum to phase out fossil fuels

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Getting Indigenous voices heard

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,” said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you’re trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn’t make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

“And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people’s behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. “Most people don’t even realize they’re there.”

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they’re protesting or backing. If you like what they’re doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn’t much you can do about it. “I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,” he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.
United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.
Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.
“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren’t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on “implementation” of past promises not yet kept.

Throw that out the window.

The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action — on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more — including from Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva — the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he’ll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqué, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.

“I think things have changed, which is a very good thing,” said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. “So I think there’s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there’s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.”

“I would say that what’s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you’re looking at an ambition gap,″ said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. “There’s a lot of expectation, there’s a lot of excitement here, but there’s also a lot of political signals that’s been sent by President Lula.”

“We’re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It’s almost like a staring contest,” Inventor said. “But next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.”

Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.

Decision time

Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.

In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn’t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth’s warming.

Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.

So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what’s planned in national pledges and what’s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.

That’s not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year’s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.

So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.

On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.

“The parties will decide how they want to proceed,” do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.

In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: “Eh, could be better but not as bad as it could be.”

Momentum to phase out fossil fuels

U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister who has been to 10 of these sessions, told The Associated Press Saturday morning before the evening’s session that she saw “new momentum” in Belem.

“We can fight the climate crisis only together if we commit to a strong mitigation target,” she said. “This means also transitioning away from fossil fuels, investing into renewable energy.”

Two years ago in Dubai, the world agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels,” but last year no mention of that was made and there’ve been no details on how or when to do this.

Baerbock hailed as crucial Lula’s call during the Leaders’ Summit last week for “a road map for humanity to overcome, in a just and planned way, its dependence on fossil fuels, reverse deforestation, and mobilize the resources needed to do so.”

“I think what we have before us are the ingredients of a potential high-ambition package for the outcome of this conference,” Iskander Erzini Vernoit, executive director of the Moroccan IMAL Initiative for Climate and Development, said.

Getting Indigenous voices heard

Indigenous groups breached and blockaded the venue twice this week with demands to be further included in the U.N. talks, despite this conference’s promotion as the “Indigenous Peoples’ COP.”

The COP so far “was a testament that unfortunately, for Indigenous peoples to be heard, they actually need to be disruptive,” said Aya Khourshid, an Egyptian-Palestinian member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a group of Indigenous people from around the world.

Indigenous people are putting a lot of energy “to be in this space but to not necessarily be given a platform or voice at the decision table with the ministers and those who are in power,” said Whaia, a Ngāti Kahungunu Wisdom Keeper.

“There’s an imbalance here at COP30,” she said. “There’s the privileged and the not-so lucky who don’t get a say on what’s actually going on in their own home.”

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500 million a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state's “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency's air-pollution-fighting ""good neighbor"" rule.

___

This story has been updated to correct that one of the laws requires disclosures from companies that make more than $500 million a year, not more than $500,000 a year.

The Innovation and Prosperity Report prepared by the Innovation and Productivity Taskforce (IPT), identifies that prosperity flows to jurisdictions that own intellectual property, data and AI models. Manitoba now has the opportunity to turn strategy into measurable economic growth. Premier Kinew’s vision of making Manitoba a “Have Province by 2040” demands a laser focus on the only metric that reflects real lived prosperity: GDP per capita.

1. Intangible Asset Ownership

IP, data, and AI cannot sit in separate silos as they form a single system of economic value. In the modern economy, prosperity is based on ownership of intangible assets — patents, data, AI models that generate high-margin value. By merging Intellectual Property and Data & AI into one unified “Intangible Asset Ownership” pillar ensures Manitoba governs, commercializes, and retains its intellectual capital through a single strategic lens. When Manitoba owns the ideas created within its jurisdiction, it captures economic rents that directly raise GDP per capita.

The Federal Budget 2025 allocates $925.6 million for AI infrastructure and additional funds for renewed IP programs. Manitoba is uniquely positioned to host a green sovereign compute hub powered by Manitoba Hydro enabling the province to control both the compute infrastructure and the IP layer to boosts productivity per worker keeping innovation value at home.

2. Commercialization and Capital Formation

Manitoba does not lack ideas; it lacks the capital to scale them. Early-stage companies lack the capital and procurement pathways required to reach global markets. A “Commercialization and Capital Formation” pillar would change this. A Manitoba Sovereign Innovation Fund (MSIF) co-investing with federal programs like the $1.75-billion Venture and Growth Capital Catalyst Initiative (VGCCI) and early-stage startups provide the financing needed to turn Manitoba-based startups into globally competitive firms. Mobilizing Manitoba’s pension funds and credit unions as patient capital partners would strengthen this pipeline. Combined with the federal Buy Canadian procurement strategy, Manitoba can ensure public investment fuels Manitoba-owned technology firms keeping IP, jobs, and tax revenues in-province.

The economic impact is immediate driving high productivity gains, creating high-value jobs, and generating strong tax base growth. This is the fastest lever to lift GDP per capita.

3. Infrastructure and Clean-Energy Trade Corridors

Manitoba’s infrastructure advantage is global. A unified “Infrastructure and Clean-Energy Trade Corridors” pillar reframes Churchill, the Hudson Bay Railway, CentrePort, transmission lines, and province-wide fibre as one integrated strategy tied directly to global markets. With the federal government investing heavily in Arctic infrastructure, defence, and critical minerals processing, Manitoba can position Churchill as a dual-use economic and security corridor, central to Canada’s northern sovereignty. Every infrastructure investment installed through this corridor reduces costs, expands market access, and boosts productivity across agriculture, clean hydrogen, critical minerals, digital services, and manufacturing. Manitoba has the potential to become the clean-energy and digital trade hub of Canada.

4. Skills, Talent and Enterprise Scale-Up

Skills matter but skills that scale firms matter more. Manitoba must tie talent development directly to enterprise growth and technology adoption. Expanding micro-credentials, university-industry co-ops, and rapid re-skilling programs in AI, hydrogen operations, and advanced manufacturing will ensure Manitoba develops and retains the talent required for a knowledge economy. A ‘Made-in-Manitoba PNP’ immigration program for founders, AI specialists, and technical experts would complement these efforts. When talent development is tied directly to enterprise expansion and scale-ups, Manitoba raises labor productivity and ensures its workforce drives economic transformation.

5. Sector Strategy and Global Integration

Manitoba must focus where it has global advantage: agri-value, critical minerals processing, clean hydrogen, digital infrastructure, and northern trade. A coordinated “Sector Strategy & Global Integration” pillar would align export development, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) attraction, and procurement around these sectors. Churchill’s global shipping reach can amplify this strategy by opening northern routes for hydrogen, critical minerals, and agri-food exports while strengthening Manitoba’s position in global supply chains. With a coherent sector strategy, Manitoba shifts from exporting raw goods to exporting high-value finished products and digital services raising value capture per worker and driving GDP per capita upward.

Cross-Cutting Enablers

Manitoba’s transformation requires three enablers that operate across all pillars. Federal–Provincial Alignment is essential enabler. Budget 2025 is the most innovation-focused budget in Canadian history. Manitoba must act quickly on joint proposals, co-funding opportunities, and long-term federal partnerships to secure its share.

Indigenous Partnership and Inclusion is another enabler. Indigenous Nations should be engaged as full partners and co-owners in infrastructure, clean-energy corridors, and innovation projects. This is reconciliation in action and smart economics.

Data-Driven Measurement and Accountability must guide every initiative. Manitoba needs a Innovation Dashboard that tracks productivity growth, export expansion, IP retention, firm scaling, and GDP per capita impact. What gets measured, gets improved.

The Path Forward

Manitoba has unmatched clean energy, a strategic Arctic gateway, strong tech ecosystem, and bold leadership willing to think generationally. The Innovation Blueprint offers a clear, actionable path to transform momentum into lasting prosperity. By owning ideas, scaling innovators, building clean-energy trade corridors, empowering talent, and aligning strategic sectors with global demand, Manitoba can lift its GDP per capita above the national average and become a “Have Province by 2040”.

Paraguay is strategically leveraging its vast reserves of clean, abundant hydropower to carve out a unique niche for itself as a premier technology hub in South America. By offering some of the lowest energy costs on the continent, the government is actively promoting the nation as a sustainable and highly affordable destination for international tech investments, particularly for energy-intensive sectors like data centers and artificial intelligence companies.

The Hydropower Advantage: A Foundation for the Paraguay tech hub

The cornerstone of Paraguay’s ambitious plan is its formidable energy infrastructure. The country relies almost entirely on hydroelectric power, with the massive Itaipu Dam alone providing approximately 90% of its electricity. This not only makes Paraguay the world’s leading exporter of clean energy but also creates a significant surplus of affordable, renewable electricity. This powerful combination is exceptionally attractive for industries where energy consumption is a primary operational cost, such as AI processing facilities and large-scale data centers.

While hydropower is the dominant force, the country is also beginning to diversify its renewable portfolio. The current Paraguay Solar Production Report shows a modest but growing solar capacity, signaling an awareness of the need for a more resilient and varied energy grid to support its long-term goals.

Government-Led Strategy for a Digital Future in the Paraguay tech hub

Under the leadership of President Santiago Pena, the Paraguayan government is taking decisive steps to transform this energy advantage into tangible economic growth. The administration is actively engaging with major Silicon Valley companies to attract investment and foster a vibrant tech ecosystem.

A central element of this strategy is the development of a $20 million digital park near Asunción’s international airport. This hub is designed to stimulate private investment and create a collaborative environment where academia, local businesses, and international tech firms can innovate together. This initiative is further bolstered by Paraguay’s young population, which represents a growing pool of human capital ready to be trained for the digital economy.

Beyond Tech: Building a Diverse Economic Ecosystem in the Paraguay tech hub

Paraguay’s push into technology aligns with its broader economic development goals, which include expanding its successful “Maquila” manufacturing sector and improving regional connectivity. This creates a compelling environment for other industries, including renewable energy manufacturing. With its low energy costs and strategic location, investors are exploring the feasibility of establishing a Paraguay Solar Factory: Choosing Asunción or Ciudad del ….

Setting up such an operation requires a deep understanding of the basics of manufacturing and the complete manufacturing process. Success hinges on efficiently sourcing the necessary raw materials, procuring the right manufacturing machines, and carefully managing a detailed plant cost breakdown.

A Regional Perspective on Renewable Energy and the Paraguay tech hub

Paraguay’s strategy does not exist in a vacuum; it is part of a larger trend across South America where nations are leveraging their unique strengths to attract investment. International investors often consult a Global Solar Report to compare opportunities across the continent. Neighboring countries offer different models within the Mercosur trade bloc; for example, establishing a Brazil Solar Factory: A Strategic Guide to the Mercosur … provides access to a massive domestic market, while Solar Manufacturing in Uruguay’s Free Trade Zones: A Guide presents a compelling case for export-focused businesses.

In summary, Paraguay’s combination of cheap, clean hydroelectric power, proactive government support, and a developing workforce creates a powerful foundation for its ambition to become South America’s premier technology hub, powered entirely by clean energy.

“For decades, Delaware was known for predictable court outcomes, respect for the judgment of corporate boards, and speedy resolutions,” Grewal wrote.
“But no more.” Coinbase’s departure is particularly notable because no other major company — tech or otherwise — has recently chosen to leave Delaware for another jurisdiction.
“This choice is much bigger than Coinbase,” Grewal wrote.","In a move that reverberated across corporate and legal circles this week, Coinbase — the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange — announced that it will formally leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas.

The decision, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, was accompanied by a sharply worded Wall Street Journal opinion piece from Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, who argued that Delaware’s once-gold-standard legal environment has devolved into an unpredictable arena driven by activist rulings and inconsistent outcomes.

The announcement marks a dramatic turn for Delaware, long regarded as the corporate capital of America.

More than a million U.S. companies generate more than a billion dollars annually in fees and associated economic activity.

But Grewal contends that the legal environment underpinning that long-standing relationship has eroded.

“For decades, Delaware was known for predictable court outcomes, respect for the judgment of corporate boards, and speedy resolutions,” Grewal wrote. “But no more.”

Coinbase’s departure is particularly notable because no other major company — tech or otherwise — has recently chosen to leave Delaware for another jurisdiction. In that sense, the crypto exchange is an outlier, though one that is seeking to position itself at the forefront of what it sees as a shifting national landscape for corporate governance.

Grewal argues that Delaware’s famed Court of Chancery, once regarded as the most sophisticated business court in the nation, has in recent years issued rulings that companies view as inconsistent, activist, or overly interventionist.

He notes that lawmakers in Dover have repeatedly attempted to patch over judicial surprises with ad hoc legislation — a stopgap solution that Coinbase believes is no longer sufficient.

The concerns, he suggests, go beyond the crypto sector.

In the past two years, Delaware has seen a spate of record-setting defamation and damages awards against corporations — verdicts that, while not involving Coinbase directly, have raised alarm among executives and corporate boards about escalating legal exposure in the state.

Many top companies have left Delaware or announced plans to do so, including the nation’s largest mall owner, Simon Property Group; retailer Dillard’s; Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management; venture firm Andreessen Horowitz; online retailer Mercado Libre; Roblox; Tripadvisor; Affirm; AMC cable networks; Madison Square Garden; President Donald Trump’s Trump Media; and Dropbox, among others.

Coinbase’s move to Texas reflects a growing effort by states to compete for corporate domiciles by offering streamlined regulations and predictable legal frameworks.

Texas, in particular, has taken steps in recent years to cultivate a business-friendly judicial ecosystem.

Grewal points to Senate Bill 29, a major reform that modernizes the Texas Business Organizations Code and codifies the business-judgment rule — long considered a pillar of deference to corporate decision-making.

Combined with the launch of the Texas Business Court system, these reforms give companies strong assurances about governance flexibility and the fair, efficient resolution of disputes.

Grewal wrote: “We believe we can drive forward our mission rapidly if given fair conditions. Our decision to leave is about ensuring more predictable opportunities for the company, our shareholders, our customers and the new on-chain ecosystem we’re building.”

While Delaware has dominated the incorporation landscape for decades, its reign is not inevitable.

“This choice is much bigger than Coinbase,” Grewal wrote. “It’s part of a movement of businesses choosing markets with favorable regulatory and judicial-review systems.”

“Copper, they say, is the next petroleum,” said Thyana Alvarez, Colombia vice president of Copper Giant, owner of the Mocoa project.
Copper Giant is committed to best practices of environmental stewardship and hiring locals, Alvarez said.
Around Mocoa, Copper Giant’s claims include several sacred sites, according to a statement issued by seven local Indigenous organizations this year.
That’s why Copper Giant works through the traditional social structures to provide in-kind support for customary activities, like communal work days, Vargas said.","MOCOA, Colombia—This isn’t the first time foreigners have shown up here, where the Andes Mountains meet the Amazon rainforest, insisting they needed what was under the ground.

First it was gold, recalled Zuly Rivera, a youth coordinator for the Nasa pueblo, one of several Indigenous groups that inhabit this densely forested region of southwestern Colombia. Then, it was oil. Now, as civilization’s appetite for energy evolves, a Canadian startup is prospecting for copper.

Advocates for copper mining here promise economic advancement, a new generation of responsible industry and a global transition to cleaner forms of power. But Rivera, who has stern eyes and long, black hair, senses a familiar story that is centuries old.

“They come to rob us,” she said. “For more than 500 years they have robbed us and today they continue.”

The daughter of social leaders and an administrator for her community’s territorial defense unit, Rivera is part of an activist network called Guardians of Andino-Amazonia that wants to prevent the development of a mine in the mountains above Mocoa, a small Colombian city surrounded by Indigenous reservations.

The Mocoa project by Vancouver-based Copper Giant, still in an early stage of exploration, is one of hundreds of potential copper mines advancing worldwide as part of a global rush to dig up metals for electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar farms and the data centers powering artificial intelligence. Most of these projects affect lands of Indigenous peoples, research shows.

Far from Mocoa, throughout the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, almost a dozen copper projects are in exploration or development, including three on the western edge of the Amazon Basin, where an accident or disaster could spill mine waste into one of the world’s most important and threatened ecosystems.

In the far eastern Amazon, more than 2,000 miles away, Indigenous protesters stormed into the 30th United Nations conference on climate change last week in the Brazilian city of Belém, decrying the ongoing destruction of Amazonian lands. World leaders are gathered there through Friday, considering what to do about a dangerously warming planet. Decades of discussions haven’t stopped the growth of global fossil fuel production or carbon emissions.

Now, amid surging energy demand from wealthy nations, the material needs of technologies meant to replace fossil fuels are fomenting their own wave of environmental threats.

Rivera, 34, gazed from a muddy ridge across the valley where Mocoa, founded in 1551, sits beside its namesake river, nestled between green, misty slopes. It’s not the copper she cares about losing, Rivera said. It’s the spirit of this place. She worries new roads through the jungle, new money in politics and an influx of new residents will eventually transform Mocoa from a secluded enclave of Indigenous cultures into a busy mining town.

“People from outside don’t know the value this has,” she said, waving her hand across the landscape. “For them, it is just a mountain.”

Surging Demand for Copper

Similar tensions are mounting around the world. A Norwegian copper mine in the Arctic faces opposition from Sami herders, and in western Canada the Tahltan Nation has denounced its exclusion from planning for two copper projects in its territory. A copper mine expansion in the Democratic Republic of Congo led to forced eviction of local villages and police crackdowns on protesters, while the U.S. Supreme Court, in October, cleared the way for an Arizona copper mine that will destroy sites sacred to the Apache.

These projects are fueled by billions of dollars from investors and governments aimed at producing materials for high tech manufacturing, and they want copper more than any other metal.

Copper forms the core of electric motors and turbine generators. It makes electrical cables, wires and circuit board pathways. A large solar farm uses hundreds of tons, according to the Copper Development Association, an industry group. A large data center for artificial intelligence uses tens of thousands of tons.

Demand for copper is expected to surge by 24 percent over the next decade, said the market intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie in an October report. Getting there will require building dozens of new mines at a breakneck pace.

“Copper, they say, is the next petroleum,” said Thyana Alvarez, Colombia vice president of Copper Giant, owner of the Mocoa project.

Alvarez, the daughter of a mine engineer, knows about this region’s bad experience with petroleum. Since the 1970s, oil companies have brought outsiders, pollution, deforestation and paramilitary violence with unrealized promises of community development.

Copper doesn’t have to be this way, Alvarez said. It presents “an opportunity to not repeat the errors that others committed.”

For the last four years, Copper Giant has donated to schools, churches, sports teams, communities and colleges in Mocoa and beyond trying to foster a consensus around the project, Alvarez said. The company is building a highway bridge over the Mocoa River, a smaller bridge at a rural community inside its claims and a new road for heavy vehicles between them. Copper Giant is committed to best practices of environmental stewardship and hiring locals, Alvarez said.

The company, however, can’t speak to specifics of a potential mine, still years away. Copper Giant is just an exploration firm—an investor-funded enterprise that acquires and develops mineral reserves with hopes of selling them to a much larger mining company. So, Alvarez can’t say if it would be a surface mine that scrapes away landscapes, or an underground mine that taps deposits through shafts. It would probably be an underground mine, she said.

“A New Chapter”

Copper has stirred excitement in Colombian business and politics. Alvarez, whose father worked his career at the country’s largest coal mine, was named one of Colombia’s most influential women of 2025 by Semana magazine for her leadership in emerging industries and the energy transition.

Currently Colombia’s top exports are oil, coal and black-market cocaine. But the metallic deposits in its Andes Mountains formed in the same way as deposits in the Andes of Chile, the world’s top copper mining country, suggesting high production potential.

“We are opening a new chapter,” Álvaro Pardo, head of Colombia’s National Mining Agency, told the market intelligence service ChemAnalyst at a conference in March, where he announced auctions of 17 new copper leases. “It’s about securing our infrastructure, powering our green energy transition, and establishing Colombia as a self-sufficient copper producer.”

In the mountains above Mocoa, Copper Giant studies from 2022 estimate the company’s claims held 2.3 million tons of copper—enough to run high-power industrial wires around the Earth 96 times. This year, Copper Giant changed its name, previously Libero Cobre, to reflect its “belief that Mocoa is not simply a deposit, but potentially part of a much larger, district-scale copper system,” an announcement said. Two months later it expanded its mining claims by 64 percent to span nearly 340,000 acres.

“We’re building the technical foundation for the next phase of Mocoa’s growth,” said Copper Giant CEO Ian Harris in a press release last month.

The buzz has made locals nervous. The environmental group Guardians of Andino-Amazonia, founded in 2022, has organized festivals, hosted forums, visited schools and produced theater performances to raise awareness about what’s at stake if mining commences in the mountains where several rivers originate.

“People need to know more,” said Sirley Cely, a member of the group and Mocoa chapter vice president of Colombia’s Community Action Boards, a national civic organization. “The copper will go to sustain the lifestyles of the Northern countries, as always, but at the cost of wellbeing in the Southern countries.”

Cely, 43, lives 15 minutes outside Mocoa’s urban center, down a muddy road in a forested hamlet with five wooden houses surrounded by palm thickets, native fruits, giant ferns and mossy trees that twinkle with colorful birds. She planted many of these, she said, strolling barefoot through her wild garden.

Families around here depend on tourism, she said. Eco-lodges host foreign visitors, while shops and restaurants along the nearby river cater to residents of Mocoa, who flock here on weekends to bathe in clean water from the mountains.

If copper’s potential is as big as the businessmen insist, Cely worries what it means for this place in the Amazonian highlands.

“The culture of our territory would change,” she said as tamarin monkeys chirped in the canopy above her house and a pig napped on the porch. “We’d end up being a mining city.”

The Energy Transition and Indigenous Land

Thousands of projects like Mocoa are advancing globally. Most are located on or near the lands of Indigenous people or small, traditional farmers, according to a study published in 2022 in the journal Nature Sustainability.

The study tallied 5,097 projects to mine metals for the energy transition, including more than 1,500 operating mines and almost 3,600 in development. More projects targeted copper than any other metal. The study said almost 70 percent of operating and proposed copper mines, about 1,400 projects, sit on or near Indigenous territory.

Around Mocoa, Copper Giant’s claims include several sacred sites, according to a statement issued by seven local Indigenous organizations this year.

“There can be no energy transition or real sustainability if it is based on the destruction of sacred territories,” it said. “This is not just an Indigenous struggle: it is an ethical and urgent call for the survival of life on Earth.”

Copper Giant’s claims also include parts of three reservations that belong to Inga groups, the most populous Indigenous ethnicity around Mocoa. In October, Copper Giant announced the conclusion of negotiations with the Condagua Inga reservation and adoption of an agreement “to protect cultural identity, strengthen local capacities, and ensure that development in Mocoa advances in balance with nature.”

But the impacts of a mine would reach farther than the reservations within its claims, said Ingry Paola Mojanajinsoy Buesaquillo, chair of the association of Inga councils in the city of Villagarzón, 10 miles downriver from Mocoa. Everyone who relies on the rivers that flow from those mountains, she said, should worry.

“The copper project affects us all,” Mojanajinsoy said, speaking in a garden of the association’s headquarters. “They are above and we are below.”

Communities will wither without their water sources, she said. She’s seen it happen thanks to oil drilling. This week she’s in Brazil, at the U.N. conference on climate change, asking leaders to stop the advance of oil companies in her territory, as well as the copper mines that are supposed to replace them.

“Do the energy transition without sacrificing Indigenous territory,” she said. “Otherwise it’s going from one bad thing to another.”

Waste and Other Risks

The biggest environmental risks of mining operations stem from their enormous volumes of waste. Mine operators crush millions of tons of rock, mix it with fluids, extract small concentrations of desired metals, then discard the sludge, called tailings. To contain tailings, companies build pits, dams and other impoundment structures, which periodically fail.

For example, this year in Zambia, a dam on a tailings reservoir broke at a copper mine, spilling the toxic sludge into the country’s main river. In Brazil, a tailings dam collapse in 2019 flattened nearby villages and killed 270 people. Another Brazilian tailings dam failed in 2015, spreading pollutants along more than 400 miles of waterways. Tailings dams collapsed in 2014 at copper mines in Mexico and Canada, contaminating water sources of Indigenous communities.

Mine waste contains natural minerals that may be harmful. Studies of tailings from Andean copper deposits in Chile found arsenic and cadmium, which cause cancer, as well as lead and other heavy metals. The tailings also contain sulfide minerals like pyrite, which transform into acid when exposed to air and water, dissolving rocks, carving pathways and creating runoff.

Other studies in Chile have identified tailings contaminants in farm soils several kilometers from a copper mine, and in the air of Indigenous villages some 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) away. The city of Calama, known as Chile’s copper capital, has lung cancer rates almost three times the national average.

Natural disasters can also destabilize mines. This year, earthquakes caused a deadly collapse at a copper mine in Chile and flooding at a copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A landslide in September killed seven workers at an Indonesian copper mine. Mocoa suffered a catastrophic landslide in 2017 that killed more than 300 people and left many locals wary of plans to mine in the mountains.

“Mining is a risky activity,” said Oscar Jaime Restrepo Baena, a mine engineer and professor at the National University of Colombia’s school of mines in Medellin. “It must be done well and it must be done responsibly.”

Colombia lacks experience with mining or comprehensive mining policy, he said. But with the right balance of foreign technical expertise and local community involvement, he believes Colombia can develop a clean, safe mining sector.

He said the Mocoa project has “enormous potential,” and that Copper Giant has conducted notable public outreach to win local support.

“Communities are right to have fears, and companies have an obligation to address them,” Restrepo said. “Trust isn’t given overnight. Trust must be earned.”

Oil’s Dirty Legacy

Mojanajinsoy does not trust the company. For her, mining disasters are easy to imagine. Despite promises of a clean energy revolution, her expectations for copper come from her experience with oil.

Spills have become part of life since oil companies arrived decades ago, she said. The largest in recent memory happened just over a year ago at a site owned by Canadian driller Gran Tierra on the Wasipungo Inga reservation, a 1,780-acre forested preserve where Mojanajinsoy lives with her two daughters and hundreds of other Inga families.

It left oil in the creek for eight months, she said.

“The rivers have suffered,” Mojanajinsoy said. “After they are contaminated, they don’t go back.”

Local news websites ran a press release from Gran Tierra that blamed vandals for opening the valves of eight tanker trucks. In a statement to Inside Climate News, a Gran Tierra spokesperson said the company led and paid for cleanup after the spill, and that it continues to support local authorities investigating who was responsible.

“We believe that responsible energy development should generate long-term value for people, communities, and the country,” said the spokesperson, Nicolas Barrios Rubio. “Gran Tierra Energy is committed to protecting freshwater resources in Colombia.”

Water pollution isn’t the worst of Mojanajinsoy’s fears. Beyond environmental destruction, oil drilling brought cultural destruction of Indigenous people as the flood of wildcatters, money and development gradually pushed the Inga and others to the periphery of their own lands.

“Territory is everything, for the culture to continue, for new generations,” Mojanajinsoy said. “Culture gets lost with the territory.”

“We’re in an unstoppable loss of that ancestral knowledge,” said Carlos Fernandez, a local representative of the international nonprofit Amazon Watch. “Many of the pueblos are in danger of cultural extinction.”

An “Important Step”

Miguel Vargas Vidal, an ethnic liaison for Copper Giant in Mocoa, understands why people are suspicious. He also experienced the problems of oil drilling here. A member of the Guitoto Murui pueblo, he lives with his Inga wife on a reservation.

Vargas visits rural communities in the areas of Copper Giant’s exploration activities to learn about their needs, explain the project and build trust with the company. He reminds them Copper Giant isn’t a mining company, only an exploration company. Copper will not be a repeat of oil, he insists.

“We should learn from those errors,” he said. “We don’t have to be afraid.”

Development for Indigenous people doesn’t mean building roads and stores, he said. It means fortifying culture. That’s why Copper Giant works through the traditional social structures to provide in-kind support for customary activities, like communal work days, Vargas said. The company also sponsors traditional carnivals for the communities.

In October, when Copper Giant announced its agreement with the Condagua Inga reservation, it laid out six initiatives to protect cultural identity, preserve the Inga language, acknowledge traditional ecological wisdom and safeguard local water sources.

Vargas said environmentalists have spun up dramatic scenarios to spread fear about the copper project: that it will collapse the mountain, that it will contaminate the water, that its riches will go to foreign countries. He asked how they can make such specific predictions about a mine plan that doesn’t exist yet?

“The unknown always generates fear,” he said. “We’re making sure this is done well.”

It’s not just a local opportunity, he said, but a calling to contribute to humanity. The world needs copper if it wants to replace the vehicles and power plants that burn fossil fuels. Colombia has copper to offer. It would be selfish not to contribute, Vargas said.

“It’s clean energy. This is the 21st century,” he said. “We have to take this important step.”

An Older Kind of Wealth Lost in the Process

Rivera, the youth coordinator for the Nasa pueblo in southwestern Colombia’s dense forest, still wonders if the energy transition is a step forward for Mocoa, or just more business as usual. She has heard about the energy transition for years at regional summits and U.N. conferences on climate and the environment. Meanwhile, she said, the conditions of Indigenous peoples here have only continued to worsen. She’s never seen an electric vehicle in Mocoa.

“We aren’t interested in your flying cars and robots in Europe and Asia if all the minerals come from South America,” she said.

She doubts that anyone actually needs this copper. Europeans needed gold, but what they took only sits in dark vaults. Gold mining continues to menace the Amazon. North Americans needed oil, then they burnt what they took and now, apparently as a result, they need copper. And they still need oil.

If this is a transition away from fossil fuels, will the drillers leave? Or will the mine settle in beside them as one more hazard eating away the most vibrant ecosystems and oldest cultures on earth, Rivera asked.

She knows people are tempted by the treasures foreigners bring, and she understands the struggles with poverty. She learned about her community as a child trailing her mother, a teacher, and her father, governor of their territory. Now she gives seminars to help Indigenous youth understand they aren’t as poor as they often are told.

“We aren’t interested in your flying cars and robots in Europe and Asia if all the minerals come from South America.”

They also have wealth and inheritance: the knowledge of fish, fruits, medicines and spirits of the forest, which their cultures acquired over ages; the unspoiled places their ancestors left them; the mystical beauty that nourishes and makes them happy. “All of that is part of our riches,” she said.

The outsiders don’t see it. They trample it digging up their own riches, which they ship to their countries, leaving the social fabric of local communities disfigured.

Whatever wealth the communities acquire, Rivera said, comes at the cost of an older wealth that gets stolen and forgotten.

“They think riches are about having so many cars,” she said. “I think riches are being able to live and enjoy the water.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LAFFAY_TPL_MOC_25008_2801.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 08:58:44.593746

By replacing natural gas with solar energy, the technology could help facilities avoid volatile fuel prices and slash climate-warming pollution.
Industrial heat drives more than 25% of global energy use, so this breakthrough has enormous potential.
""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek.","A California oil facility just hit a major clean-energy milestone, and it could reshape how factories, refineries, and other heavy industries stay powered.

Rondo Energy has switched on what it says is the world's largest industrial heat battery, proving that solar power can now deliver the extremely high heat required to run industrial operations around the clock.

According to Electrek, it is located at a Holmes Western Oil facility in California, and the 100-megawatt-hour system is charged entirely by an onsite solar array.

During the day, the Rondo Heat Battery stores energy in ultra-durable bricks; at night, it releases that heat to produce constant, high-pressure steam.

After 10 weeks of daily operation, the system has already surpassed expectations, hitting over 97% efficiency and delivering temperatures above 1,000°C (1,832°F). That's the heat equivalent of about 10,000 home heating systems.

Because the heat battery plugs into the facility's existing infrastructure, it can supply steam through the same pipes used by gas-fired boilers, meaning no costly retrofits.

By replacing natural gas with solar energy, the technology could help facilities avoid volatile fuel prices and slash climate-warming pollution.

Industrial heat drives more than 25% of global energy use, so this breakthrough has enormous potential. Methane, a byproduct of dirty fuel extraction and burning, is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide at heating the planet, so reducing its release can slow the rate of rising global temperatures.

""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek. ""Our customers are improving their competitiveness and slashing their carbon emissions at the same time.""

This development mirrors other game-changing innovations, such as tech enabling cleaner power plants and revolutionary fuel research that boosts energy resilience.

Together, they signal a trend: cleaner tech isn't just for homes and EVs anymore — it's rapidly transforming big industry, too.

For everyday people, smaller-scale solutions offer similar benefits, from community solar savings to energy-efficient upgrades at home.

Installing solar panels is one of the ultimate home energy hacks — in many cases, it can bring your energy bill down to near $0.

EnergySage provides a free service that lets you compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar.

Going solar also makes running other energy-efficient appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500 million a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

This story has been updated to correct that one of the laws requires disclosures from companies that make more than $500 million a year, not more than $500,000 a year.

Airbus also expects the services market in the region to double to $29.9 billion by the end of 2044, van den Berg added, Reuters reported.

The forecast came ahead of the Dubai Airshow, the largest Middle East aviation event taking place on November 17-21.

Airbus, which is among the planemakers taking part as it vies for orders with its main competitor Boeing, predicts widebody aircraft will make up 42% of total demand in the region by 2044, representing the highest share globally.

""The Middle East is transforming global aviation, and the forecast fleet expansion is truly significant, particularly when it comes to widebodies,"" said Airbus President in Africa and Middle East Gabriel Semelas.

""This region is becoming the long-haul hub now and into the future,"" Semelas added.

Lebanon is joining the global artificial-intelligence wave, albeit with limited resources and mostly private initiatives, at a time when Gulf states are leading the region in deploying AI to boost national economies.

Expectations point to long-term, exceptional growth in this promising sector, which is attracting sizable investments aimed at modernizing societies and enhancing performance across both productive sectors and public services.

In remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat, AI specialist Hilda Maalouf noted that Gulf governments and private industries are moving in tandem to integrate AI across their systems.

She highlighted the region’s strong readiness, supported by major government-backed investments in advanced technologies and fast-expanding data-center infrastructure, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Lebanon, by contrast, faces deep structural hurdles, especially in the public sector. Still, Maalouf, an Oxford-certified AI expert, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the country retains a dynamic private sector and high-caliber talent striving to stay competitive in IT and AI, despite crippling power outages and a weak internet network that has stalled the rollout of 5G.

According to Omar Hallak, partner and head of the public-sector practice at global data and AI consultancy Artefact, the Gulf’s ambitious national strategies have put it far ahead of other regional countries.

Readiness rankings confirm this: the UAE ranks 13th globally in the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, followed by Saudi Arabia (22nd) and Qatar (32nd). Lebanon stands at 82nd worldwide.

These disparities, Hallak explained, reflect the widening gap between Gulf economies -now reaping the rewards of sustained tech investment - and countries like Lebanon, whose digital infrastructure and economic crises continue to hinder progress. Despite strong local talent and emerging startups, Lebanon’s AI transition remains slow due to limited government support and weak investment.

Gulf states have forged strategic partnerships with global tech giants such as Microsoft and OpenAI, attracting major cloud-computing providers to build advanced infrastructure.

Their remaining challenge is a shortage in national technical skills, where Lebanon, ironically, excels. Yet Lebanon continues to lose talent to migration while lacking the infrastructure to retain it.

Most Gulf strategies now focus on attracting global experts in data science and AI, in addition to training local citizens. Saudi Arabia aims to train 20,000 specialists by 2030, while leading universities, including King Saud University and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, are expanding AI programs.

Economically, AI is expected to add $260 billion to Gulf economies by 2030, with Saudi Arabia alone projected to gain $135 billion (12.4% of GDP) and the UAE about $96 billion (13.6%). The World Economic Forum reports that Gulf economic prospects already outpace global averages, driven by technological transformation.

According to analysts, AI adoption will enhance productivity, reduce bureaucracy and corruption, and stimulate public–private partnerships. Gulf states are particularly well-positioned in finance, energy, health care, and education. In Lebanon, AI’s most promising impact lies in service-based sectors such as tourism, transport, finance, education, and health.

Hallak added that sectors rich in data, including public services, finance, energy, manufacturing, and telecommunications, will be the primary drivers of AI adoption across the region, especially in economies where energy and natural resources remain central to growth.

Egypt has targeted procurement of five million metric tons of local wheat next season as it moves away from being one of the world's top wheat importers to self-sufficiency, the supply ministry said on Sunday.

Egypt typically imports about 10 million tons a year, with the state buyer obtaining roughly half of that for the country's bread subsidy program on which 70 million people rely.

In the first half of this year, however, imports were a quarter less than the same period last year, according to shipping and trading data reviewed by Reuters.

The government's share of those imports dropped by more than half to about 1.6 million tons, reflecting slower procurement since the state buyer changed from the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC) to the military-linked Future of Egypt for Sustainable Development (Mostakbal Misr).

While the supply ministry said that it procured more than 4 million tons of wheat during the domestic harvest, data seen by Reuters shows that the government bought about 3.9 million tons, slightly below its announced target of between 4 million and 5 million tons in the season from mid-April to mid-August.

Reserves of strategic commodities are within safe buffers and as high as last year or higher in some commodities, the supply ministry added without providing more data.

In November 2024, Egypt's wheat stocks covered five months of consumption, below the six-month threshold Egypt hopes to maintain.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-11/1273142_0.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-11-16 12:02:43.260166

This is stated in a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

According to the study, Oman already has a fully integrated steel production ecosystem, including iron ore enrichment, pellet production, direct reduction technology, and electric arc furnaces. The country also plans to develop new ore enrichment capacities.

However, without switching from gas to green hydrogen, new DRI projects will not be able to claim the benefits of corresponding market premiums.

The country also has great potential for renewable energy, given the significant investments in both solar and wind generation. Cheap, reliable clean energy could be a major advantage for steel producers in Oman.

The country has a clear, coordinated strategy to become a leading center for green hydrogen. Oman aims to produce 1-1.5 million tons by the end of the decade. The metallurgical industry could play a central role as the main buyer.

The existing advantages are reinforced by strong political support and a favorable regulatory framework.

Traditionally, Oman’s ferrous metallurgy industry has been dominated by two companies: Jindal Group and Vale. However, the country is now attracting new players such as Meranti Green Steel, Mitsui, and Kobe Steel, as well as green hydrogen and energy developer ACME Group.

As Soroush Basirat, energy finance analyst at Global Steel at IEEFA and author of the report, notes, Oman is at a turning point

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai made the announcement alongside Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican.

The company said it plans to strengthen the state’s workforce by training current electrical workers and over 1,700 apprentices in Texas by 2030 — more than doubling the state’s anticipated pipeline of new electricians.

Google said it is dedicated to expanding its infrastructure responsibly by adding new energy resources to the grid, covering the costs of its operations, and investing in community energy-efficiency programs.

The investment marks another major tech expansion in Texas tied to artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Google is building three data centers in the state: one in Armstrong County and two in Haskell County. One of the Haskell County centers will include a solar and battery storage facility to reduce strain on the grid.

“Texas is the epicenter of AI development, where companies can pair innovation with expanding energy,” Abbott said in a statement.

“Google’s $40 billion investment makes Texas Google’s largest investment in any state in the country and supports energy efficiency and workforce development in our state.

“We must ensure that America remains at the forefront of the AI revolution, and Texas is the place where that can happen,” he said.

Data centers consume large amounts of energy to power servers and cooling systems. Their rapid expansion in Texas, along with population growth, is projected to nearly double the state’s electricity demand by 2030.

Texas’ data capacity has grown quickly due to affordable energy, easy access to the grid, and a favorable business climate.

“They say that everything is bigger in Texas, and that certainly applies to the golden opportunity with AI,” Pichai said.

“I urge you to give a little so that you may get a lot,” he said during a stock-taking plenary on Saturday evening, giving delegates plenty to ponder during Sunday’s break.

The first week unfolded in relative calm, with none of the usual public clashes, after Brazil’s COP30 presidency steered the thorniest issues not formally on the agenda into extensive consultations.

Week 1 of COP30 ends with uneven progress and many thorny issues still unresolved. Want clarity on what’s at stake? Sign up for our Monday event.

Discussions on boosting emissions-cutting ambition, the provision of finance by developed countries, unilateral trade measures and reporting of national data on climate action were “open, constructive and transparent”, COP30 boss Andre Correa do Lago said.

He said the presidency would prepare a note summarising the discussions on those topics to be published on Sunday, as a basis for countries to take them forward.

But as ministers jet into the Amazon city without draft decision texts to work on in many areas, technical deliberations will wind down and political wrangling ramp up. Invoking the Brazilian “Mutirão” spirit of togetherness, Correa do Lago laid out his masterplan for the week ahead, modelled on three parallel tracks.

At COP30, roadmap away from fossil fuels gains ground – but next step unclear

Technical work will continue until Tuesday on formal negotiating tracks. Those include the Global Goal on Adaptation, with countries meant to leave Belém with an agreement on a set of metrics to track countries’ resilience, and the Just Transition Work Programme.

While negotiators wrap up those technical details, pairs of ministers from developed and developing countries will start collecting views on issues that require higher-level political deals, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, finance and adaptation.

They are due to report back to the presidency by Tuesday, allowing countries to gauge how near – or far – they are from a successful outcome. “Work together as one team to find solutions,” Do Lago urged delegates.

Meanwhile, presidency consultations on the four issues without a home will continue while the COP president will convene a “Mutirão” meeting of ministers and heads of delegation early next week to “bring together various outcomes”.

While the Brazilian hosts have so far managed to keep clashes between countries out of public view, experts say gloves are likely to come off soon.

David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute (WRI), said the presidency has given countries so much room to manoeuvre that it has created an impression of fewer tensions than usual.

“But that will shift pretty quickly next week once we start to see things really getting a bit clearer and more crystallised,” he added.

COP’s climate march takes to the streets again

Indigenous peoples, climate activists, feminist organisations, clowns, friars, cyclists and more came together on Saturday under Belém’s baking sun for the “Great People’s March”, a demonstration demanding climate justice and territorial protection.

Thousands joined the first march outside the COP venue in four years, as the last three summits were held in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, places where street protests outside the COP venue were not permitted by the authorities.

Saturday’s march in Belém ended peacefully at the Aldeia COP, a village designated by the Brazilian government to host the more than 3,000 Indigenous people who travelled to attend the conference.

During the first week of COP, it was mainly Indigenous people who led the two biggest civil society actions: a flotilla sailing on the Amazon River delta on Wednesday and a blockade of the conference centre’s entrance on Friday. Thousands also participated on Saturday.

The props seen at the march included a statue of US President Donald Trump riding on the back of a worker and a figure of Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva using a straw to drink “oil from the Amazon”. A network of green groups dressed in black staged a funeral for fossil fuels, carrying three huge coffins emblazoned with coal, oil and gas.

One of the Indigenous leaders present, Nelson of the Amazon Munduruku people – who organised the blockade of the COP venue entrance – said they were here “to fight, to bring the people’s vindication of resistance and struggle,” and reiterated their demand for a meeting with President Lula.

The soundtrack to the march changed from group to group of marchers, ranging from Indigenous chants and Brazilian music to shouts of Free Palestine and Free Congo.

Adaptation talks held hostage by finance

Finalising a list of 100 metrics to measure progress on adapting to more extreme weather and rising seas after two years of work may have seemed like a relatively straightforward technical win for the UN climate summit in Belém. The COP30 presidency were hoping they might even get it wrapped up in week one of the talks, which winds up on Saturday.

No such luck, as the negotiating groups for Africa, Latin America and the Arab countries have decided they want to use the talks on indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation as a place to press for more funding from wealthy governments. Earlier in the week, as we reported, they asked for two more years to discuss the metrics, which include “means of implementation” – code for how adaptation will be paid for.

By the mid-point of the talks – when negotiators compile their work into texts that are either ready to be approved or need further refinement by ministers who arrive on Monday – the latest version of the adaptation text was entirely inside square brackets, meaning that none of it has yet been agreed among countries. It will now fall to the presidency to find a way forward.

The text they’ve been handed shows no sign of any convergence of views, and includes two main options on adaptation finance – one which would have nothing at all and the other which reflects developing-country proposals for a new quantitative goal of either $120 billion (from the Least-Developed Countries) or $150 billion (Arab Group) a year by 2030.

Under a current target set at COP26 in 2021, donor governments pledged to deliver at least $40 billion a year by 2025. But with aid budgets being cut by many, current predictions are that they are on track to deliver little more than $25 billion, which leaves a huge gap compared with needs.

Global South’s climate adaptation bill to top $300 billion a year by 2035: UN

Parts of the proposed text released on Saturday also aim to prevent developing countries from being expected to fund their own adaptation measures and say that the indicators would be voluntary and left to countries to decide how to use them, in a bid to avoid being told what they should do to make their agriculture, water and health systems and other infrastructure more resilient.

Debbie Hillier, Mercy Corps’ UNFCCC policy lead, noted that the new text brings together the full spectrum of positions raised by negotiators. “The large number of options and brackets underscores how much work still lies ahead and how crucial ministerial engagement will be in resolving the core political divergences,” she said.

She pointed to the reference to providing at least $120 billion in adaptation finance for developing countries as a signal that “pressure is mounting for a serious response to the scale of adaptation needs,” adding that the text “recognises the urgency of delivering additional and predictable public finance”.

On Friday, African Group of Negotiators Chair Richard Muyungi told Climate Home News that a two-year extension of discussions on the metrics may not be needed if there is political will to unlock more funding for adaptation.

“[If] we get the means of implementation in the indicators, I think we’ll be able to agree [them] within the shortest time possible,” he added.

Business-as-usual: Donors pour climate adaptation finance into big infrastructure, neglecting local needs

While adaptation finance has erupted as an issue in the discussions on the metrics, negotiators on this track don’t actually have a mandate to decide finance matters. That is why the hot topic of whether and how to set a new target is also part of talks on the broader finance goal (NCQG) that was decided in Baku last year.

Sources told Climate Home News it may be more likely that adaptation could be allocated a share of the $300 billion a year developed countries agreed to mobilise for poorer nations by 2035 under the NCQG.

Future of $1.3-trillion roadmap uncertain at COP30

COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago today hosted a much-anticipated event on the Baku-Belém Roadmap, a document building on last year’s finance COP. It is meant to chart a way forward to meet a new goal to deliver $1.3 trillion-a-year for developing nations by 2035. But experts said the session failed to provide clear guidance and raised concerns that the roadmap could die in Belem.

The event, which is not part of formal negotiations, was originally scheduled for Tuesday but got pushed back to the weekend after countries failed to decide whether to start a conversation on finance at COP30.

Seven speakers – among them UN climate chief Simon Stiell – read statements for the first half of the 40-minute event, reiterating the roadmap’s main points — a shopping list of measures that could deliver the $1.3 trillion. A handful of governments and observers gave mostly positive feedback.

Ali Mohamed, special climate envoy of Kenya, proposed incorporating its short-term recommendations in the decisions made at COP30. One of those recommendations invites developed countries to consider working together on a delivery plan to achieve the $300 billion they are due to mobilise annually by 2035.

China’s delegate Chen Zhihua told the event that “greater clarity is needed on the implementation path” of that goal.

Corrêa do Lago emphasised that only the $300-billion core goal approved in Baku “is in the process of negotiation” and that the roadmap to 1.3T “is still something open”.

Roadmap to $1.3 trillion seeks to tip climate finance scales but way forward unclear

A representative of Colombia said, on behalf of the AILAC group of Latin American countries, that the report confuses actions to support developing countries with actions to transform all financing flows, and requested to discuss it formally in the UN climate regime.

Some observers were critical of the Brazil-led event at COP30, arguing that it risks leaving the formal negotiations with no clear guidance on finance.

“What happened today was not a conversation. It was not even a format that allows interaction with the presidency,” said Sandra Guzmán, director of the nonprofit Climate Finance Group for Latin America and the Caribbean (GFLAC).

She added that not enough developing countries were represented because at the time climate finance negotiators were in other rooms, attempting to carry the talks forward.

Joe Thwaites, senior climate finance advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said the risk of lacking clear guidance is that developed countries could fail to deliver the finance goal, as happened in the past with a previous $100bn goal that was delivered two years late. “I’m really worried that we’re going to be in the same position for the $1.3 trillion, which is a goal 13 times the size,” he added.

Azerbaijani lead finance negotiator Elmaddin Mehdiyev told Climate Home that the mandate to deliver the Baku-Belem roadmap has been completed and focusing on implementation is now “much more important”.

He added that getting the roadmap endorsed or welcomed formally by governments at COP30 was not key to taking it forward as it is a “non-negotiated document”.

Asked about this possibility after the event, Corrêa do Lago told Climate Home News: “There’s a movement starting, but we’ll see how the countries react. I think it’s unlikely to happen in Belém.”

Brazil launches flagship climate and trade forum

The COP30 presidency this Saturday launched a forum for countries to discuss climate and trade, seen by Brazil as one of its “flagship” initiatives outside of the formal talks.

Trade has been one of the most contentious issues at the summit in Belém, after the Like Minded group of emerging economies pushed for an agenda item on the topic at the start of the UN climate talks.

Several countries in that group – among them China, India and Iran – have been hit by US or European trade restrictions such as the recent US tariffs on solar imports. “Collaboration remains the only viable path to solving the global crisis; only through unity can we overcome it,” said Li Gao, China’s head of delegation at the launch event for the Integrated Forum on Climate Change and Trade (IFCCT).

After a week of consultations, countries have yet to agree on whether to hold such a conversation at COP30 and the first reactions to the IFCCT were lukewarm. A senior EU negotiator said on Wednesday that the bloc does not want to address trade disputes at COP that belong in the World Trade Organization.

For now, the Brazil-led forum is in a consultation phase, including on “modalities and thematic focus”, according to its official website. The IFCCT is intended to run for an initial phase of three years from early 2026 to end 2028 and is open for countries to join, it says.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/Portada-3-Funeral-dos-Combustiveis-Fosseis-Gentileza_-Artyc-Studio-amarilismarisa-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:06.300813

(Reuters) — The U.S. Energy Department said on Nov. 12 that it has bought 900,000 barrels of crude oil for nearly $56 million, a small step in replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Trafigura Trading will supply 600,000 barrels while Energy Transfer Crude Marketing will supply 300,000 barrels, an Energy Department document said. The solicitation, which called for up to 1 million barrels, was announced in October.

The oil will be delivered in December and January to the Bryan Mound SPR site in Texas, the Energy Department said.

President Donald Trump's administration has been looking to replenish the SPR, but has been limited by a lack of funds and by ongoing maintenance at the reserve, held in a series of hollowed-out salt caverns on the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

Pumps, pipes and other above-ground SPR infrastructure are constantly exposed to corrosive, salty air.

Trump's tax and spending bill included about $171 million for the SPR oil purchases and maintenance, much less than the $1.3 billion that had originally been in the legislation.

Buying more oil for the SPR will likely require the passage of new legislation.

The previous administration of former President Joe Biden sold record amounts of oil from the SPR, including a 180-million-barrel sale after Russia, one of the world's top oil producers, invaded Ukraine in 2022.

The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has warned of “self-imposed and arbitrary fiscal rules” and urged a “rethink of the fiscal framework“.
In this assumed context they considered higher public investment would crowd out private investment.","Securing the foundations

Last year’s Budget set a new course in motion, but more is now needed to sustain change and secure stronger growth and higher living standards.

The country needs significant sustained investment. This must include ensuring decent public services can fully play their role in boosting productivity, growth and living standards.

To deliver effectively, action is needed to boost growth (and reduce costs of government borrowing) and to raise revenues.

Existing capital investment commitments should be at least protected and should be expanded – including by ensuring the National Wealth Fund has powers to borrow.

Faster progress is needed on closer EU trade.

Now is the time to address historic imbalances in how labour and capital are taxed, and to raise urgently needed revenues.

This should include a significant increase in the bank surcharge, CGT reform and increased taxation on gambling companies.

The government must also ensure that its approach to managing the public finances in the longer-term is conducive with securing strong, sustained growth – an independent commission should be established to consider how the management of our public finances should continue to evolve.

It is vital that we oversee our public finances using credible fiscal rules, but also that these rules are grounded in the evidence of recent years and promote economic stability.

Last year’s Budget set a new course in motion, but more is needed to sustain change and secure stronger growth and higher living standards. This will need higher public spending, and therefore action to both raise new revenues and bring down the costs of government borrowing.

Capital investment must be sustained and increased

The increase in public investment to 2.7 per cent of GDP, and associated infrastructure initiatives, is vital to growth going forwards. It is imperative that this approach is maintained in the years ahead. Without government action, the default trajectory would have seen UK industry remaining starved of long-term investment and shrinking further. Without continued public investment to drive industrial upgrades and boosts to productivity, UK manufacturing risks becoming increasingly uncompetitive, with domestic production offshored to countries with move active states.

Likewise action in last year’s Budget to free up further borrowing by changing the target measure to public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) was welcome. Government borrowing is now based on a more complete picture of the government's financial position than the traditional Public Sector Net Debt (PSND) measure. By including the value of financial assets like student loans and other government investments alongside liabilities, PSNFL allows the government to fund investments that build assets, which can then be used to pay off the debt over time. This increases the scope to increase public investment without violating borrowing rules.

The Treasury should now take full advantage of these new freedoms and empower the National Wealth Fund to borrow directly from capital markets to increase its capital pool – an approach that would be in line with our current fiscal rules.

Stronger EU trade should be secured as soon as possible

With UK exports to the US now facing additional tariffs, it is more important than ever that the UK can improve trade and investment with the EU, our closest and most integrated trading partner.

The TUC welcomes the priority the government has placed on building a closer UK-EU relationship and the achievement of the Common Understanding in May between the UK and EU. It is critical that the government secures as soon as possible the commitments outlined in the UK-EU Common Understanding to remove barriers to trade in agrifood products, EU carbon border tariffs for steel exports, enable young workers more opportunities to work and study in the EU and allow UK defence companies to bid for contracts from the EU SAFE fund - which will promote jobs across the country.

The TUC and our sister trade unions in countries across the EU have common objectives a closer UK-EU relationship as affirmed in the joint statement the TUC released with the European Trade Union Confederation in March. We would like to see the government build on the Common Understanding to:

remove barriers to trade in chemicals and pharmaceuticals which have faced significant additional costs since Brexit which have put jobs and conditions at risk.

see barriers for touring artists removed.

strengthen Level Playing Field commitments in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement by agreeing to implement improvements to workers’ rights made in the EU, so UK workers do not fall behind.

We look forward to continuing to engage with the government on the UK-EU reset negotiations, including through our role chairing the UK-EU Domestic Advisory Group.

Fairer, better taxes

Given the imperative to support and increase public investment, the TUC supports a wealth tax package with higher taxes on wealth, banks and gambling companies. Decent public services play a vital role in boosting productivity, growth and living standards – whether through improving the nation’s health, boosting educational performance or ensuring that people with caring responsibilities are able to work. In polling undertaken before the election, 81% of business leaders said that public services were important to the success of their business, and 89% said that public service improvements should be a government priority. The Resolution Foundation has set out the huge ‘in-kind’ benefit that public services make to the living standards of low and middle income households.

As well as raising vital revenues, fair taxes can also address wider policy challenges. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has recently warned that the UK tax system is characterised by “a large, unjustified and problematic bias against employment and labour incomes and in favour of business ownership and capital”. This can create wider distortions – with the incomes of low and middle earners taxed at rates that are much higher than those who make many times more from their investments. As workers spend a larger share of their incomes than the wealthy, the current design of our tax system is holding back wider spending (particularly important given the role of consumer spending in boosting growth).

While some have suggested that it is not falling real incomes but high savings rates holding back consumers, there is widespread evidence that savings may be concentrated among better off households. The Budget provides an important opportunity to start to correct this imbalance, while also raising some of the revenues needed to boost growth and rebuild our public services.

Our polling has also shown that there is significant support for a package of wealth taxes and taxes on financial institutions to fund better public services, and that this support comes from across the political spectrum.V More than two-thirds of adults support a package of measures to tax wealth, banks and gambling companies, while just 23 per cent oppose. This rises to 84 per cent supporting among Conservative to Labour switchers from the 2024 general election. And three-quarters (74 per cent) of 2024 Labour voters who are now learning towards Reform support the measures.

The public understand the need to act. Our polling also found widespread support for a modernised and simplified system, with three-quarters (73 per cent) supporting this. This rises to 83 per cent among Labour to Reform switchers.

Immediately, a package could include:

A windfall tax on banks. In recent years, banks have made significant unexpected profits because of increased interest rates. This has led to higher returns both from net interest (the difference on interest charged to borrowers and paid to savers) and interest paid to banks on reserves they hold at the Bank of England. As a result, bank profits are now even higher than they were in the period before the financial crisis. But under the Conservatives, taxes on banks were slashed just as these excessive profits kicked in. An increase in the bank surcharge to 16 per cent, double what it was before the Conservative cuts, could raise £20bn over the next four years. A 35% surcharge, which would be the same level as the windfall tax the Conservatives imposed on energy companies, could deliver £50bn over the same time period.

Reforming the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) system by equalising CGT rates with income tax rates and closing loopholes. This would build upon the changes to CGT already announced in the October 2024 budget and could raise a further £12 billion a year.

Increased taxes on gambling companies. Proposals for how to increase taxes on gambling have previously been put forward by the IPPR who have estimated that a package of taxes aimed at tobacco, gambling, vaping, alcohol and unhealthy foods could raise £10 billion by 2029/30. The changes to gambling taxes specifically could raise up to £3.4bn in 2029/30.

A 2 per cent tax on assets over £10 million. This would affect only 0.04 per cent of the population and could raise up to £24 billion a year. This would have to be carefully designed and implemented, with learning from other countries that have put wealth taxes into place. Budget 2025 provides an opportunity to consider the first steps that could be taken towards ensuring such an approach can be established.

In the medium term, wider reform is also needed. For example, there is a strong case for a review of property taxation where existing approaches are both unfair and damaging to growth.

A new fiscal commission

The government must also ensure that its approach to managing the public finances is conducive to securing strong, sustained growth.

Under the Conservatives the rules were changed nine times, and the public finances still deteriorated to an unprecedented extent (as set out above). While the Chancellor’s recent statement on the country’s public spending inheritance rightly pointed to the disarray and negligence caused by previous governments, the lesson from past failure must also be that an overly restrictive household budgeting approach to the public finances risks being counterproductive. It is pro-growth policies that will permit our national revenues to improve, and in turn these must be enabled by our fiscal framework.

Fiscal rules and fiscal councils are now part of governments’ public finance processes across developed economies. In a recent overview, the IMF describe fiscal rules as “a long-lasting constraint on fiscal policy through numerical limits on budgetary aggregates. Fiscal rules typically aim at correcting distorted incentives and containing pressures to overspend, particularly in good times, so as to ensure fiscal responsibility and debt sustainability.” They describe fiscal councils as: “often non-partisan, technical bodies entrusted as a public finance watchdog to strengthen credibility of fiscal policies with a variety of mandates.”

The IMF also note that these frameworks have become particularly widespread over the last two decades. In the UK, fiscal rules started with the introduction of Gordon Brown’s ‘golden rule’ that over the economic cycle the government would only borrow to invest and not to fund current spending. Fiscal rules have been part of the UK public finance policy ever since.

The UK fiscal council, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was then set up under Conservative Chancellor George Osborne in 2010 with the stated purpose of increasing “the role of independent expert oversight over the UK fiscal process” and as one of “the post-financial crisis creation of increasing numbers of Independent Fiscal Institutions (IFIs) across advanced democracies”.

Since then, in the UK and many other economies, fiscal frameworks have continued to further evolve. The IMF notes that post financial crisis many frameworks were reviewed to enhance “flexibility, enforcement and the monitoring of fiscal rules”. They also draw an important distinction between the pre-and post-pandemic periods, and note that in many cases government needed to deviate from their fiscal rule limits to deliver support. They reference the post-pandemic policy challenge of “whether and how countries should return to the limits and the fiscal rules, while ensuring credibility of the fiscal framework.” There have been suggestions that many countries are now starting to think about the ‘second generation’ of fiscal frameworks.

The TUC view is that there is a compelling case for further evolution of the UK public finance processes. This should recognise, as the IMF say, the importance of strong fiscal frameworks but also of ensuring that they are fit for purpose and responsive to changes in the economic cycle - rather than reinforcing them (i.e. rules should ensure they are not driving austerity during periods of slow growth when spending is needed to boost demand). The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has warned of “self-imposed and arbitrary fiscal rules” and urged a “rethink of the fiscal framework“.

Both NIESR and Andrew Haldane, former Bank of England chief economist, have set out that our current approach is holding back growth:

Not only are these rules are not being met, but they are also inadvertently constraining the public investment needed to improve economic growth

... Existing fiscal rules risk starving the economy of the very investment needed to boost medium-term growth and, ultimately, pay down debt and lower taxes.

Commenting on New Economics Foundation proposals to replace the OBR with a new institution to work alongside the Treasury, Mehreen Khan, Economics Editor of The Times, is more direct: “In 2025, that noble aim has created a created a perverse system where three technocrats have an outsized say over what the government of the day can spend or tax”.

We need to ensure that our approach to the oversight of fiscal policy reflects the learning of the last 15 years and is fully aligned with the government’s growth ambitions.

In this context, the TUC believes the government must act. Recognising the need to ensure any reform is informed by evidence, we propose the government set up a formal review to consider how the UK’s fiscal framework needs to further evolve to ensure it provides both fiscal and social stability in post-pandemic Britain.

We propose the review could include consideration of:

How the UK approach compares to best practice globally, both as countries respond to the experience of policy since 2010 and to the changing geopolitical context. Germany is only the most prominent country to refigure its approach to fiscal policy, with a ‘constitutional reform of its national fiscal framework’.

The advantages (and challenges) of expenditure targeting over the present fiscal mandate based on debt and deficit targets. Iain Begg of LSE has reported that “Many European countries with far healthier public finances have moved away from debt and balance rules in favour of what is known as an expenditure rule. The main reason is that the government directly controls expenditure and, especially if it plans it over a number of years, can set a stable path for the economy”.

Institutional arrangements including the operation of fiscal councils globally, the roles of the Treasury and OBR, and the timing of fiscal events, and how to make more meaningful assessments of investment outcomes over a longer time horizon. This could include consideration of the OBR’s role in producing the economic forecast, and whether there are institutional arrangements in other countries which could inform a new approach to building on external expertise in forecasting the impacts of specific policy interventions (for example labour market policy).

The role of modelling processes, and in particular the role of the controversial judgement that public expenditure ‘crowds out’ private expenditure, and, in the event of error, the implications for capacity and the output gap. This should keep uppermost the IMF conclusion: “On average, fiscal consolidations do not reduce [public] debt-to-GDP ratios”, which has certainly been the case in the UK. While all commentators including the OBR themselves recognise the role of uncertainty, existing mechanisms also have potential for bias. Ben Clift has set out that any such economic models are not politically neutral, “there is always a politics of economic ideas, and economic orthodoxy is always a social construction”.

The interplay between the OBR’s modelling processes and assumptions about policy at the Bank of England. Both institutions currently seem to take a closely aligned position on the output gap (the measure of spare capacity in the economy) and crowding out (the extent to which public spending displaces private investment). For instance, the OBR anticipated interest rates would have to stay higher for longer after the expansionary Autumn Budget 2024 as their modelling suggests limited spare capacity. In this assumed context they considered higher public investment would crowd out private investment. Separately Robert Chote (former Chairman of the OBR) wrote in 2024 about events in 2012/2013 when the OBR “show[ed] an extended period of spare capacity in the economy”, “… from which readers might have concluded that we felt the Bank needed more help from fiscal policy to bolster demand. That signal would have been clearer had we also forecast that inflation would persistently undershoot the target, but this would have had the Bank and Treasury straight on the phone”. The implication of his point is that the OBR was constrained in its ability to make the case for more demand stimulus in the economy, as it would have found itself in conflict with the Bank of England.

It is vital that we continue to manage our public finances using credible fiscal rules, but also that these rules are grounded in the evidence of recent years and promote secure growth and economic stability.",https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/TUC_secondary_logo_0.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:11.587619

On paper, as Comitta said, RGGI was a good idea for Pennsylvania.

A clean-energy infrastructure should remain a worthwhile goal in Pennsylvania.","State Sen. Carolyn Comitta’s remarks on the Senate floor last Wednesday may speak more to the nature of compromise than they do a grave concern for the future of Pennsylvanians. Rest assured, though, that concern should be considered especially pressing.

The Democrat from Chester County cast one of the upper chamber’s 43 yes votes to pass the $50.1 billion spending plan that helped end a grueling, more-than-four-month-long impasse and threatened the financial stability of our most necessary public institutions and services. Because of votes like hers and the overwhelming passage in the state House of Representatives, public schools, social services and county governments that went without state funding since July 1 avoided any more consternation and pain than they already suffered.

There’s no question the resolution is long overdue.

There’s also no doubt that the biggest concession Democrats like Comitta made to get that deal done — essentially agreeing to pull the state away from a years-long commitment to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — opens up questions about the state’s environmental future that are important for anyone in the commonwealth. Especially the ones who call Northeast Pennsylvania home.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta, the minority chairperson on the Senate’s Environmental Resources & Energy committee reminded her fellow legislators. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote ‘yes’ to end this impasse.”

In other words, the commonwealth now has a budget, which is vital. But it now has no significant climate policy, which is also pretty important to have.

Then-Gov. Tom Wolf put Pennsylvania on course to join RGGI in 2019 as a feature of his long-term environmental policy to counter climate change’s effects. In it, Pennsylvania would have joined what is now a consortium of 10 other states in the Northeast, from Maine through Maryland, in an effort to make it the nation’s lone major fossil-fuel producing state to put a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide its energy producers could emit.

It is a cap-and-invest program proponents insist is both healthy for the environment and financially lucrative. States participating in the initiative can set a cap on CO2 emissions from power plants, which must purchase credits for every ton of CO2 they emit through quarterly auctions. States then invest the money made from these auctions in programs that promote clean energy innovation and efficiency, job creation and, conceivably, even lower rates for energy consumers in the state.

Perhaps just as important, the impetus for the power plants to become more energy efficient and reduce CO2 emissions rises as available credits decline.

On paper, as Comitta said, RGGI was a good idea for Pennsylvania. It was also an idea top state Republicans opposed practically since Wolf introduced it. They saw it as overly restrictive for the state’s energy industry, potentially a cost burden on families that use fossil fuel-generated energy in their homes, and considered the credits an “electricity tax” on energy producers.

Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, a group that advocates for environmental issues in Harrisburg, countered in a statement that leaving RGGI takes away what it estimates to be “$1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy.”

Gov. Josh Shapiro introduced a plan to the General Assembly that promises to create a state-run cap-and-trade program and require producers to invest in renewable energy, but it has plenty of detractors, especially among Republicans.

Given that Pennsylvania ranks behind only Texas among the nation’s top natural gas producers and is still in the top three when it comes to coal production — not to mention the potential boon it could see for nuclear energy producers that have no carbon emissions — it remains critical for lawmakers on both sides come to a common-sense solution that protects the environment, grants industry the opportunity to prove it can operate within parameters that lead to cleaner air, punish businesses that don’t hit standards and reward ones that do.

Leaving RGGI feels like starting over. But making its principles work for all sides remains critical to the economic future of the state and the health of its residents. A clean-energy infrastructure should remain a worthwhile goal in Pennsylvania.",https://www.citizensvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/STT-L-SPLBUDGET-0204-02.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:19.673061

— Erica Rosenberg, Western Lands Project

The future of federal public lands lies in the hands of the U.S. Congress as empowered by the American public. Whatever winds of influence and ideology blow through Washington also stir across vast acreages of American lands in the public domain of the commons.

In Aspen, Pitkin County and the greater Roaring Fork Valley, land giveaways have been many, although nothing near the scale of the decades preceding Aspen’s founding when, throughout the American West, land grants were excessive and often rife with fraud and scandal. By the time Aspen was settled in the 1880s, the outrages of earlier land grants had received pushback by a concerned public and were acted upon by congressional oversight that ended the most egregious giveaways.

Still, plenty of public land was doled out regionally to mining interests, homesteaders, railroads, schools, churches and others for what today seem like absurdly low valuations. An Aspen Journalism analysis conducted by Data Editor Laurine Lassalle of records available through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), General Land Office and Pitkin County turned up 1,175 patents issued in Pitkin County between 1880 and 1900. Information below is based on a further review of 97 of those patents.

For example, Roaring Fork Valley rancher Fred Light (1856-1931) filed for 160 acres of public lands in 1883 and, in 1886, paid $200 when the patent was approved. Light bought the land under a federal provision that invited homesteaders to file for patent under the 1820 Sale Cash Entry Act. The price was $1.25 per acre, about $40 per acre in today’s dollars.

Light’s “Box L Ranch,” in the Capitol Creek Valley, grew by additional acquisitions, including Light’s purchase of his wife’s family’s nearby ranch. A tribute written about Light as a civic leader recounted the profitability and size of his holdings. “Owning and operating with skill and success one of the finest ranches in Pitkin County, which is of ample size, comprising nine hundred and forty acres, and sufficiently fertile and productive to yield abundantly of cereals and hay and liberally support large numbers of cattle and horses. Frederick Light, of near Snow Mass, is so situated that he may laugh adversity to scorn and feel secure of an expanding and substantial prosperity during the remainder of his days.”

Light’s former homestead has, of course, escalated in value since his ownership. Today, the average value per acre in the Capitol Creek Valley is $69,000 for agricultural properties and $171,500 for agricultural/residential, according to an analysis of Pitkin County Assessor’s Office records.

Under a different federal land grant program, mining claims were granted to anyone who could prove that a property was economically viable, a stipulation of the Mining Law of 1872. Under this law, which is still on the books and widely considered antiquated, miners paid $5 per acre for both surface and mineral rights. Filers would often accrue multiple claims, as did a number of local partnerships from the early 1880s in Aspen’s first acquired mineral patents.

In 1884, a partnership of 10 individuals — including Josiah Deane, Aspen’s first lawyer and later patriarch of the T-Lazy-7 Ranch on Maroon Creek — was issued a patent on 4.49 acres for a mineral lode called “Mountain Ranger,” located near Little Annie Basin on the backside of Aspen Mountain. They paid $22.45 on the location claim first filed in 1881, the year the city of Aspen was incorporated with Deane’s legal guidance.

In 1884, a six-way partnership filed for a patent on a 5.85-acre mineral patent claim named “Grand Prize,” for which they paid $29.25. The partnership included David R.C. Brown and Henry “Grandpap” Cowenhoven, two of Aspen’s founding fathers who had arrived here in the summer of 1880 by wagons over Taylor Pass — the first wagons to enter the Roaring Fork Valley.

Brown is recorded in another partnership filed in 1887 with three others for the “Monongahila,” a mineral lode of 8.31 acres for which they paid $41.55. Brown and Cowenhoven partnered again in 1889 with four others on a claim called “Idlewild” of 13.04 acres for which they paid $65.20. Brown and Cowenhoven (sometimes in the name of Cowenhoven’s wife, Margaret, and Brown’s wife, Catherine, the daughter of the Cowenhovens’) appear in numerous entries, attributing to sound investments that made them Aspen’s first self-made millionaires.

Another Aspen namesake, Henry Tourtelotte, also appears in a number of entries, establishing patents on claims named “Tanner,” “Buckhorn,” “Castle” and “Silver Bell.” Many of these claim names are familiar today as mountain peaks, ski runs and campgrounds. Another local mining scion, Horace Augustus Warner (HAW) Tabor, shows up in many records associated with Montezuma Basin and the Montezuma claim, a mine he owned that remains visible today at a nosebleed altitude high above Castle Creek. Tabor, known as “The Silver King of Leadville,” brought his entrepreneurial reputation to Aspen along with an opera singer named Baby Doe with whom he had a notorious love affair.

Prominent founding Aspenites David Hyman and Jerome B. Wheeler are also listed in numerous patent entries as among the earliest investors in Aspen mining claims such as “Mose,” “Little Maggie,” “Dolly Dot,” “Morning Star,” “Little Nell,” “Alaska,” “Siberia” and “Durant.” Hyman and Wheeler represented Eastern capital, which was essential to Aspen’s development and which enabled the nascent city to sustain ore production years before the city’s two railroads ran tracks to Aspen and gave it economic viability. Hyman was a prominent lawyer from Cincinnati and was Aspen’s first major mining investor. Wheeler, for whom the Hotel Jerome and the Wheeler Opera House are named, was married into the Macy family wealth, owners of New York City’s first department store.

The Smuggler Mining Co., whose name still marks the mountain and open space playground bounding Aspen to the east, shows patents that provided access and ownership to one of Aspen’s richest silver mines. It was from the Smuggler Mine in 1893 that the largest-ever nugget of almost-pure silver, weighing more than 1,800 pounds, was broken into three pieces so it could be extracted and paraded on a horse-drawn wagon through the thriving city at the verge of the Silver Crash of 1893 when silver was demonetized and the U.S. currency shifted to the gold standard, abruptly and dramatically curtailing Aspen’s thriving mining industry.

Today, historic patented mining claims hold far-different valuations, not for industrial mining potential, but as real estate valued as high-end properties in Aspen’s resort economy. For what the records show as “mines” in Aspen, the valuation goes from an historic low of $4.50 per acre to $500,000 per acre today.

The Denver & Rio Grande Western (D&RGW) and the Colorado Midland built their tracks to Aspen from Leadville, surmounting the Continental Divide on trestles, through tunnels and around winding switchbacks, the construction of which required monumental physical labor. Those rights-of-way remain public thoroughfares today as the Rio Grande Trail (D&RGW) and Highway 82 (Colorado Midland).

The railroads were granted swaths of public lands as an incentive to build tracks and open the West to resource development. Roaring Fork commerce served silver mining and agriculture for which two competing railroads laid tracks over and through the mountains. Unlike earlier railroad ventures in the U.S. that brought commerce and trade to the nation and received vast land grants, Aspen’s two local railroads were granted only their rights-of-way, which still added up to considerable acreage, albeit linear and confined to specific corridors.

Cashing out the commons

As generous and readily available as local land grants were, the Roaring Fork Valley was small potatoes compared with enormous public land grants that mark vast Western landscapes today and could foreshadow a similar trend if the political powers that be in Washington take on the directives and intentions of the current Trump administration.

In a comprehensive 2009 report published by the Western Lands Project, “Carving Up the Commons: Congress & Our Public Lands,” its author, Janine Blaeloch, lays out the history of public land divestitures and describes the many ways public lands can become privatized, something the Trump administration has been applying as a means of capitalizing on extractive national assets. This is not the first time a Republican administration has attempted to commoditize the commons.

“Ronald Reagan’s Interior Secretary, James Watt, famously proposed during Reagan’s presidency (1981-1989) that public lands be sold to pay down the federal deficit,” Blaeloch wrote. “The Bush administration’s (2001-2009) budget for 2007 called for the sale of $800 million worth of U.S. Forest Service lands over five years and $182 million in public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the same time period.

“These periodic high-profile, sweeping, ideologically driven land disposal schemes gain the public’s attention because they are so over the top. What the public is largely not aware of is the fact that smaller scale disposal schemes are being enacted every day — often by the same politicians who declaim their love for the environment and public land.”

Legislative initiatives are receiving strong encouragement from the current Trump administration to parcel and sell off, trade or otherwise divest national public lands and put them into private hands, severing existing protections, means of preservation and ultimately public access. Although such current directives may lead to a new precedent of commoditization, they are part of a long and controversial history.

On April 23, historian and blog phenomenon Heather Cox Richardson wrote in her daily “Letters From an American” a warning that the Department of Agriculture (which administers the U.S. Forest Service) and the Bureau of Land Management (which is under the Department of the Interior) have been gearing up for a wholesale liquidation of the American commons.

“Today,” wrote Cox Richardson, “the White House under President Donald J. Trump celebrated Earth Day by announcing that the White House champions ‘opening more federal lands and waters for oil, gas and critical mineral extraction.’”

Cox Richardson pointed out that, in fact, public lands already benefit the nation by generating billions of dollars a year for the United States through tourism.

“Since the 1970s,” she wrote, “the right wing has come to see the public ownership of lands as an affront to the idea that individuals should be able to use the resources they believe God has put there for them to use.

“Developers have encouraged that ideology, for privatization of America’s Western lands has always meant that they ended up in the hands of a few wealthy individuals.”

The conservative political agenda outlined in Project 2025, she noted, calls for a giveaway to oil and gas and mining interests by “opening up more of our federal land to energy development, rolling back protections on federal lands, and selling off more land to private developers.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum made it clear in his January confirmation hearings, Cox Richardson wrote, “that he sees selling the public lands as a source of revenue, referring to them as ‘America’s balance sheet.’”

“We’ve got $36 trillion in debt,” Burgum said, as quoted by Cox Richardson, “but we never talk about the assets, and the assets are the land and minerals. The Interior Department has got close to 500 million acres of surface, 700 million acres of subsurface, and over 2 billion acres of offshore. That’s the balance sheet of America. I believe we ought to have a deep inventory of all the assets in America. We ought to understand … what [is] our assets: $100 trillion, $200 trillion? We could be in great shape as a country.”

Bipartisan support for public lands

The Trump-era initiative to monetize public lands hit a roadblock, however, after bipartisan support for public lands overwhelmed the direction Burgum and the Trump administration had fomented both as an ongoing policy directive and as described in the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill, which was voted in by Congress and signed into law by the president July 4.

A draft version of that bill had called for selling 0.5% to 0.75% of U.S. Forest Service and BLM lands in 11 Western states and for selling 0.25% to 0.5% of BLM lands within 5 miles of the border of a U.S. population center.

“A proposal to sell federal public lands,” Caitlyn Kim on Colorado Public Radio News reported June 29, “has officially been taken out of the Republicans’ spending and tax bill after facing strong pushback from hunters, fishermen, outdoor recreation users and, most importantly, Republicans in the U.S. Senate and House.”

U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the chief elected Republican advocate for the sell-off, announced the removal of the public lands divestiture from the bill, blaming the decision on the budget reconciliation process and explaining that he could not get a safeguard to guarantee that the land would be sold only to American families.

CPR News reported that Lee “said he continues to believe the federal government ‘owns far too much land’ that he said is mismanaged and that ‘massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there.’ He indicated that he wasn’t giving up altogether, adding that he would work with President Donald Trump to ‘put underutilized federal land to work for American families.’”

However, according to the CPR report, “the decision [to delete public-land sales] also came after other Senate Republicans from the West said they opposed the idea and would offer an amendment to get it taken out of the bill. Five House Republicans also said they would vote against the GOP’s Big Beautiful Bill if it remained in.”

Colorado lawmakers celebrated the removal of public-land sales from the GOP bill as a defining endorsement for the value most Americans feel toward protecting the American commons. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “The American people — and our public lands — have won!”

CPR News reported that Neguse and Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.) had issued a joint statement opposing public-land sales in an acknowledgment of unity for protecting a key American legacy that crosses the aisles of Congress. “Republican or Democrat — representing red, purple or blue districts — one sentiment continues to ring true: Public lands are not for sale.”

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) wrote on social media: “This is a huge victory for Colorado and the West. Thank you to everyone who made their voice heard and fought back against this dangerous provision. America’s public lands belong to all of us.”

“Protecting public lands is the most nonpartisan issue in the country,” Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited, said in a statement quoted by CPR News. “This is certainly not the first attempt to privatize or transfer our public lands, and it won’t be the last. We must stay vigilant and defend the places we love to fish, hike, hunt and explore.”

Taking a stand on the land

Despite this most recent halt of public land sales, the threat is far from over, warns Blaeloch, whose 20-year advocacy mission before the Western Lands Project ceded its role to Wild Earth Guardians in 2016 was to “scrutinize public land trades, sales, giveaways and any project that would cede public land, and their impacts on habitat and wildlife, natural resources, land use and communities. The goal of Western Lands Project is to keep public lands public.”

“We are about to return to the Golden Age of land acquisitions for private benefit,” Blaeloch said in an Aspen Journalism interview in April. In her focused role as public lands defender, Blaeloch said, “We realized that the Forest Service and BLM conduct hundreds of land deals every year, mostly without public involvement. I like clarity and transparency, and I thought it was unfair that deals were being made without the public interest.”

Erica Rosenberg, a former president of Western Lands Project, concludes in the introduction to Blaeloch’s report: “Congressional processes threaten to trade away, sell or give away our public land heritage — piece by piece — through a shady world of back-room deals, special interests and cronyism.”

So, Blaeloch, digging into her background as a career environmental planner, has pushed back with the goal of making federal land management agencies accountable by tracking land deals, educating the public at the grassroots, and also by educating Congress on what has long been a veiled aspect of American land use on the federal level.

Free land for railroad and lumber industries

Blaeloch’s report for the Western Lands Project stated that the most opportune era in U.S. history for collusion in acquiring public lands dirt cheap or at no cost at all took place from the mid-1800s up to the early 1900s through manipulative deals benefitting large railroad interests and the fast-growing lumber industry.

“Between 1850 and 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the federal government granted 131 million acres of public land to railroad corporations as incentive for westward expansion. These railroad land grants comprised one of the largest categories of public land disposal in U.S. history, after cash sale, homestead grants to individuals, and grants to the states for education and other purposes.”

For example, Blaeloch reports, “the Northern Pacific Railroad, which was to construct its line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Tacoma, Washington, was granted 38.9 million acres, including 9.6 million acres in Washington state. Several other land grants were added to what would more than a century later become the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe Railroad, for an additional total of more than 47 million acres.”

These generous railroad land grants were typically given in alternating square miles extending out from the railroad lines and forming a “checkerboard” land-ownership pattern of public/private land that is still visible on many maps and to anyone who chances to gaze out the window of an airplane while flying over the clear-cut forests of the Pacific Northwest.

Land giveaways to railroads were originally intended to encourage Western settlement as the American frontier expanded. It was assumed that land along the railroad lines would become desirable, enabling the railroads and federal government to capitalize by selling their alternating public/private parcels to settlers who would benefit from nearby rail service.

“In fact,” writes Blaeloch, “the railroads kept much of their grant land, and the federal government designated many of its checkerboards as national forest. Nearly all of the railroad land ‘grants’ were in fact intended to be temporary transfers of public land that the railroads were supposed to sell in turn to ‘actual settlers’ to raise money for railroad construction.”

Some railroad companies kept their land grants even though they failed to build, and some transferred former public lands and the wealth they generated to cronies, including elected officials.

“By 1870,” writes Blaeloch, “the public had grown disgusted with the scandals and waste flowing from the railroad land grants, and this particular brand of public land giveaway ceased. By this time, too, the public was increasingly concerned about having reached the limits of free land and resources, and there was great controversy around the rapid liquidation of the country’s forests.”

By the end of the 19th century, the debate between forest preservation and utilitarian wise use was at full pitch. Preservation was strongly advocated by Sierra Club founder John Muir and his disciples. Utilitarian wise use was advocated by Gifford Pinchot, the country’s first Forest Service chief under President Theodore Roosevelt. Timber and mining industries actively lobbied for Pinchot’s view of the land as commodity, countering Muir’s view of the natural landscape as a necessary and valid public benefit.

Despoiling the garden

In his 1982 book, “Westward in Eden: The Public Lands and the Conservation Movement,” author William K. Wyant, a former Washington correspondent for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, raises, as a popular conception, the idea of the land as ultimately exploitable: “The American has usually seen real estate as expendable,” he writes. “It is something of which there is assumed to be plenty more … somewhere else.”

When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, writes Wyant, the Republican mandate was to shrink government and its influences, and to cut regulations on industry. This afforded a propitious launch of the Sagebrush Rebellion, which advocated shifting federal lands in the West to the states. “The United States had at the outset an incomparable Garden of Eden to dress and keep, as the Old Testament phrases it,” wrote Wyant. “Its husbandry has been at sometimes profligate, greedy and short-sighted and at other times blessed with extraordinary vision.”

Wyant idealistically describes the continental United States as a vast and pristine wilderness, “a domain of incredible richness — virgin forests, great rivers, the prairies and high plains, the shining Rockies, the arid and sandy wastes and the golden Pacific shore. The early settlers found it majestic and unspoiled, and they plunged into it, defiant of restraints.”

But without restraints, the commons suffered immeasurable abuse and exploitation, as a statement from Pinchot made clear in the early 20th century: “Outside the tropics, American forests were the richest and most productive on Earth, and the best able to repay good management. But nobody had begun to manage any part of them with an eye to the future. On the contrary, the greatest, the swiftest, the most efficient and the most appalling wave of forest destruction in human history was then swelling to its climax in the United States; and the American people were glad of it.”

Rapacious companies such as logging giant Weyerhaeuser saw forested public lands not as cathedrals, as did Muir, but as wood lots. By 1974, cites Wyant, Weyerhaeuser owned outright more than 5.5 million acres, a holding bigger than the state of Massachusetts.

U.S. Sen. Gale McGee (1915-92) who served in Congress from 1959 to 1977 as one of the last Democrats to hail from Wyoming, in testimony in 1971, said, “Today, the once-great forests of our nation have been depleted to the point that would shame Paul

Bunyan. It is time to cease measuring the value of our public forests on the scale of board-feet of timber.”

Vast land giveaways were enabled by the 1862 Railroad Act, writes Wyant, when a number of private railroad companies were allocated $65 million in federal loans and handed a total 110 million acres of public domain. In 1864, an even more generous provision was made when the Northern Pacific Railroad, then building a 2,128-mile line from St. Paul to Tacoma received millions of acres of public lands, including about one-fourth of the state of North Dakota and 15% of Montana.

This largesse was coupled with political influence from railroad magnates who lobbied Congress for more land. Support for outrageous public behests also came from politicians who favored rail subsidies in exchange for locating lines in cities and towns that benefitted their constituents in blatant acts of patronage. Industry and business were in on the take at the expense of the commons.

“All in all,” writes Wyant, “Congress gave to the railroads an area nearly twice the size of Colorado and one-third as large as Alaska.” Another gift of the commons came to the railroads in the Forest Management Act of 1897, which allowed land-holders within newly designated and protected forest reserves to exchange, acre-for-acre, their holdings for lands that were outside the reserves.

Under this act, writes Wyant, rail barons were permitted to swap millions of acres of mountainous, desert, cutover or otherwise useless land for “in lieu” timber acreage of far greater value. The railroads then made deals with lumber companies by not only selling their holdings, but transporting for a profit the timber that was harvested from them. Loggers and railroads latched onto the mutual benefits of collusion in the exploitation of public lands, with no evident moral, ethical or ecological considerations.

After a hue and cry of protest from rising ranks of conservationists, the “in lieu” provision was repealed in 1905. However, eight years of rampant profiteering had already privatized huge chunks of the commons.

“In addition to the scars on the land,” writes Blaeloch, “the behavior pattern, too, was carried forward, and the companies established a paradigm that brought them enormous profits at the expense of the public interest, neatly disguised as ‘win-win’ deals. It is a pattern that shows itself time and again in land deals driven by politics, privilege and greed.”

A regional comparison is necessary to grasp the scale of land acquisitions by logging companies: The White River National Forest covers 2.3 million acres, one of the largest forests in the United States. The Emmerson family, which owns and operates Sierra Pacific Industries, a family legacy company since 1949 that logs usable lumber after forest fires and sells it to lumber retailers, owns 2.4 million acres in three Western states: California, Oregon and Washington. How did one family carve out of the American commons acreage greater than the largest national forest in Colorado? Timber.

Still, Wyant surmises, rising ranks of professional and educated conservationists have achieved national influence in the aftermath of public lands feeding frenzies. “An impressive machinery for the defense of the environment and public lands has been built,” he concludes. “Until it is more firmly in place and has the steady acceptance of the American people, we shall owe a heavy debt to the corporal’s guard of environmental lawyers and professional conservationists who man the ramparts while others sleep.”

Congress, freewheeling land deals and FLPMA

The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. — U.S. Constitution, Article IV, section 3, clause 2 (Property Clause)

As environmentalists and public land activists have become aware of the chipping away of public lands through land sales and exchanges, they realized that deals were being made through Congress with questionable legitimacy.

“Congress members,” writes Blaeloch, “were free to wheel, deal, carve up and give away public lands with no rules to hinder them.”

Although some deals were negotiated with bipartisan agreement, many were split down party lines. Geography has also played a role. Blaeloch reports that in the area of protecting public lands, “Republicans favor less of it than Democrats. As a party, Democrats have a far better record on public land protection, but the more consequential split is between Western and Eastern politicians, with easterners being more protective than westerners where public lands are in far greater supply.”

“However, it is by no means just ideology or geography that inspires congressional land deals,” writes Blaeloch. “Frequently, the bottom line is the direct, pragmatic opportunity to reward friends or curry political favor through the gift of public lands.”

In reaction to the gradual expansion of a national conservation ethic, Congress in 1976 passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), which gave broad authority to the BLM and Forest Service to implement land transactions by ideally providing a more rational, consistent and transparent process.

“It was not until 1976,” writes Blaeloch, “with the passage of FLPMA, that Congress officially closed the frontier, declaring that ‘it is the policy of the United States that the public lands be retained in federal ownership, unless as a result of the land use planning procedure provided for in this Act, it is determined that disposal of a particular parcel will serve the national interest.’ FLPMA established procedures, primarily for the BLM, to identify areas that should be retained for conservation purposes.”

According to an artificial intelligence search, FLPMA “mandates a multiple-use and sustained-yield approach, balancing resource extraction and commercial activities with conservation of natural and cultural resources. The act requires the BLM to periodically inventory public lands and their resources to develop management plans that balance various uses. FLPMA also requires the BLM to coordinate with state and local governments and provide for meaningful citizen involvement in land use planning such as land exchanges that allow the BLM to trade federal land for other land of potentially greater public value. FLPMA also mandates the protection of scientific, scenic, historic, ecological, and other resources, and the management of areas like wilderness study areas and Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC).”

Such managerial responsibilities provide oversight, explains Blaeloch, making land transfers more transparent and, as a result of increased public and administrative input, more complex. Many transfers are undertaken to eliminate private inholdings within the public domain, thereby consolidating larger areas of contiguous public land for more effective management. Other benefits include protecting watersheds or other sensitive lands and to serve other genuine public interest purposes.

Regarding the giving away or selling of public lands, writes Blaeloch, federal land agencies have been limited in their authority and they are not allowed to give it away. “By contrast, members of Congress may approve sales or giveaways of any size or nature, limited only by what they believe they can justify.” She warns, however, that congressional exchanges are often subject to little scrutiny or public involvement, with vague language in the FLPMA establishing a guideline that land disposals must “serve the national interest.” Defining “national interest” is key to the future of public lands.

Regarding land transfers, Blaeloch writes: “Perhaps their most basic flaw is that most are designed to serve narrow special interests, even where they purport to serve a greater good. It is now well established that land exchanges and sales implemented by the public land agencies — that is, through the administrative process — can be ill-conceived, badly executed and damaging to the public interest.”

One safeguard is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which provides strict guidelines by requiring environmental analysis and disclosure, as well as opportunities for citizen input. FLPMA dictates that land exchanges must serve the public interest and yield equal value to both or multiple sides in the transaction.

The following protections are required under NEPA and FLPMA against specious land exchanges:

• Public notification to ensure that the affected communities are aware of the proposal and its scope.

• Environmental analysis of the trade’s impacts, including the impact on public lands that would be traded away.

• Analysis of a range of alternatives for the exchange including “no action,” different exchange configurations, outright purchase of private lands, and development restrictions on land traded to the private party.

• Analysis of the ecological and other values on lands that would come into public ownership.

• Formal opportunities for the public to respond to and ask for changes in the proposal, including public hearings and comment periods. In addition, the agency is required to respond to substantive comments and incorporate legitimate concerns into the proposal.

• A “public interest determination” compiled by the agency that outlines the reasons/justification for the trade.

• The right to appeal the decision if it is not in the public interest and/or the right to challenge the adequacy of the NEPA analysis.

• Public disclosure of appraisal information once the agency’s “preferred alternative” is identified and before the land deeds are transferred.

Blaeloch cautions that the administrative route to land sales and exchanges provides a clearly delineated, predictable process. By contrast, she lists the reasons why the congressional route guarantees none of the safeguards provided in statutes and regulations:

•A member of Congress can put any kind of land deal he or she desires into a piece of legislation, and none of the provisions listed above need to be included.

• Public notification is not required; citizens learn about a legislated land trade by luck; by the grace of the proponent or congressional sponsor; in the news; or by searching the congressional website.

• Environmental analysis is occasionally required but is often truncated and far more often omitted altogether.

• Opportunities for public input are available through contacting members of Congress or submitting written or oral testimony for congressional hearings.

• There is no right to appeal a land bill. Citizens cannot file an appeal against or sue Congress. In rare cases, it is possible to sue the agency over its implementation of a legislated exchange if it does not comply with the legislation that directed it.

• There is no requirement for the disclosure of appraisal information. A “summary” of appraisal data may be made available; otherwise, complete appraisal information for a congressional land trade is probably available only after deeds have changed hands — assuming appraisals were conducted in the first place.

“Custom-written bills can provide the proponents with special provisions and guarantees they would not be able to secure through the agencies,” writes Blaeloch. “Proponents can manipulate the appraisal standards, bypass environmental analysis, set an absolute deadline for the transfer of deeds, and add custom provisions that are beneficial to the private parties. This emphasizes why it is a civic duty for American citizens to become involved in any decisions regarding public lands, whether management or transactions.”

Key events in the historic transfer of public lands to private hands (from “Carving Up the Commons,” published in 2009 by the Western Lands Project).

• The Land Act of 1796 authorized public auctions of federal land.

• The General Land Office was created in 1812 to administer the disposal of public lands.

• By 1820, Congress had passed 24 acts granting to settler-squatters the right of preemption, allowing them to buy land without competitive bidding.

• A series of railroad land grants between 1850 and 1870 allowed several dozen private railroads to acquire and sell public lands in order to raise capital to build the nation’s railroad and telegraph systems.

• The 1862 Homestead Act authorized settlers to claim 160 acres of any land subject to preemption, and later to any unsurveyed land. The homestead was granted free for a nominal filing fee, but title was not transferred until the land had been settled and cultivated for three years.

• The General Mining Law of 1872 allowed anyone to file a mineral claim on public lands and receive a patent to the land for $5 per acre or less. Under this law, more than 3 million acres of federal land have been patented. The law is still on the books.

• The Desert Lands Act, Timber Culture Act, and Timber and Stone Act — all of which were advanced in the 1870s — made more land available to settlers and industries.

• By the early 20th century, the federal government had granted or sold more than 1 billion acres, or 70% of the continental United States.",https://aspenjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Olympic_NF_-_Clearcut_patterns_on_Shelton_RD_WA_1957_21851824068-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 00:58:04.344228

Ford's analyst price targets have recently moved higher, increasing by amounts ranging from $1 to $4 per share. Analysts cite support from stronger vehicle demand, improved industry trends, and incremental policy and operational tailwinds, despite ongoing challenges in electric vehicle profitability.

Analyst Commentary

Recent updates from Wall Street analysts highlight a mix of optimism and caution regarding Ford's outlook, with adjustments in price targets reflecting evolving views on the company's fundamentals and industry challenges.

Bullish Takeaways

Bullish analysts have increased their price targets, reflecting confidence in Ford's improved vehicle demand and stronger-than-expected industry trends.

Stronger Q3 results and policy adjustments, such as revised tariff measures, are expected to provide a tailwind for Ford's earnings in the near term.

Rising U.S. auto sales forecasts, along with more favorable currency and commodity trends, are supporting more constructive valuation cases for Ford.

Several analysts project incremental growth as Ford benefits from operational recoveries and a longer runway for its electrification strategy.

Bearish Takeaways

Bearish analysts remain wary of ongoing electric vehicle segment losses, which have worsened recently and pose a risk to profitability targets.

Reduction in 2026 earnings estimates reflects concerns about slower margin improvements and higher losses within Ford's emerging divisions, particularly Ford Pro and Ford Model e.

Caution persists around the pricing and volume balance in Ford's core segments, with specific attention to the potential for heightened warranty costs and challenges in maintaining premium pricing.

Some view Ford's current valuation as relatively expensive, suggesting limited near-term upside despite operational improvements.

What's in the News

Ford is considering dropping the electric version of its F-150 pickup, the Lightning, following disappointing sales and ongoing losses in its EV segment (Wall Street Journal).

The company plans to invest approximately $370 million in India to build new high-end engines for export markets, restarting a factory that was closed four years ago (Bloomberg).

Automakers, including Ford, are seeking to secure rare earths globally as new Chinese export controls raise concerns about the supply chain for key auto components (Reuters).

Production of several Ford models has been temporarily reduced due to a fire at a major aluminum supplier, causing shortages and halting assembly lines for at least a week (Wall Street Journal).

Following the conclusion of federal tax credits, Ford's CEO predicts U.S. all-electric vehicle sales could drop by half as buyers shift their focus to gas and hybrid vehicles (CNBC).

Individual and corporate tax rates stay put, qualified small business stock (QSBS) and qualified opportunity zones (QOZ) rules are fortified, and domestic research and development (R&D) expenditures are once again fully deductible.

This article highlights the most important considerations for individual owners and investors.

What Changed and What Didn’t

The OBBBA keeps the 37 percent top individual rate, 21 percent corporate rate and 20 percent capital gains rate, while making Section 199A permanent and leaving carried interest unchanged.

It restores 100 percent of bonus depreciation (for personal property and some real estate placed in service after January 19, 2025) and full domestic R&D expensing (retroactive to 2025, or to 2022 for smaller businesses). Interest deductibility returns to an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) cap, but capitalized interest remains subject to Section 163(j) after 2025.

Excess business loss limits and the ban on miscellaneous itemized deductions are permanent, while several clean energy credits are phasing down. Workarounds related to state and local tax (SALT) deductions and the pass-through entity tax (PTET) deduction continue to be allowed.

Choice of Entity in a QSBS World

For tax planning, entity choice is still very important. LLCs provide one level of tax, flexible allocations, profits interests, and seller‑ and buyer-friendly asset sale treatment, whereas C corporations are compelling where a QSBS election is to be made. OBBBA’s QSBS upgrades strengthen that case for scalable, venture‑style or small businesses.

Hybrid stacks (e.g., an LLC parent owning a QSBS eligible C corporation) can preserve tax effective incentive equity at the LLC while positioning operating stock for QSBS. Fit depends on investor mix, exit path, projected future taxable income and distributions, and compensation strategy.

QSBS: Bigger Caps, Larger Companies and Faster Partial Exclusions

QSBS remains a powerful incentive. For stock issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA:

introduces partial gain exclusions for earlier exits: 50 percent if held for three years, 75 percent if held for four years and 100 percent if held for five years.

raises the per‑issuer gain exclusion cap to the greater of (a) $15 million (indexed in 2027) or (b) 10x the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in the stock.

increases the issuer gross assets cap to $75 million (which increases every year based on inflation).

Fundamentals still apply regarding original issuance in a C corporation engaged in a qualified trade or business. Execution details matter — gifts and partnership distributions of QSBS stock can preserve status, but contributions to partnership of QSBS stock generally do not. Contemporaneous redemptions can taint purported QSBS issuances. Whether a husband and wife are treated as one or two taxpayers is still somewhat unclear. Additionally, state conformity is uneven (e.g., California does not recognize QSBS). If QSBS is a goal, companies should consider converting to a C corporation to start the clock for future appreciation.

QOZs: Permanence, a Rolling Deferral and a Rural Boost

QOZ is now permanent with updated mechanics. Qualifying gains invested in a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) receive:

a five‑year rolling deferral starting at investment, with a flat 10 percent basis step‑up if the investment is held for the full five years (30 percent for qualified rural opportunity funds, or QROFs).

a full FMV basis step‑up on sale after 10 years (eliminating gain on appreciation).

a 30‑year ceiling; basis steps up at year 30 and any appreciation after 30 years is taxable.

The QOZ program under the OBBBA regime applies to amounts invested in QOFs after December 31, 2026, but may create a “dead zone” of investment in QOFs between 2025-2026 because investments made under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) QOZ program prior to December 31, 2026, will recognize any deferred gain on December 31, 2026. Taxpayers should coordinate exit dates within the 180‑day window and expect enhanced reporting and penalties. Rural projects may benefit from the higher tax-basis step up and relaxed improvement thresholds.

Preparing for and Structuring an Exit

Begin sale prep early, including accounting and personal assets clean‑up, sell‑side quality of earnings (QoE), contracts/consents, intellectual property and compensation, and business restructuring, since traditional processes run as long as six to nine months.

Consider that buyers prefer asset deals, while sellers favor equity sales. Flow‑through sellers can often accommodate asset sales efficiently; however, C corporation sellers of appreciated businesses usually cannot without double tax. Representations and warranties (R&W) insurance can bridge equity deal risk.

Tax‑deferred rollovers can frequently be achieved via capital contributions to partnerships or corporations. Installment sales can also defer tax (watch out for recapture exclusions and interest on deferred taxes). If QSBS applies, sell stock rather than assets to preserve the full benefit of the exclusion. A parent LLC can facilitate reps/indemnities while holding corporate stock.

State Tax Developments to Watch: The Illinois Shift

Illinois now has adopted legislation to source gains on sales of S corporation shares and interests in partnerships (other than investment partnerships) to Illinois if the entity is taxable there, using an average of the entity’s Illinois apportionment factors for the sale year and prior two years. In a departure from prior commercial domicile sourcing, nonresidents disposing of interests in S corporations and partnerships doing business in Illinois may owe Illinois tax on exit gains.

Practical Takeaways for Individuals

For business owners, founders and investors, three themes dominate:

Align entity choice with exit goals: If QSBS is plausible, test a C corporate path; otherwise, LLCs often maximize after‑tax flexibility, and hybrids can bridge both.

Consider deferring capital gains through the updated QOZ program, tax-deferred rollovers and installment sales.

In conclusion, while the OBBBA offers certainty, it rewards rigorous structuring and early planning to maximize after‑tax outcomes.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-11/IRS%20tax%20forms%20capital%20gains%20income%20tax%20forms%20internal%20revenue%20fiance%20investing.jpg.webp?itok=d999y8gK,N,,2025-11-15 22:58:47.811411

Like zombies rising from the grave to devour the living, old coal power plants have begun to shake off the dust, adding to the burden of skyrocketing electricity costs. Not to worry. They won’t last long. The so-called national “energy emergency” that promised new life to the nation’s fleet of aging coal power plants is already evaporating under the weight of new sodium-ion batteries and other economical energy storage systems that take full advantage of the nation’s abundant, economical supply of wind and solar energy.

The Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Solution

By now, everyone knows that wind and solar — especially solar — are the fastest, most accessible, and most economical domestic energy resources available in the US today, with energy storage systems adding to the mix.

That explains why renewable energy has been the overwhelming choice for new capacity additions in recent years. The numbers don’t lie. In the first half of this year, for example, renewable energy resources accounted for 93% of new capacity additions to the US grid, for a total of 30.2 gigawatts, with solar and energy storage projects accounting for 83%.

All else being equal, wind and solar capacity additions will accelerate as energy storage systems drop in cost. The first half of that equation depends on which way the winds of federal energy policy blow, but the second half is a matter of innovation and investor engagement, and that is where a fresh burst of cleantech activity has already materialized.

In recent years, researchers have been focusing on sodium-ion technology as a more economical alternative compared to the familiar lithium-ion formula for battery energy storage systems (see more sodium-ion battery background here). Advocates for a sodium-ion future suffered a setback earlier this year when the high-profile US startup Natron shut down operations at its North Carolina factory and Michigan headquarters. However, other sodium-ion innovators have already picked up the torch.

The Peak Energy Sodium-Ion Solution

Among the torch bearers is the US energy storage firm Peak Energy. The startup launched only two years ago but it came into the sodium-ion scene with a head start in experience among senior executives, including from Tesla and Apple as well as the leading global energy storage firm Powin.

Peak Energy surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar when it burst out of stealth mode in October of 2023 with a business model based on vertical integration and a cost-cutting passive cooling system, and they hit the ground running. In July of 2024, Peak nailed down $55 million in Series A funding, spearheaded by the Xora Innovation branch of Temasek along with existing investor Eclipse and strategic partner TDK Ventures. Newcomers Lachy Groom, Tishman Speyer, TechEnergy Ventures, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures, and DETV-Scania Invest also supported the Series A round.

“Peak Energy claims that its sodium-ion battery technology can offer advantages in cost, supply chain security, scale, and safety over lithium-ion, the industry’s current default battery storage choice. The funding is also expected to lay the groundwork for a domestic, giga-scale sodium-ion battery factory slated to open in 2027,” Mercom Capital reported last year.

Sodium-Ion Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Coal Power Plants

One advantage of sodium-ion technology over other formulas is its scalability, and Peak already aims to put that to the test. Earlier this year the company launched its grid-scale sodium-ion system into the market, and last week it announced plans to build the largest sodium-ion BESS in the world, in partnership with the up-and-coming independent power producer Jupiter Power.

The initial agreement calls for a 720-megawatt sodium-ion system to be delivered to Jupiter in 2027. With Jupiter holding an option for another 4,000 megawatts between 2028 and 2030, Peak estimates that the total value of the contract could top $500 million.

As for what sparked Jupiter’s interest in a new energy storage platform when the old one is working so well, that’s a good question. There is always room for improvement. In addition to its existing portfolio, Jupiter has a 12,000-megawatt pipeline brewing in the US, and Peak Energy promises to deliver more bang for the buck.

“Peak’s sodium-ion batteries promise less degradation over their lifetime and reduced operations and maintenance costs compared to lithium-ion systems on the market today,” Peak explains, putting the 20-year improvement at 30% compared to other systems.

“Lower system degradation can also reduce augmentation requirements, meaning operators will not have to add additional battery units or components over a project’s lifetime in order to maintain storage capacity over the project’s lifespan,” Peak adds.

Peak also draws attention to its passive cooling system, which enables it to bypass fabrication, maintenance, and repair costs typical of lithium-ion systems while reducing auxiliary power costs by 97%.

Zombie Coal Power Plants Rise From The Dead To Attack The Living

Against the backdrop of falling costs for wind, solar, and utility-scale energy storage systems, it’s difficult to see how any coal power plant in the US can survive much longer. The coal industry was already bending under the weight of low-cost natural gas in the early 2000,’s and now renewables and energy storage have added to the pressure.

In addition, coal power does not necessarily meet the oversimplified, under-defined “reliability” standard set forth by US President Donald Trump’s own American Energy Dominance policy. The 932-megawatt Sandy Creek coal power plant in Texas, for example, suffered a catastrophic failure in April and restoration is not expected until March of 2027.

The pace of coal retirements, though, is complicated by existing grid conditions and rising electricity demand among other factors. In February the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reported that the US grid would drop 8.1 gigawatts of coal power this year in scheduled retirements, including some of the nation’s largest: Intermountain Power in Utah (1.8 gigawatts), JH Campbell in Michigan (1.33 GW), and Brandon Shores in Maryland (1.27 GW). However, by February the wheels were already in motion to push the Brandon Shores closure back to 2029. The new date was reached under an agreement between the plant operator Talen Energy, the Maryland Public Service Commission, local ratepayers and utilities, and the Sierra Club among other stakeholders, pending a major upgrade to the regional transmission system.

In addition, coal retirements are not necessarily replaced by renewables. The Intermountain capacity, for example, will be replaced in part by a new gas power plant.

In May US Energy Secretary Chris Wright also shook things up when he summarily ordered the JH Campbell facility to keep running 90 days past its scheduled retirement date of May 31, an order later extended to November despite the extra costs.

The JH Campbell order is just one piece of the coal puzzle. Last spring the Energy Department announced that coal projects will share in a new federal low-cost loan pot of $200 billion, and in October Energy Secretary Wright announced a new round of $625 million in funding specifically aimed at coal, including $375 million set aside to recommission and retrofit old power plants.

Coal industry stakeholders have begun to respond to the new incentives, but one thing is for sure. The sun will rise and the wind will blow long after the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time. When he does, a new generation of reliable, economical energy storage systems will be ready to restore the momentum to the renewable energy transition in the US.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sodium-battery-energy-storage-PNNL.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 19:01:43.829647

But one small program, a $25 million plan to install rooftop solar panels on schools is giving some advocates hope. Others say it is only a tiny step, far too small to fix the state’s long-standing clean-energy gridlock.

In Carlisle, a town in conservative central Pennsylvania, solar power has become surprisingly non-controversial. Superintendent Colleen Friend is leading a project to install solar panels at an elementary school. She said she faced almost no political pushback.

Her district received $252,000 in funding from the state’s Solar for Schools program. The law passed last year with rare bipartisan support. The program just received another year of funding in a budget agreement announced Wednesday.

But the celebration comes with a warning: Pennsylvania is still falling behind on clean-energy progress, and advocates say rooftop solar could be a powerful but underused tool.

A Lone Success in a Stalled Energy Landscape

Pennsylvania has long been known for coal and natural gas, and debates over fracking and joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) have frozen most climate legislation.

But Solar for Schools broke through:

88 schools applied, requesting $88 million — more than three times the available budget.

73 schools received a total of $22.6 million.

Demand shows strong interest across both red and blue communities.

Flora Cardoni, deputy director at PennEnvironment, called the program a “clear success” and said many more schools would install solar if funding expanded.

Why Distributed Solar Stands Out

Distributed solar — small systems on roofs, homes, schools, and businesses — offers several advantages:

1. It avoids grid bottlenecks

Large solar farms must wait years for approval from PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator.

Rooftop systems do not face that delay.

2. It can appeal to conservatives

Deregulation and “local control” messaging help win bipartisan support.

3. It creates more jobs

A state analysis shows rooftop solar would create 3–5 jobs per megawatt, compared to fewer than 2.5 jobs for large utility-scale solar.

4. It provides big savings

In a new PennEnvironment study, Pennsylvania’s 5,000 school buildings could:

Save $342 million over system lifetimes

Power the equivalent of 187,000 homes

Cut emissions equal to 300,000 cars

Distributed Solar Potential (Table)

Benefit Area Impact Job creation 32,000+ potential jobs if rooftop solar reaches 35% of state mix School savings $342M lifetime savings across 5,000 schools Carbon cuts Equal to removing 300,000 cars from the road Rural benefits Rural counties save more per school than big urban counties

Barriers Are Rising — and Time Is Short

Despite strong interest, new challenges could stall progress:

Federal incentives are ending

Many districts planned to pair state grants with federal tax credits covering 30–50% of costs.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled those credits back. They expire next year.

Utilities have long wait times

Solar installers report 1–3 year delays for connecting rooftop solar in areas served by PECO and PPL.

Construction deadlines are tight

Schools must start construction by next summer or risk losing funding.

Some districts are asking for new cost analyses as federal incentives disappear.

A Bipartisan Opening — or a One-Time Win?

Solar for Schools passed with:

10 out of 101 House Republicans

21 out of 28 Senate Republicans

All Democrats

State Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, the program’s sponsor, spent months touring the state and focusing on economic benefits, not climate messaging. She also won support from labor unions.

Advocates hoped this success could open the door for more distributed-solar legislation. But those hopes dimmed once the state’s budget deal removed Pennsylvania from the RGGI program and left major clean-energy bills untouched.

Stalled Bills

Community solar bill — passed the House, stuck in Senate

Solar on municipal buildings — stuck in House committee

Lightning Plan bills — none advanced in the budget deal

Some Republicans, including Rep. Craig Williams, support solar but also push for fossil-fuel expansion. Williams argues the state must adopt an “all of the above” strategy to meet rising energy demand.

Net metering — how solar owners are credited for excess power — is also under debate. Solar advocates worry that proposed changes could make rooftop systems less affordable.

As a result, enhanced geothermal energy startups are currently generating a lot of buzz.
“His administration is embracing geothermal energy, which is primed for a very American boom,” the Atlantic reported earlier this year.
That’s a huge figure, clocking in at more than three times the current output of the nation’s nuclear power sector – the most productive nuclear power sector in the world.","Geothermal energy is becoming Big Tech’s newest darling. Silicon Valley is upending its deep pockets into enhanced geothermal startups in a bid to stay one step ahead of the massive energy demand growth trend being spurred by the AI boom. Geothermal boasts key advantages over leading clean energy technologies, most notably the fact that it’s a constant, baseload clean energy source and that it’s one of vanishingly few zero-carbon alternatives with broad bipartisan support in the United States. As a result, this relatively niche and nascent technology may finally be ready for its close-up.

Until very recently, geothermal energy was only viable in geologically anomalous places where heat from the Earth’s core naturally made its way up to the Earth’s crust – such as through hot springs and geysers. As such, thermally active countries like Iceland were able to meaningfully integrate geothermal energy into their national energy mixes, but very few other countries and regions could. As such, geothermal accounts for less than 1% of the world’s energy mix today, and just 0.4% of the United States’ utility-scale energy generation.

But all of that is changing as ‘enhanced geothermal’ exits theoretical modelling and enters the real world. Enhanced geothermal borrows drilling technologies from the oil and gas industry’s hydraulic fracturing sector, and is even exploring borrowing tech from nuclear fusion to essentially melt away layers of rock to reach greater and greater depths. The idea is that if we can dig deeply and cost-effectively enough, geothermal energy could be available, abundant, and financially feasible practically anywhere on Earth.

As a result, enhanced geothermal energy startups are currently generating a lot of buzz. One such venture, Houston-based Fervo Energy, is backed by Bill Gates and Google, among other high-powered investors. Fervo has already secured the largest-ever commercial contract for geothermal power, having inked an agreement to provide 320 megawatts of power to Southern California Edison utility.

The firm has proven the efficacy of its enhanced approach at a pilot plant in Nevada, and is now “dramatically” scaling up its operations at a Utah plant and readying itself for commercial operations in 2026, all while showing a “70% reduction in drilling time year on year (see chart) while achieving high temperatures and flow rates” according to a recent report from The Economist, which proclaims that “geothermal energy looks set to go from niche to necessary.”

The United States’ public sector seems to be just as bullish as the private sector. The Trump administration has backed the sector’s development and refrained from slashing funding for geothermal in the same ways it has for other clean energy technologies. “His administration is embracing geothermal energy, which is primed for a very American boom,” the Atlantic reported earlier this year.

The Department of Energy recently revised its outlook to increase geothermal’s projected share of the national energy mix, predicting that by 2050, geothermal technologies could provide up to 300 gigawatts of energy. That’s a huge figure, clocking in at more than three times the current output of the nation’s nuclear power sector – the most productive nuclear power sector in the world. The scale of that projected growth is hard to overstate – today, geothermal produces less than four gigawatts in the United States.

Global geothermal numbers are also set to rise in a dramatic fashion. The International Energy Agency, too, has revised its long-term forecast to give geothermal a larger slice of the pie, reporting that the technology’s global potential is over 800 gigawatts by 2050, up from 15 gigawatts today. This kind of growth would make a genuine impact in global energy and emissions trends, and could be pivotal to avoiding an AI-driven global energy crunch. A report released earlier this year by New York-based research firm the Rhodium Group estimates that “geothermal could economically meet up to 64% of expected demand growth by the early 2030s.”

The Jays’ struggles over the last two games of the series at home was an apt analogy for the climate crisis, with G7 ministers gathered nearby.

They also fell short.

The failure of government environment and energy leaders from around the world, and the particular shortcomings of the hosts, left stakeholders frustrated. As has become the theme in many corners of governance globally, political leaders are clearly more preoccupied with economic hardships that are driving decision making around the world right now.

The G7 conference ignored decisive action required to confront the forces driving the climate change crisis, and like their boss, Prime Minister Mark Carney, his two ministers seem resigned to the new political reality: the environment, for now, is taking a back seat to questionable decisions in the name of bolstering a fragile global economy.

The tone for the series of meetings was set early, when U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright dismissed global climate efforts at a press conference: “We need to stop praying to the climate change God that justifies destroying our energy systems, driving up energy prices and scaring children.”

On the same day, Hurricane Melissa, which had formed on October 21, reached peak intensity, becoming the third-most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record and the strongest tropical cyclone of 2025.

It rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a major Category 4 hurricane in just a day, fueled by Caribbean Sea temperatures around 1.5 degrees Celsius above average and unusually deep heat layers that provided a continuous source of warm water.

Making landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane, Melissa brought unprecedented destruction.

Wright spoke of “scaring children,” yet it was children who paid the ultimate price of climate inaction: 10 lost their lives in Haiti’s southern town of Petit-Goâve when a river burst its banks, sweeping away homes (damaging 450 houses and killing 43 people), roads, and farmland in the relentless floodwaters.

Fueled by the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea, Melissa rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 hurricane by the time it made landfall in Jamaica.

(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)

In the Lesser Antilles, gusts reaching 45 miles per hour battered Barbados, Saint Lucia, and Martinique. Puerto Rico endured torrential rains that displaced hundreds.

The Dominican Republic faced widespread flooding that left 1.1 million people without clean water and destroyed vital infrastructure.

Cuba suffered nearly one million damaged homes and 700,000 people were forced into shelters. The Bahamas, Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast also felt Melissa’s ominous reach through severe flooding, power outages and destructive winds.

Hurricane Melissa has claimed over 50 lives and forced more than a million people across the Caribbean from their homes, with Jamaica bearing the brunt as 2.8 million residents faced devastating winds and floods; by November 3, at least 32 deaths had been confirmed, 94 people treated for injuries and over 7,000 remained in shelters.

(Pan American Health Organization)

But it was Jamaica that bore the worst: towns submerged, communication lines down, and up to 90 percent of homes in some parishes destroyed. At least 32 people were killed, and more than a half million were left without power.

The remnants of Melissa also passed near Newfoundland, and gradually weakened over the next few days until dissipating on November 4, southeast of Iceland, impacting nearly 6 million people in total, according to the United Nations.

The storm was yet another display of natural forces at play, and a stark warning of the risks posed by a warming world.

The atmospheric and ocean conditions that enabled this explosive intensification were made six times more likely by climate change, which also amplified the storm’s extreme rainfall by 16 percent and increased maximum wind speeds by seven percent, a recent study by the World Weather Attribution detailed.

In response, G7 nations have advanced efforts on extreme weather prediction, preparedness and response, building on the Kananaskis Wildfire Charter introduced at the G7 meeting in Alberta in June, a direct result of Canada alone experiencing over 6,000 wildfires in 2025, which burned more than 8.3 million hectares and made it the country’s second-worst wildfire season on record.

In June, the U.S. National Interagency Coordination Center deployed federal firefighting crews to help combat wildfires in Manitoba under a cross-border assistance agreement between the two countries that has been in place since 1982.

(U.S. National Interagency Fire Center/Wiki)

The member nations also discussed plans to strategically deploy public resources and mobilize private finance for climate and environmental solutions, targeting vulnerable nations, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), while fostering sustainable growth at home.

These measures, though welcomed, arrived too late to fully address the cascading system-wide planetary climate crises engulfing communities all around the world.

The Earth’s oceans are experiencing multiple massive shocks, with coral reef destruction devastating marine food chains, chemical imbalance altering the very nature of the water and temperature changes impacting entire climatic weather systems.

Ground and water surface temperatures are changing the way food is grown, how cities can be inhabited and the cost of delivering basic human services.

Air temperature and quality is changing the way we travel, breathe and survive in a rapidly changing atmosphere (India reported 1.7 million deaths from air pollution in 2022 alone). Flooding, wildfires and other extreme weather events in areas that seldom saw such devastation, now occur multiple times a year in the same places.

Communities in Jamaica are still reeling from the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. On October 29, the World Food Programme launched an urgent appeal for $74 million to deliver life-saving assistance to up to 1.1 million people across the Caribbean.

(United Nations)

If you do a simple Google search for the reason behind climate change or our warming planet, this is the result: “The number one reason for the planet's warming is human activity, specifically the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which releases large amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, leading to rising global temperatures.”

In 2016, the G7 countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, made a commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2025.

Have they met that goal? No.

Was there a clear plan discussed at the G7 energy and environment ministers’ meeting to meet the deadline? No.

“The conversation that we had in the room were very much focused on a few different issues,” Dabrusin told The Pointer, citing discussions around circular economies, disaster preparedness and protecting water and ecosystems, while not answering the question directly.

The oil and gas program manager for Environmental Defence called the answer “disappointing.”

These are “the ministers of the most advanced economies in the world, and this (is the) commitment that they've made to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025, and here we are waiting still,” Aly Hyder Ali told The Pointer.

“Instead of ending subsidies, they're writing bigger and bigger checks to polluters. The idea that the environment ministers can't think of one effort to address the climate crisis is just bogus. It's completely unacceptable to not have any sort of plan to follow through on the commitment to end.”

Among the meeting’s key outcomes was the Toronto Action Plan on Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency, a three-year roadmap (2025–2028) targeting waste-heavy industries like plastics, textiles and critical minerals. The plan promotes reuse, recycling and resource efficiency as ideas that could unlock $4.5 trillion (USD) in global economic growth by 2030 while cutting pollution and reducing strain on ecosystems, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The second major framework, the G7 Water Coalition Workplan, launched under Italy’s 2024 G7 presidency and continued under Canada’s (which will soon end), focuses on protecting freshwater systems and addressing the escalating global water crisis.

It emphasizes integrated water resource management, nature-based solutions, and the use of artificial intelligence and remote sensing for monitoring and resilience, with a commitment to collaborate with Indigenous communities, civil society and local governments for more equitable governance.

At a press conference at the G7 meeting, Lee Zeldin, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), also spoke about the importance of protecting the shared freshwater resources between Canada and the United States including the Great Lakes, which supply drinking water to more than 40 million people, including ten percent of the U.S. population and 30 percent of Canadians.

Together, the five Great Lakes contain 21 percent of the world’s surface freshwater by volume, and 84 percent of the surface freshwater in North America.

But the same resources have been jeopardized by the Trump administration’s funding cuts to Great Lakes research.

Earlier this year, U.S. president Donald Trump’s budget proposals and administrative actions targeted agencies such as the EPA and NOAA, leading to job losses at key research labs, the halt of critical monitoring programs, and growing concerns about the ability to track algal blooms, invasive species, and water quality.

When asked whether the administration planned to restore the funding, Zeldin deflected, blaming Senate Democrats for recent government shutdown threats. He claimed that Congressional Republicans had “voted 13 times” for level funding, accusing Democrats of stalling appropriations that would keep EPA employees “working and getting paid.”

Zeldin, who represents New York’s First Congressional District, home to the Long Island Sound and other major estuary programs, insisted the administration did not want to see cuts implemented.

“I do not want to see that cut has to get implemented…we want people to be inside the office…we want them doing these important jobs. We want them to receive their paycheque, and we do not want them disrupted by this shutdown,” he told The Pointer, his comments offering little clarity on whether Great Lakes research funding would actually be reinstated.

Ottawa also made its stance clear on freshwater protection in the latest federal budget by keeping the Canada Water Agency intact after leaked messages, first reported by the National Post, suggested major cuts were on the table, though the commitment rings hollow with the agency set to lose $5 million over four years under a maintenance-level budget.

With 20 percent of the world’s freshwater, Canada has immense responsibility for safeguarding its lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands, but the country’s water systems are in crisis. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) warns that all 167 Canadian sub-watersheds are under threat, with nearly three-quarters showing moderate to high impacts from climate change. In a 2017 report, WWF Canada found that all but 41 sub-watersheds out of 167 have seen moderate or high impacts from climate change. “Even small shifts in temperature and the precipitation that replenishes rivers can have a large impact on ecosystem dynamics, including change in water levels and rate of flow,” the report stated. It noted 53 sub-watersheds were found to have “high or very high levels of disturbance,” with southern watersheds facing greater stress due to higher road densities and the concentration of Canada’s agriculture and industry in the region.

“From a climate perspective, this G7 Ministerial could have been an email,” Climate Action Network Canada (CAN-Rac) executive director Caroline Brouillette said.

“Canada was negotiating in difficult circumstances, given the United States’ climate-destructive presence. But diplomacy requires strategy, and we hope Minister Dabrusin finds one for Canada before COP30—and works with civil society to land it.”

Brouillette’s words carry weight: Wright blamed climate change worries for driving energy prices up, when in actuality, it is wars, fossil fuel subsidies and market distortions that inflate costs and lock in dependence on polluting energy sources.

“In 2023, total G7 fossil fuel subsidies rose by more than US $40 billion above 2022 levels, which in turn were a large increase over preceding years,” an International Institute for Sustainable Development report highlighted.

“These increases were driven by countries’ responses to the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”

Fossil fuel subsidies among G7 nations reached a record US$282 billion in 2023, up 297 percent from US$71 billion in 2016. In 2023, Germany had the highest fossil fuel subsidies among G7 members (USD 83 billion), followed by Japan (USD 70 billion), France (USD 38 billion), Italy (USD 35 billion), the United Kingdom (USD 34 billion), the United States (USD 17.8 billion), and Canada (USD 3.4 billion).

(International Institute for Sustainable Development)

By continuing to prop up fossil fuel consumption instead of investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and support for vulnerable households, G7 nations are not only undermining climate action but also perpetuating price volatility, the problem they claim to address.

Approximately one-seventh of the world's primary energy is now sourced from renewable technologies.

(Our World in Data)

If the final remarks by Ministers Dabrusin and Hodgson are any indication, the summit largely wrapped up focusing on energy security, artificial intelligence, and critical minerals investments only.

Among the announcements, 26 new investments, partnerships, and measures were introduced to accelerate $6.4 billion in critical minerals projects, alongside up to $20.2 million in support for international research collaborations and a commitment to advance standards-based markets.

Ministers endorsed the G7 Energy and AI Work Plan to integrate AI responsibly into energy systems, build trust in digital technologies, promote responsible growth, and issued a Call to Action on Enhancing Energy Security, addressing infrastructure modernization, supply chain security, gas market stabilization, and the first comprehensive statement on Nuclear and Fusion Energy with responsible waste management.

What stood out among a flurry of announcements was Hodgson referring to liquefied natural gas (LNG) as “low-carbon” and emphasizing carbon dioxide removal projects, including Ottawa’s $3.4 million investment in four Canadian ventures through NorthX Climate Tech, Arca Climate Technologies’ 10-year offtake agreement with Microsoft for nearly 300,000 tonnes of carbon removal, and $11 million in federal funding to support carbon utilization and storage research.

The latest Early Estimate of National Emissions (EENE) from 440 Megatonnes shows that in 2024, the oil sands added 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e) to Canada’s total emissions, outpacing all other sectors. Overall emissions remained only 8.5 percent below 2005 levels last year, leaving Canada far from its 2030 goal of reducing emissions by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels.

(440megatonnes.ca Early Estimate of National Emissions)

Hyder Ali says it is frustrating to see Canada framing carbon capture and removal technologies as a climate solution.

“It's been around for 50 years and has barely made a dent in removing emissions. It's preposterous, really, because the same countries that committed to end fossil fuel subsidies are subsidizing technology that doesn't work and only serves to further extend fossil fuel production, and somehow it's supposed to solve the climate crisis,” he noted.

“The evidence speaks for itself. Carbon capture is not a solution; it's a distraction, and it is only being touted as a solution because of the intense lobbying that the fossil industry has done, not only in Canada but across the world, for governments and jurisdictions to continue to advance carbon capture and storage.”

On October 31, more than 50 environmental, health, and Indigenous organizations sent a letter to Carney, Hodgson, and Dabrusin opposing the use of public funds for the Pathways Alliance Carbon Capture and Storage project, arguing the $16.5-billion proposal has a poor record of cutting emissions, serves mainly to prolong oil sands production, and lacks consent from affected Treaty 6 and Treaty 8 Nations.

Pathways Alliance has acknowledged that this costly project would cut only ten to 12 megatonnes of emissions by 2030, roughly five percent of total oil and gas emissions in 2024. Hyder Ali says, “the math doesn’t add up.”

The Pathways Alliance carbon capture and storage project, proposed under Ottawa’s Major Projects list, would run roughly 400 kilometres from over 13 Alberta oilsands facilities in the Fort McMurray, Christina Lake, and Cold Lake regions to a storage site just outside St. Paul, where carbon dioxide would be buried deep underground. Over the years, rural residents along the pipeline’s path have raised concerns about safety, environmental risks, and a lack of meaningful consultation including potential pipeline ruptures, groundwater contamination, threats to Indigenous Treaty Rights, and the discrepancy between ambitious capture goals and historically lower real-world carbon capture rates.

(Canadian Energy Centre)

“Most egregious from a public accounts perspective is that the companies that are petitioning the government for billions of dollars in taxpayer money to build the Pathways project are among the most profitable in Canada,” the letter points out.

“If the companies behind the Pathways Alliance firmly believe that the project will meet stringent GHG reduction targets while providing a strong return on investment - something that is necessary for any business venture - then they should be invited to prove the value of their proposal, and then invest their own capital in the undertaking.”

The coalition is urging the government to reject taxpayer support for the project and instead invest in proven, low-cost climate solutions such as renewable energy, efficient housing, and clean transportation.

How easy is that, when the fossil fuel industry’s claws are sunk so deep into the machinery of our politics?

By June this year, the fossil fuel sector held 355 lobbying meetings with the federal government, including 25 with Prime Minister Mark Carney and Hodgson each.

The top three federal ministries targetted by fossil fuel lobbyists include: Natural Resources Canada (134 meetings), Finance Canada (49), and Environment and Climate Change Canada (37).

Four days after the G7 meeting in Toronto, the Carney government announced its fall economic statement, nixing the oil and gas emissions cap, and announced loosening of Greenwashing rules.

Dabrusin then claimed: “I always try and look for hope when I'm talking about different issues, and I think that this was a real example of how you can see people stepping up and really ready to work together.”

For Hyder Ali, the G7 meeting was “an opportunity” for seven influential countries to come together in the midst of the climate crisis, “to lay out the agenda, to set a path forward, to collectively address the crisis in advance of COP30.”

But “they completely dropped the ball,” he said.

“It was a credibility test, these G7 environmental and energy ministerial meetings, as well as the G7 Leadership Summit, and unfortunately, the countries failed.”

Hyder Ali says he remains “hopeful” ahead of COP30, which kicks off November 10, because “there is a lot of great work happening around the world when it comes to climate action.”

“COP30 will showcase solutions to the climate crisis, and there’s hope that wealthy countries like Canada, whose fossil fuel development has driven much of this crisis, will finally show up. We can’t continue with empty promises…it’s time to back up our words with actions,” he emphasized.

He says it’s optimistic to know that Dabrusin is hopeful and what keeps him going are the “many inspiring examples of communities, activists, and Indigenous governments contributing meaningfully to climate action.”

“Seeing that progress is encouraging,” Hyder Ali said.

“The work we do advocating for stronger climate action is inherently hopeful. We’re striving to create a better world for future generations. We have the knowledge, technology, and capacity to tackle this crisis; it’s just a matter of coming together, collaborating, and prioritizing people over corporate profits.”

The government will spend billions in public funding to reinvigorate U.S. nuclear power, following decades of underinvestment. Unlike renewable energy, Trump views nuclear power as key to expanding the U.S. electricity generation capacity and recently announced the target of quadrupling nuclear capacity by 2050.

In May, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the U.S. to develop 10 new large nuclear reactors by the end of the decade. In addition, several tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, are providing billions in private funding to restart old nuclear plants, upgrade existing ones, and deploy new reactor technology to meet the growing demands from the data centres powering advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence.

The U.S. Department of Energy's (DoE) loan office will dedicate significant funds to the nuclear energy industry to support the development of new reactors. This week, the Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated, ""We have significant lending authority at the loan programme officeâ€¦ By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants - to get those first plants built.""

Wright expects the public support for the sector to encourage private actors to invest more heavily in nuclear power in the coming years. ""When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,"" said Wright.

In October, Trump came to an agreement with the owners of Westinghouse - uranium miner Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management - to invest $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country. Westinghouse plans to construct large nuclear plants to be fitted with its modern AP1000 reactor design, which can power over 750,000 homes, according to the company. Cameco COO Grant Isaac suggested he would look to the DoE's loans office to fund the development of the Westinghouse reactors.

However, critics are not so certain that Westinghouse will be able to deliver on its promises due to the company's poor track record. The firm went bankrupt in 2017 after going over budget on large-scale nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina. Westinghouse will have to prove its ability to build the AP1000 on time and on budget to attract the investment it requires.

The Trump administration has developed various international partnerships to help develop its nuclear power sector in recent months. In September, Japan committed to investing in the Westinghouse nuclear project. The Asian country also agreed on an investment deal for Hitachi GE Vernova to build small modular reactors (SMRs).

Also in September, the U.S. signed a multibillion-dollar deal with the United Kingdom to expand nuclear power across both countries. The new Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy is aimed at accelerating the construction of new reactors and providing reliable, low-carbon energy for high-demand sectors, such as data centres.

The question now is, just how long will it take to achieve the U.S. nuclear renaissance? It typically takes a decade or longer to develop a new nuclear power plant, and while adding additional reactors to existing plants can be faster, licensing and approval can take several years. In addition, after decades of stagnation in the sector, developing nuclear reactors in the U.S. can be extremely costly and slow, due to the lack of expertise, compared to rapidly growing nuclear powers, such as China.

In China, developing a new nuclear reactor now takes between five and six years on average, much faster than the decade-long timeline in most Western countries. This is supported by China's strong regulatory system and tried-and-tested development methods. Meanwhile, in the U.S., just powering up a disused reactor, such as that of Three Mile Island, can take several years to achieve. The projects being funded by tech companies, which focus on the development of SMRs, are not expected to produce power until the next decade, and these are much smaller than conventional reactors.

The Trump administration hopes to speed up the development process through a range of measures. One executive order calls for the nuclear power industry's safety regulator to approve applications in no more than 18 months. The recent funding announcement from the DoE's loan office is expected to help overcome the biggest bottleneck - funding. Congress has also kept its tax breaks in place for nuclear development to attract private funding to the sector.

Thanks to greater political support and public financing, the U.S. nuclear energy sector could rapidly expand its power capacity over the coming decades. However, achieving the level of acceleration in nuclear development expected by the Trump administration is highly unlikely due to a range of challenges hindering development, from expertise to cost and manufacturing capacity. So, while a nuclear renaissance is possible, it is unlikely to be seen within the next decade.

This is the first time since the inaugural Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995 that the U.S. will not be officially represented at the annual climate summit.

However, a large number of state and local representatives — as well as environmental nonprofits based in the U.S. — are in attendance.

A coalition of 100 local U.S. leaders — including governors, mayors and other top city and state officials — made the trip to Belem, Brazil, as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among the notable Americans at COP30, bashed President Donald Trump for disregarding the event, which kicked off Monday.

“While Donald Trump skips the world stage, California is showing up — leading, partnering, and proving what American climate leadership looks like,” Newsom said on Tuesday.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, said in a press conference on Friday that the “Trump administration simply does not represent the American public on climate issues.”

Whitehouse, a ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, accused the current administration of representing the fossil fuel industry, “most particularly the big fossil fuel donors who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s political campaign.”

Why the U.S. did not send any delegates to COP30

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to COP30, according to the White House.

“The U.S. is not sending any high level representatives to COP30,” a White House official told ABC News ahead of the start of the conference. “The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships.”

Last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told The Associated Press that COP30 is “essentially a hoax.”

“It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told the AP, follow a two-day business conference in Athens.

Wright added that he may attend next year’s climate conference “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

The record-breaking U.S. federal government shutdown, which ended late Wednesday, also prevented federal lawmakers from attending the conference.

Who is at COP30?

Most of the nearly 200 countries that participate in the UNFCCC attend COP.

A total of 193 countries, plus the European Union, registered a delegation for the summit. Even North Korea sent a delegation to the climate summit, according to a Carbon Brief analysis.

The only other countries not in attendance are Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino, with each having displayed “sporadic” attendance at past conferences, according to Carbon Brief.

Other notable U.S. politicians who made the event include Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and former Vice President Al Gore.

Several mayors of American cities are also in attendance, including Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson.

American cities have always been at the forefront of innovation and climate action, said Gallego, chair of Climate Mayors and C40 Cities vice chair, in a statement.

“Mayors across the country are doubling down to fill the current void of leadership at the federal level,” Gallego said.

Other notable attendees from the U.S. at COP30 this year include Taryn Finnessey, managing director of the U.S. Climate Alliance.

Why experts say it’s important that the US participates in COP30

It is integral that the U.S., as one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to be present at every COP, environmental advocates told ABC News.

The U.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways, and therefore engagement by Americans signals to investors that the world’s largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes of the energy transition, Maria Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition, told ABC News.

“The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters,” Mendiluce said.

Being on the ground at COP is “essential” so delegations can engage with “full strength,” Max Frankel, director of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Institute, told ABC News.

In addition, the scope and urgency of the climate crisis demands an international response, Max Holmes, president and CEO of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News.

It is important to let other countries know that many Americans are still working to combat climate change, Lynda Hopkins, supervisor of California’s 5th district, County of Sonoma, told ABC News.

Although the White House isn’t in Belem to represent U.S. interest, Americans at COP30 are still working for solutions that are in the best interest of the country, Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told ABC News.

“While the Trump administration retreats, the people and companies here are seizing the opportunity to innovate, create jobs, and build safer, healthier futures,” Krupp said.

Although Hopkins said she and other American subnational delegates were “warmly received” by other countries, some prominent figures at COP30 indicated that the U.S. was not needed at the conference to accomplish goals.

Christiana Figueres, a diplomat from Costa Rica who played a key role in the inception of the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the U.S. would not be able to “do their direct bullying” due to the Trump administration’s boycott of the summit.

“I actually think it is a good thing,” Figueres said during a press conference on Tuesday.

Figueres then said, “Ciao, bambino,” which translates to “Bye, little boy,” in Italian, in response to Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time.

Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, described the Trump administration’s absence as “shortsighted decision” and a “slap in the face” to Americans who want clean air and water and lower energy costs.

“The reality is that this work will continue with or without America,” Frankel said.

“ Climate change kills.
Climate change kills.
Fortunately, there are plenty of other climate technologies that are already in the money.","Try putting yourself in Bill Gates’s shoes. You could spend your days on what made you one of the world’s richest people while also deploying your wealth to do the most good.

You could invest in for-profit ventures pursuing things like clean-energy breakthroughs, or in effecting changes in policy. And to mark your 70th birthday, you could publish an essay that would quickly become a global news story.

Gates has done it all. His essay, “Three Tough Truths About Climate,” sent a shockwave through the climate movement on the eve of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil. But the essay is less blueprint than Rorschach test, because anyone can selectively quote from its 5,000 words to support a wide variety of viewpoints.

Like many such documents, this one begins with a strawman. In a move more typical of the Breakthrough Institute, a California-based group founded on the premise that environmentalism harms the climate cause, Gates rejects the “doomsday” argument that “nothing matters more than limiting the rise in temperature.” Little does – but Gates chose to go with “nothing,” a much stronger word.

He then argues that climate change, though a “serious” problem, “will not be the end of civilisation.” But supercharged storms and other climate-driven disasters are already upending lives and livelihoods. Of the five recorded storms severe enough to warrant the proposed “category 6” classification, all have happened in the past 15 years.

“

Climate change kills. Economists can now calculate the mortality cost of carbon. Each ton of CO2 emitted today kills around 0.0002 people. Again, such costs can add up quickly. The lifetime emissions generated by every 3.5 Americans today will kill one person by the end of the century.

Moreover, we are not dealing only with massive, headline-grabbing extremes and global tipping points (irreversible planetary changes). There are also the pernicious, often hidden “slow burn” effects, like the 0.04 per cent loss in annual payroll for one additional day above 32°C (90°F) in any given year. Such costs add up quickly. To point out that we can still live with average global warming below 3°C is hardly reassuring, especially for the poor and vulnerable who already suffer the most.

Gates’s reasoning on this socioeconomic dimension is understandable. His second and third tough truths focus on human suffering and prosperity, and these are indeed the criteria against which climate progress should be measured.

Annual greenhouse-gas emissions, their atmospheric concentrations, the resulting warming, and effects like rising seas and more devastating storms are all ultimately proxies for lives that will be disrupted or even ended prematurely.

Climate change kills. Economists can now calculate the mortality cost of carbon. Each ton of CO2 emitted today kills around 0.0002 people. Again, such costs can add up quickly. The lifetime emissions generated by every 3.5 Americans today will kill one person by the end of the century.

True, many people already die from other preventable causes. Gates himself has called out US President Donald Trump’s administration for cutting aid funding in ways that will kill children in some of the poorest parts of the world. In an effort to make up for some of the shortfall with his own foundation and personal wealth, Gates has reduced his giving for climate programs and investments, both in the US and globally.

No one doubts that there are only so many philanthropic dollars to go around. But climate finance goes well beyond charity, as Gates shows by his own actions.

His own total public health and climate funding have increased over time. “Funding,” in this case, includes support for Breakthrough Energy (which has no relation to the Institute), which has invested in more than 150 companies that need help scaling up climate technologies by driving down the “green premium” (the added costs of low-carbon technologies relative to high-carbon ones that pay nothing for their negative externalities).

Reducing this premium is necessary for many early-stage startups that have yet to climb the learning curve and benefit from economies of scale. Fortunately, there are plenty of other climate technologies that are already in the money. Solar power’s rapid growth over the past half-decade is the result of economics, not benevolence. The same goes for battery prices, which have fallen by about 50 per cent since 2010.

While other low-carbon technologies still command a green premium, most are trending toward profitability. Still, we need creative thinking to help them get there. Co-production helps. A company focused on a single product might lose against incumbents, but spreading the green premium across two or more products can cut costs significantly.

The Gates-funded company Brimstone, for example, focuses both on producing lower-carbon cement and on making money from the alumina extracted in the production process. Sublime, a rival cement startup, is pursuing a similar strategy. (I recently co-authored a study with Brimstone’s CEO, Cody Finke, and a half-dozen colleagues, including an employee of another Gates-funded venture, on precisely this point.)

Patience helps, too. Back when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was the governor of the Bank of England, he poignantly described the climate as a “tragedy of the horizon.” Too many businesses feel compelled to focus on short-term earnings, just as political leaders are unable to think beyond election cycles. But some of Gates’s climate investments, like those in the next-generation nuclear company TerraPower, and especially his investments in Commonwealth Fusion, are deliberately structured to yield returns years or even decades from now.

Supportive policies help, such as the explicit carbon prices and decarbonisation targets in the European Union, or the subsidies that are more prominent in the United States. The key, in each case, is to provide long-term investment certainty.

This is an area where Gates’s essay is especially weak. While Gates fully recognises the importance of policy, he has created an opening for those, like Trump, who put their personal, short-term gain first.

But make no mistake: the benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels far outweigh the costs. Gates clearly understands that. Clean energy is about sovereignty, energy security, equity, and, yes, future competitiveness.

Ending reliance on oil, coal, and gas, and embracing technologies that will only become better and cheaper over time, is not just smart climate policy. It is the best way to improve economic competitiveness and human prosperity for decades to come.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/54917963503_83e0b26278_6k.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-16 04:58:23.753055

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,"" said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you're trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn't make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

""And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people's behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. ""Most people don’t even realize they’re there.""

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they're protesting or backing. If you like what they're doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn't much you can do about it. ""I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,"" he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

This will be a win-win trade deal between the world’s largest country with 1.45 billion people (India) and the superpower (USA). China is a competitor to the United States in advanced technologies, higher education, and defense investments.

This situation will always push the United States government to have a cautious approach in dealings with China.

With the current tariff levels, exports from China have fallen by 25% since last year, which provides opportunities for other big textile manufacturers and exporters.

Leading economies like the United States and EU will always look for strategic partnerships with countries like India to balance China.

For over two decades now, United States’ administrations have viewed India as a counterbalance to China in the Pacific and South Asian regions.

It is clear from the recent statements by the United States’ President about India being the world’s largest country in terms of its population, the U.S. would want to engage with India for its global political strategy and exporting advanced products and defense technologies to India.

While the current tariffs for imports from India are still at 50%, as I have opined, the 25% additional tariff for Russian oil imports by India is being used as a negotiating tool by the United States to restrict funds flowing to Russia. On Nov. 10, President Donald Trump announced that the tariff on India will be reduced, and a win-win deal will be forthcoming.

I believe the tariff rate for India will be about 15-20%. My estimate is based on the existing global base rate of 10% and other pollical scenarios.

Given that President Trump is a firm believer in tariffs as a way of balancing the trade with nations and revamping domestic manufacturing, a zero-tariff regime is highly unlikely. If the deal of 15-20% comes through, India’s tariff rate will be half that of China. China’s rate which includes the Section 301 tariff will be 45 percent. India will come out competitive against China and on par with Bangladesh and other textile exporting nations.

How a favorable U.S.-India trade deal can benefit West Texas

A favorable trade deal with India will be beneficial to the High Plains’ cotton sector in a medium to long run. India has waived its import duties on cotton till the end of this year.

Recent reports have shown that cotton imports to India have risen. India may need a good supply of cotton at competitive rates if it can replace some amount from the Chinese export market. Cotton from West Texas has been having a positive reputation in India in terms of less trash, fewer breaks while spinning and overall quality based on my interaction with a general manager of a South India-based textile mill which has over 70,000 ring spindles which spins fine count yarns.

With the trade deal optimistically expected by the end of the year, it is important to enhance engagement between the United States and India, not only at the government levels, but also trade bodies and professional associations in the textiles sector have important roles to play to prepare for rebooting and boosting trade.

In line with this strategy, two leading professional associations in the field of textiles are engaging on a global platform in India.

India-based world’s largest textile professional association Textile Association (India) through its South India Unit [TAI-SIU] will host the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) this Nov. 21-22, in its annual conference to be held in the textile hub, Coimbatore. With over 600 industry personnel expected to participate, the event will boost confidence and provide opportunity to meet with the representative of a major association from the United States which has leading brands such as Nike, and Under Armour as corporate members.

Gregg Woodcock, executive director of AATCC, will be visiting India for the first time ever, trying to build a solid bridge between the textile sectors of the two nations. He will be talking about the importance of color fastness and physical properties in textile evaluation, which are vital parameters in export trade. Engagement with AATCC is important for boosting bilateral as AATCC is a leading association focusing on quality aspects and standards.

For the Indian textiles industry to be competitive, in addition to the cost factor, improving its product offerings and quality are valuable.

The collaboration between two major nations in trade and the cooperation between the world’s leading associations in the field of textiles will go a long way in boosting trade and relationships between two nations.

This Summer as the Ambassador of AATCC for India, I worked to initiate collaboration in the form of establishing student chapters for AATCC in India. By the time Woodcock arrives in India, four student chapters of AATCC will be in the making in India in institutions located in Bengaluru, Coimbatore, and Chennai.

The Textile Association (India), TAI-SIU event is timely and will be a reboot the textiles trade and technical relations between India and the United States.

Now that the United States’ longest government shutdown has ended, efforts will go into high gear related to trade and foreign policy engagements and hence diplomatic and professional interactions between both countries will be strategically helpful.

But the Global South — led by Brazil — is not playing the victim.
During the past week’s deliberations, Brazil has placed people, knowledge, and culture at the centre of COP30.
For Brazil, the new roads, transit corridors, and bigger airport are not just cosmetic changes; they have succeeded in placing the Amazon at the centre of global climate discourse.","When President Lula da Silva announced in 2023 that Brazil would host COP30 in Belem — the capital of Para, better known for its rivers, forests and Amazonian air than for roads, hotels or meeting halls — many Brazilians were surprised. Most people doubted whether the city could host one of the largest gatherings in the world. Yet for the past 10 days, world leaders, scientists, activists, diplomats, and fossil fuel lobbyists have been flying into this city as delegates from about 200 countries to debate the climate crisis. For the first time, the UN Climate Conference is taking place on the doorstep of a region — the Amazon — that embodies both the scale of the problem and the solutions needed to save the planet.

The first week of COP30 ended with major deadlocks unresolved, as talks happened in the shadow of COP29 in Azerbaijan, where rich countries had pledged to provide $300 billion annually to developing countries by 2035. Now, the rich world is dragging its feet, while the Global South is stepping in. Andre Correa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat presiding over COP30, summarised the mood on the eve of the meeting’s opening: “Somehow the reduction in enthusiasm of the Global North is showing that the Global South is moving. It is not just this year, it has been moving for years, but it did not have the exposure that it has now,” Mr. Correa do Lago said last Monday.

Fractured front

However, COP30 is buzzing with debates and activities even as the rich world takes a back seat on emissions reduction and financing the climate action plan to the tune of $1.3 trillion by 2035. This year, the U.S. — historically the world’s biggest emitter — quit the Paris Agreement; and the White House has not sent a delegation to Belem. Europe is present but divided, with its 2040 targets stalled by political infighting and a rising far-right, forcing the EU governments to retreat from their commitments.

But the Global South — led by Brazil — is not playing the victim. It has responded with ambition. During the past week’s deliberations, Brazil has placed people, knowledge, and culture at the centre of COP30. In a dialogue with civil society, Mr. Correa do Lago stressed that climate action “is built through cooperation among peoples” to ensure that the energy transition creates jobs and reduces inequalities. The host country has launched several initiatives: the “Belem Health Action Plan” puts climate-resilient health systems at the core of adaptation, while a “Green Education” proposal highlights how teachers and students can prepare their societies for a world which is getting hotter. Brazil has also launched a “Commitment Letter”, backed by 130 organisations, to combat climate misinformation globally.

COP30 is shaping up to be the most ambitious climate conference yet, with far bigger goals. The best example is the “Belem Declaration for Green Industrialisation”, which calls on nations to accelerate energy transition while creating new green-economy opportunities, especially for developing countries. Its core message is clear: without strong and inclusive economic growth, true decarbonisation will not occur. Brazil’s Vice President Geraldo Alckmin summed it up on Friday: “Climate goals must go hand in hand with real economic transformation… ensuring that all countries, especially those in the Global South, can lead and benefit from this new era of sustainable prosperity.”

At the inauguration of COP30, President Lula had declared that Belem “will not be the same city” once the meeting ends. For Brazil, the new roads, transit corridors, and bigger airport are not just cosmetic changes; they have succeeded in placing the Amazon at the centre of global climate discourse. With negotiations running until November 21, Brazil is now pushing for COP30 to give a clear blue-print for a better climate action plan.

Belem, a city once doubted for its capacity to host a global meeting, may end up adopting the declaration named after it — and deliver a solution the world needs desperately.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/n6ygtk/article70285102.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-11-14T154446Z_1005411045_RC2FWHA7HYQS_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATE-COP30-GERMANY-PROTEST.JPG,N,,2025-11-15 18:00:14.161049

Sources told the Journal that under CEO Elon Musk’s direction, Tesla and its suppliers have already replaced some China-made parts and plan to shift all remaining related components to production outside China within the next one to two years.

The report noted that years of ongoing U.S.–China trade disputes—and the constant tariff adjustments that come with them—have complicated how automakers set pricing strategies.

A Reuters report in April said Tesla had significantly increased its reliance on North American suppliers for its U.S. factories over the past two years to counter the risk of rising tariffs.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s performance in the Chinese market has been uneven. Earlier this month, data from the China Passenger Car Association showed that Tesla’s China-made EV sales reached 61,497 units in October, down 9.9 percent year-on-year, reversing the 2.8 percent year-on-year growth seen in September.

Production of the Shanghai-built Model 3 and Model Y (including exports) also fell 32.3 percent from September.

Reuters reported that growing U.S.–China tensions throughout 2025 have kept auto-industry executives in “crisis mode.” Under President Trump’s tariff policies, along with repeated panic over rare-earth bottlenecks and chip shortages, more automakers are re-evaluating their dependence on China as a key source of components and raw materials.

GM orders suppliers to remove China-made parts

This week, General Motors (GM) was also reported to have instructed thousands of suppliers to remove China-made parts from its supply chain.

According to a Nov. 12 Reuters report, GM issued the directive to strengthen the company’s “resilience” amid geopolitical tensions. Some suppliers were told to fully end procurement from China as early as 2027.

GM began conveying this requirement to certain suppliers in late 2024, but the rapid escalation of the 2025 U.S.–China trade war has made the process more urgent. GM executives said this move is part of a broader strategy to improve supply-chain stability and control.

Industry sources said that geopolitical tensions, fluctuating tariffs, and supply-chain risks involving rare earths and chips have kept auto executives in “emergency response mode” throughout 2025. The Trump administration’s push for reshoring investment has also driven companies to reassess their long-term dependence on China.

Reuters noted that GM has already been restructuring its EV battery-material and chip supply chains, partnering with U.S. rare-earth companies and investing in Nevada lithium mines. But the new directive is broader in scope, targeting more fundamental and high-volume components and raw materials.

GM CEO Mary Barra said in a quarterly earnings call that the company has spent recent years building supply-chain resilience and aims to source as many parts as possible in the same country where vehicles are assembled. GM’s global purchasing chief Shilpan Amin stressed that supply-disruption risks mean automakers can no longer rely solely on the lowest-cost country.

The report added that China dominates fields such as automotive lighting, electronics, molds, and stamped parts, making supply-chain relocation slow and costly. Colin Shaw, head of the U.S. Vehicle Suppliers Association, said many supplier relationships took 20–30 years to build, and dismantling them in just a few years is “nearly impossible.”

Although China and the U.S. agreed to roll back some tariffs and export restrictions after the late-October Biden–Xi meeting, concerns continue to rise over rare-earth export controls and chip-supply disruptions. For example, China’s recent suspension of shipments to Nexperia triggered industry warnings of potential large-scale factory shutdowns.

Tesla and Samsung in talks as Tesla advances ‘de-China-ization’ of its supply chain

At the same time, Tesla is aggressively restructuring its supply chain for its energy and storage business. According to a Reuters report on Nov. 4, South Korea’s Samsung SDI confirmed it is in talks with Tesla to supply energy-storage batteries—considered another key step in reducing Tesla’s reliance on China-made critical components. Samsung SDI said the deal is not yet finalized.

The Korea Economic Daily reported that the potential three-year contract could exceed 3 trillion won (about US$2.11 billion). China’s “Autohome” later reported, citing Samsung SDI regulatory filings, that the discussed volume is 30 GWh of storage batteries over three years—about 10 GWh per year—valued at 1–1.5 trillion won annually.

If finalized, the deal would mark a major shift in Tesla’s energy-storage business. According to Chinese media, Tesla currently relies heavily on Chinese suppliers (especially CATL) for storage batteries, and U.S. tariffs have had an “excessive impact” on Tesla’s energy division.

In April, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said the company is actively seeking suppliers outside China to ease tariff pressures.

Tesla has also signed chip and battery-supply agreements with Samsung Electronics and LG Energy Solution. In July, LG Energy Solution announced a three-year, 5.9-trillion-won LFP battery order widely believed to be from Tesla.

Analysts say that if Samsung SDI successfully enters Tesla’s North American storage-battery supply chain, Samsung and LG would form a “dual-insurance” setup. This would help Tesla meet Inflation Reduction Act tax-credit requirements, reduce costs, and strengthen competitiveness.

Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents.
City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Hundreds of global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,” said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you’re trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn’t make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

“And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people’s behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. “Most people don’t even realize they’re there.”

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they’re protesting or backing. If you like what they’re doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn’t much you can do about it. “I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,” he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

Texas Pacific Land Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Texas Pacific Land shareholder, you need to believe in the sustainability of its robust royalty income and expanding water services, both driven by continued high operator activity in the Permian Basin. The latest quarterly results, including record production and strong earnings, further supported these core strengths, while the recent shareholder vote outcome on governance does not materially alter the biggest near-term catalyst, ongoing production growth, or the most prominent risk, which is concentrated exposure to Permian development trends.

The reaffirmed quarterly cash dividend of US$1.60 per share speaks directly to Texas Pacific Land’s consistent approach to shareholder returns, reinforcing expectations for resilient cash generation as growth in oil, gas, and NGL production sustains substantial free cash flow.

But while top-line numbers and distributions impress, investors should not overlook the concentrated geographic risk that comes with heavy reliance on the Permian Basin…

Texas Pacific Land is projected to reach $895.3 million in revenue and $610.3 million in earnings by 2028. This forecast assumes a 7.2% annual increase in revenue and a $150.1 million increase in earnings from the current level of $460.2 million.

In the U.K., the government and energy companies have been discussing the idea for several years, and it seems to be gaining momentum with the launch of the first geothermal mine projects this year.

Energy companies have realised the potential of flooding abandoned coal mines to provide vast quantities of geothermal power, as water in coal mines can reach a temperature of up to 20 degrees Celsius. Mine water geothermal heat (MWGH) systems use the water from flooded coal mines, which is heated through a natural process, to supply clean heat to houses and businesses in the surrounding area. This works by using heat exchangers and pumps to recover the heat and distribute it to buildings via district heating networks.

Heating currently contributes around 40 percent of energy use in the U.K. The country’s building heating is a major contributor to emissions, accounting for between 17 and 18 percent of total greenhouse gases, primarily from burning natural gas. Therefore, developing cleaner heat production methods is key to decarbonising the U.K. in line with government climate targets.

A recent report suggests that around a quarter of U.K. homes sit on top of sites where MWGH could be used to provide low-cost, low-carbon heat. “With the right support in place, MWGH could be built out at scale within five years. It’s not technologically complex, relatively speaking, but it takes some governance and social organisation,” Simone Abram, the co-author of the report, explained. Abram used Denmark as an example of where the technology has already been successfully rolled out.

In addition to providing clean energy, the redevelopment of coal mines could bring energy jobs back to former mining areas, with the need for specialists in drilling, engineering, and operations. This could help reinvigorate struggling economies across the country. The authors of the report also highlight the importance of community consultation to gain support for development. Community engagement will help demonstrate how MWGH projects can bring economic growth back to disadvantaged towns and cities, as well as provide clean heating and new job opportunities.

Despite the ongoing discussion between energy companies and the U.K. government about the potential for MWGH, the U.K. has been slow to develop its first geothermal projects of this type. This is largely due to the high set-up cost and the complex regulatory environment. To support development, the U.K. government must update its energy regulations to allow companies to develop this type of geothermal project. The provision of grants and low-interest loans by the state could also help to encourage higher levels of private investment in the sector.

Earlier in the year, the Mining Remediation Authority (MRA), formerly known as the Coal Authority, launched the U.K.’s first MWGH project near Ammanford in Wales. The project uses floodwater from an abandoned mine as a renewable source of heating for a warehouse. Roughly 25 litres of water per second is pumped from the Lindsay pit each day, before being treated and filtered through natural waterways.

The MRA hopes to develop several other MWGH projects in south and north-east Wales to develop it into a geothermal energy hub. However, some projects have been hard to get off the ground due to the lack of familiarity with the energy source. For example, a similar heat scheme was halted by Bridgend council in 2021 over concerns of rising costs. However, the Welsh government has acknowledged the “significant role mine water heat can play in our journey to net zero.”

The MRA also commenced construction works in March on the Dawdon mine in County Durham, in the north of England. The MWGH project is expected to provide heating for a new housing development, a new primary school, a village centre, and innovation hubs once complete. Vital Energi has been appointed to design, build, and operate the system, which is expected to provide clean heat for the next 40 years.

The authority also launched the Gateshead Mine Water Heat Living Laboratory this year to study thermal and hydrogeological behaviour across operational MWGH projects. It is thought to be the first project of its kind globally.

Fiona Todd from the MRA explained, “Our Living Laboratory will provide invaluable insights into the behaviour of mine water heat systems and help us understand how multiple schemes co-exist within the same region… This research is crucial for maximising the opportunity presented by mine water heat and supporting its development as a reliable, low-carbon heat source across the U.K.”

The U.K. sees significant potential in the repurposing of coal mines to develop geothermal energy projects, to provide clean heating for up to 25 percent of the country’s population. However, to accelerate the growth of the sector, the government must revise its energy regulations to simplify the framework for developing such projects. The introduction of financial incentives from the state could also help to attract more private investment to the sector.

Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,"" said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you're trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn't make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

""And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people's behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. ""Most people don’t even realize they’re there.""

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they're protesting or backing. If you like what they're doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn't much you can do about it. ""I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,"" he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

The $206.9 million project is expected to create 1,200 jobs in Mecklenburg County.

The company’s new 300,000-square-foot corporate headquarters, located at Plaza Midwood Commonwealth, will serve as the home base for research and development, IT, finance, sales, marketing, and other corporate functions.

“Charlotte is the ideal home for Scout Motors – a place as dynamic as our people and brand, where heritage and pride meet progress and innovation,” said Scott Keogh, President and CEO of Scout Motors. “With a thriving talent pool, world-class universities, and a deserved reputation as a launchpad for bold ideas, Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably. We’ll build a headquarters that reflects our culture, empowers our teams, and connects us to a region that’s fast becoming a national hub for mobility and manufacturing.”

The project will be supported, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $4.8 billion. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs and capital investment, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $46,524,750, spread over 12 years. State payments occur only following performance verification by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets.

The project’s projected return on investment of public dollars is 67 percent, meaning for every dollar of potential cost to the state, the state receives $1.67 in state revenue. JDIG projects result in positive net tax revenue to the state treasury, even after taking into consideration the grant’s reimbursement payments to a given company.

“Scout Motors carries forward a proud American legacy of innovation and craftsmanship to North Carolina,” noted N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “We’re honored that this storied brand is building its next chapter here—joining dozens of world-class companies that have chosen to invest in our state. With our talented workforce, strong business climate, and exceptional quality of life, Scout Motors reinforces why North Carolina remains America’s Top State for Business.”

Because Scout Motors chose a site in Mecklenburg County, which is classified by the state’s economic tier system as Tier 3, the company’s JDIG agreement also calls for moving as much as $15.5 million into the state’s Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account. The Utility Account helps rural communities anywhere in the state finance necessary infrastructure upgrades to attract future business.

“We’re pleased to welcome an innovative company like Scout Motors to North Carolina,” added Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “Our automotive sector is thriving and rapidly expanding, and Scout Motors will only accelerate our state’s reputation as an automotive hub.”

What's happening?

The report determined that plant retirements, coupled with a failure to add capacity, could lead to a ""surge in power outages,"" particularly as growing demand from artificial intelligence data centers strains grids.

Data centers require immense amounts of electricity. Although some use clean energy sources like wind and solar, they will consume twice as much energy by 2030, per Scientific American.

If the U.S. can't keep up with demand, ""most regions will face unacceptable reliability risks within five years,"" the report found.

The department projected a 104-gigawatt loss due to plant retirements by 2030, which could lead to more than 800 hours of outages annually. It further recommended adding capacity via coal and gas.

""President Trump's administration is committed to advancing a strategy of energy addition, and supporting all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure,"" said energy secretary Chris Wright. ""If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.""

Why is this concerning?

Large-scale blackouts pose a serious threat to the economy, national security, and daily life, and vulnerable communities — including low-income households and those with underlying health conditions — bear the most risk.

Moreover, the DOE's claims that clean energy sources are exacerbating blackouts have been debunked by Princeton University's ZERO Lab, as Canary Media explained.

The current energy crisis is driven by several factors, including a massive boom in data center deployment, increased extreme weather, and skyrocketing demand for electricity for AI applications.

But as the energy experts explained, clean energy sources are not fueling the risk of blackouts.

According to ZERO lab, the DOE overestimated plant retirements and underestimated new generation capacity anticipated in the same period. Researchers believed the DOE intentionally omitted data to prioritize dirty fuels and undermine the clean energy boom.

With battery energy storage systems rapidly coming online — Utility Dive reported that capacity is expected to more than double by 2027 — experts expect significant grid stability even as power plants are phased out.

How can you prepare for potential outages?

Going solar is one of the most effective ways to slash utility bills and your home's environmental impact.

EnergySage provides instant solar quotes and connects you with vetted contractors at no cost, ensuring your lights stay on — even during increasing blackouts, when paired with a battery backup.

Its free mapping tool even shows customers average local home solar costs, available incentives, and rebates on a state-by-state basis. On average, EnergySage users save up to $10,000 on new installations.

For those on a budget, Palmetto's LightReach leasing program has $0 down options, allowing customers to lock in low energy rates and reliable service without a large upfront investment.

Pairing solar with an energy-efficient heat pump boosts energy savings by $400 a year on average, according to Rewiring America — and Mitsubishi makes it easy for homeowners to find the right heat pump and installer for their needs and budget.

Those who plan to claim a 30% solar or heat pump tax credit should act before they expire at the end of 2025, per Canary Media.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jn9qIx3DO7rGOWJ73nWN.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/0e34b804d1aa8c9af9e08c799b671b63,N,,2025-11-16 00:58:12.654248

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

It’s not a novel observation to say that supporters of President Donald Trump and supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders find common ground on many issues. They often share a skepticism of entrenched power and a desire to dismantle systems that they think have ceased to serve everyday people.

In Indiana, this agreement includes a distrust of data centers.

“The MAGA crowd and the Bernie bros have both figured out that they’ve been getting duped,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy nonprofit. “It was data centers that really brought it all together.”

Olson’s organization is running a campaign to persuade Indiana lawmakers to place a moratorium on new data centers and to redesign electricity rates to protect residential consumers from rate increases related to data center development.

He has received an emphatic response, with groups from the left, right and in-between booking him for speaking engagements and offering their assistance.

Election results last week confirm a similar dynamic in much of the country. Democrats won races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for two open seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, campaigns in which data centers and rising electricity costs were issues. Media outlets noted this pattern, including in an insightful report from Jael Holzman of Heatmap and a look ahead to next year’s elections from Marc Levy and Jesse Bedayn of the Associated Press.

Much of the discussion is about data centers, which are often large developments used to support cloud computing or artificial intelligence. But the underlying issues are broader, touching on the power of tech companies. For people who live near proposed data centers, there is an additional sense of powerlessness, which Inside Climate News has documented across the country, including the backlash to a plan for a huge data center in Bessemer, Alabama.

“It’s about big tech,” Olson said. “To steal Bernie’s words, [it’s about] these big tech oligarchs that are calling all the shots at every single level of government right now.”

I also see some similarities with local opposition to large wind and solar projects, a subject I’ve written a lot about over the years. A common theme is that residents feel frustrated when powerful companies want to make changes that would alter local landscapes.

Olson said he agrees that there is some overlap between opposition to data centers and large renewable energy development, but he views the latter as more of a rural phenomenon, while concern about data centers is rising almost everywhere.

Google scrapped its plans for a large data center in Indianapolis in September amid local backlash. In northwest Indiana, residents in the small city of Hobart have organized to oppose two data centers, raising concerns about the projects’ electricity and water consumption.

It’s notable that the opposition tends to highlight concerns about high electricity bills, but doesn’t talk as much about data centers’ negative climate impacts. Indiana can see the ramifications as officials push to delay the retirement of coal-fired power plants so the state can meet an expected surge in electricity demand, driven, in part, by data centers.

Political candidates can harness this mounting opposition and data center companies will need to devote more resources to engaging with the public.

Vivek Shastry, a senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told me that it’s important for the AI and data center industries to find ways to provide local benefits to host communities and to minimize any negative effects on household electricity costs.

He touched on these subjects in a recent blog post, co-written with his colleague Diana Hernández. When I read this, my first thought was, “Wait, there are local benefits?”

He explained that there are opportunities in terms of energy and money. He pointed to examples in Denmark and Finland of data centers harnessing their waste heat to contribute to district heating systems for local communities.

Beyond that—which I think would be a challenge to do in the United States—he said AI and data center developers can make community benefits part of their proposals. This could mean working with local leaders to find ways to address local needs through philanthropy.

“To the extent that there is a partnership with communities, and there are these pathways to enable tangible co-benefits,” he said.

The opposite can also be true, with local communities feeling like they are bearing the burden of a data center with few, if any, benefits.

Shastry’s larger point is that government officials and corporate leaders need to make sure that development does not harm the most vulnerable consumers by driving up costs of water and electricity. To do otherwise would feed into consumer unrest.

“It’s important to get those processes and protections right early on, because the pace of this growth is such that once you lock into certain kinds of rates and other pathways, it then becomes harder to reverse,” Shastry said.

Voters are already getting upset about electricity rate increases that they blame on data centers, even though the AI industry is in its infancy. The negative effects, if left to fester, could get much worse.

But there also is evidence that state officials have a sense of the challenge before them. The NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University shows this in its most recent quarterly report, the 50 States of Power Decarbonization.

From July to September, state regulators or legislators took 55 actions in 29 states related to laws or rules for large electricity users, which were usually motivated by the growth of data centers.

Some highlights:

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved a proposal from the utility American Electric Power to create a new rate category for data centers that have electricity demand of at least 25 megawatts. Businesses in this category have special requirements, including that they must sign a 12-year contract. The practical effect is that data centers that close or use much less power than planned will still need to pay, which can help to shield other customers from covering the costs of lines and other infrastructure built to serve these large projects.

Florida Power & Light, a utility, entered into a settlement with other parties in a rate case that includes new rate categories for large power users such as data centers. The rates would cover new projects that need at least 50 megawatts, with provisions requiring companies to pay even if they use less power than planned. The Office of Public Counsel has said the settlement is “disproportionately favorable” to corporate interests.

In Delaware, the Public Service Commission staff and the Division of the Public Advocate jointly requested that the utility, Delmarva Power and Light, institute a new rate category for customers that need at least 25 megawatts. Delmarva responded by saying it would like the commission to hold a hearing on the subject.

As recently as two years ago, there was almost no activity in this policy area. Next year at this time, I expect to see action in nearly every state.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

IEA Report Points to Oil Peak and Continuing Renewables Surge, But Trump Has Hurt Progress: The world remains on track to reach peak oil in about 2030 if countries stick to their stated policies, according to the new edition of the World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency. But this outlook is worse for the climate than the one issued last year, due in large part to changes in climate policy by President Donald Trump, as my colleague Blanca Begert reports. One key difference is that the drop-off from the peak would be more gradual than the agency had previously indicated. The peak and ensuing decline in fossil fuels would be driven by the rapid growth of carbon-free electricity sources such as wind and solar.

How the Trump Administration Is Seeking to Gut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The Trump administration is proposing a $0 budget for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, underscoring how far the office has fallen since it was a key part of planning for the country’s energy future, as Maria Gallucci reports for Canary Media. The office, which is part of the Department of Energy, was created by Congress in 2021 and received $27 billion to fund projects to scale up clean energy technologies. The sudden shift in funding priorities is ceding leadership to other countries, especially China, and is baffling to people who were connected to the office.

Sunrun Reports a Quadrupling of Participation in Virtual Power Plants: Sunrun, the rooftop solar and battery company, said 106,000 of its customers are now participating in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs, which is an increase of more than 400 percent from a year ago, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. Sunrun also said its business model, which encourages solar leasing and monthly subscription fees, positions the company to maintain growth even after an expected sales cliff in the rooftop solar industry when federal tax credits expire at the end of the year.

Green Steelmaking Advocates Look for Paths Forward Without U.S. Government Support: The Trump administration’s policies are reducing support for green steelmaking, leading companies and advocates to figure out how to maintain momentum in the short run, as my colleague Kiley Bense reports. The Ohio River Valley Institute, a nonprofit that promotes economic growth and clean energy in Appalachia, issued a report summarizing the effects of federal actions, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s phaseout of a tax credit for clean hydrogen in 2027 rather than the previous 2032. Despite the setbacks, companies are still moving forward with plans to use hydrogen to produce steel, including a plant in Louisiana being built by Hyundai.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/citypulse/original/20250523-131120-699-city_pulse_generic_og_image.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 21:59:23.445485

This power offsets more energy use of 1.5 billion iPhone users worldwide, as well as Mac Pros and Apple Watches, which together account for almost one-third of Apple's carbon footprint.

The solar farms will be spread out across Europe in Greece, Latvia, Spain, Poland, Romania, and Italy. Currently, more than 90% of Apple's manufacturing in China is powered by renewable energy, and it will also invest $150 million to raise that percentage further.

A notable fact about this news is that Apple has announced it on all of its international websites but not on its U.S. press site, potentially to avoid drawing attention or backlash from the Trump Administration, which has ended multiple clean energy projects and removed incentives.

Apple earned almost $400 billion in revenue from iPhones alone in 2024, according to Business of Apps. As one of the most profitable businesses in the world and one with a high carbon footprint, its energy offset is an incredible step toward reducing that.

Apple's goal is to power 100% of its products with clean energy by 2030. This sets a stellar example for other companies around the world to do the same. Its investment also helps lower the overall cost of solar and wind power, as their prevalence increases, making it more affordable for everyone.

Fossil fuels, also known as dirty energy, are non-renewable and expected to deplete over the next 30 to 60 years, according to Investopedia. Exposure to these fuels in our air can also cause respiratory issues, such as asthma and lung cancer, and stroke.

When Apple products finally become solar-powered, solar panels are the ultimate home energy upgrade, as they can reduce your electricity bill to as little as $0. TCD-vetted service EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes in your area, potentially saving homeowners up to $10,000 per installation. Solar also makes other energy-saving devices cheaper to run, including a heat pump, which Mitsubishi can help you find to suit your household's needs.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Apple-solar-investmentimage-recCZ8HSO7yXP3AmE-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 19:59:25.778051

Welcome back to the Pfluger Fly-By, a roundup of events and updates to keep you informed about everything I’m doing week by week to represent you in Congress.

This week, I was back in Washington to reopen the government after six weeks of Democrats’ obstruction and harmful political theatrics to keep it closed. Throughout the entire shutdown, my team and I worked diligently to ensure constituents in every corner of Texas-11 had the resources needed to navigate the chaos and care for their families. Now, I am ready and eager to get back to governing in Washington to continue delivering on the mandate we were given by the American people last November.

Below, you’ll find photos and highlights from the week, plus information on how my office can assist you with any federal concerns. As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Best,

The Longest Government Shutdown in History is Over

While I am thankful the government is finally reopened, I am painfully aware of the impact it has had on communities in Texas-11 and across America. It is important to remember that both the shutdown and the pain it inflicted were entirely preventable.

Weeks ago, I did the responsible thing and voted to keep the government open with a clean, nonpartisan continuing resolution (CR). This was the same CR that Democrats supported 13 times under President Biden. Yet this time under President Trump, nearly every single House and Senate Democrat changed their vote, shutting the government down and hurting American families in the process.

For more than six weeks, Democrats proceeded to hold our country hostage over demands for taxpayer-funded health care for illegal aliens and trillions in wasteful spending. The irony is that, despite all their threats and lies, we are still in the same place with the same deal we had on day one of the shutdown. Democrats gained nothing because Republicans stayed united and refused to cave to the Democrats’ radical demands to waste your hard-earned taxpayer dollars.

This week, on November 12, 2025, we passed the same clean CR to open the government that we passed weeks ago, funding critical programs like WIC, SNAP, and Child Nutrition, paying federal workers, service members, and air traffic controllers, and supporting veterans’ health care and benefits. Yet once again, the majority of House and Senate Democrats voted against it. Thankfully, the political pressure from their own party did not prevent a few reasonable Democrats from coming to the table this week and voting to reopen the government.

Now that President Trump has signed the CR and the government is open, federal workers will begin receiving back pay, specialized training at Goodfellow Air Force Base and Fort Hood will resume, small business loans will resume being approved, and airports will return to full staffing ahead of the busy holiday travel season.

As I mentioned earlier, I am ready and eager to get back to governing in Washington to continue delivering on the mandate we were given by the American people last November. If you have questions about the government reopening, especially if you were impacted by the shutdown, please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office.

Reimbursing Texas for Biden’s Border Crisis

Today, I was proud to lead the entire Republican Texas congressional delegation alongside U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) in a letter to the U.S. Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS), urging them to prioritize the State of Texas when disbursing the $13.5 billion in border security reimbursements I helped secure earlier this year.

The devastating impact of the previous administration’s open border policies has been felt nationwide—but no state has carried the burden more than Texas. Texas spent $11.1 billion on border security, including $5.87 billion on personnel costs and $4.75 billion on border wall and barriers. When the federal government failed to secure our border and protect our communities, Texans stepped up. We will not rest until Texas is paid for what it’s owed.

EPA Grants Texas Primacy Over Class VI Wells

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it was granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells. Under the previous administration, the permitting process for Class VI wells was painfully slow. I am grateful that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recognized this and placed his confidence in state experts who know their geology and how to support it in the best way possible.

Far too often, bureaucratic red tape gets in the way of those who know the energy industry best, stifling production and disincentivizing innovation. I introduced legislation alongside my colleague Congressman Dan Crenshaw (TX-02) to expedite state approval of these wells. Texas leads the way in efficient energy production nationwide, and we intend to keep it that way.

Southern Border Apprehensions Hit Lowest in Half a Century

This week, the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security released its latest “Border Brief” factsheet, detailing that apprehensions by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol hit record lows in half a century for Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. After four years of the Biden-Harris Administration’s disastrous open-border agenda and reckless catch-and-release policies, I am thankful the American people are finally seeing a return to law and order at our southern border.

Thanks to the strong leadership of the Trump Administration, our borders and our homeland are more secure today than they have been in years. House Republicans have also delivered real solutions at the border by passing legislation that invests in cutting-edge technology, modernizes critical equipment, and expands the Border Patrol workforce to protect the homeland from nefarious actors. I look forward to continuing this mission on the House Homeland Security Committee and building on this historic success to keep our borders and communities safe for years to come.

State of Texas Files for Rural Health Transformation Fund

I am thrilled to support the State of Texas’s application to receive funding from the newly announced $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, made possible through the historic Working Families Tax Cuts Act that I proudly voted for earlier this year.

The funding in this program will provide significant support to rural hospitals and health care providers in Texas by equipping them with the necessary equipment and resources to deliver vital care to patients in need. This is critical, as many of my constituents often have to drive long distances to see health care providers in larger cities rather than where they live. While this is merely an inconvenience for routine check-ups, it is a serious issue when unexpected medical emergencies occur, and time is of the essence.

A Note to Jodey Arrington

This week, Jodey Arrington announced he will not be seeking reelection for Texas’s 19th Congressional District. Below is the note I released on social media in response:

My friend and fellow West Texan, it has been an honor to serve alongside you in Congress – fighting together to bring Texas values to Washington.

No one has fought harder or led with more conviction than Jodey Arrington. As Chairman of the House Budget Committee, Jodey played a pivotal role in delivering the Working Families Tax Cuts. This major victory will significantly benefit countless families, workers, and small business owners across West Texas and will be a cornerstone of his legacy.

For nearly a decade, Jodey has served the 19th Congressional District with unwavering dedication and has been an outspoken leader for our West Texas way of life. I am truly going to miss Jodey’s leadership – and, more importantly, his friendship – in the halls of Congress.

IESO project manager Aaron Long told CBC News they’ll drill deeper than most residential wells, tapping into separate aquifers.
He said the plant operator would help find a remedy if wells are impacted.","Nova Scotia’s energy operator visited Pictou County this week to get local feedback on its pitch to build a new natural gas power plant — or two — in rural parts of the county.

The response was varied, with some putting their full support behind a project that they see as a fix to an unreliable energy grid and a job generator. Others are pushing back, concerned the operations will drain groundwater reserves and disrupt their bucolic lifestyle.

The Independent Energy System Operator, or IESO, has said it needs the fast-acting power generators to replace coal-fired power plants, which have to be retired by 2030. Plus, it said it needs a backup power source to prevent outages as more wind and solar power comes online.

Put another way, wind and solar plants produce energy intermittently, and the grid needs fast-acting backup power to fill in the gaps.

“I think it's a great thing,” local resident John McLeod said in an interview at one of the IESO’s public information sessions this week.

The IESO hosted sessions in Salt Springs and Marshdale, where the plants might be built. The sites were identified because of their proximity to an existing natural gas pipeline and power lines.

McLeod said he sees the project as necessary for improving the power grid, and an economic boon for Pictou County.

“That's a plus here because you don't [have] many jobs being created here in this area,” he said.

The IESO says each plant could create between 100 and 125 jobs during construction and between 10 and 15 jobs during operations.

But Holly Irons, another local resident, said she’s disappointed and worried.

“I don’t want it,” said Irons, who lives about a kilometre from the proposed site in Salt Springs, in an interview at the same session.

Water usage

Her primary concern is that the project will impact her well. The IESO says a 300-megawatt fast-acting generator requires a volume of water that’s equivalent to what’s used by 750 average rural households.

IESO project manager Aaron Long told CBC News they’ll drill deeper than most residential wells, tapping into separate aquifers. He said the plant operator would help find a remedy if wells are impacted.

That’s little comfort to Irons, who said she cherishes her well for its quality and reliability, even through this summer’s drought.

“I don't want the municipal water coming in to give me water while they take our beautiful well water that I love so dearly.”

The plan

The IESO is doing some preliminary work on the projects, including field work to make an application for environmental assessment by the province. It has also signed options to purchase and lease the required land. It will later hand over the reins to a private developer.

The IESO plans to open bids in the new year for a contract to build and operate the plant, or plants. Long said the winning bidder will pay the full cost of construction, which he estimates to be about $800 million for one 300-megawatt plant.

Long said he knows a project of this scale is “a big change,” for a rural community, which is why the IESO visited both proposed areas this week for open house sessions.

“The organization is committed to transparency and openness,” he said. “And that extends just beyond the regulatory sphere.”

Long said the IESO will soon set up a community liaison committee to keep an ongoing dialogue with locals.

The local MLA said he'll be keeping tabs as well.

""It's important to have events like this so people can be heard,"" said Progressive Conservative MLA Marco MacLeod. ""And I need to keep a clear line of communication open with the constituents to know why we're doing this and how we're doing this.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/f30bfad3-eb83-49c9-b665-5c6e314c2559,1763139911978/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1856%2C1044%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-15 15:00:45.305748

Artificial intelligence is driving a surge of power consumption globally. Electricity demand from AI training and services is set to grow four-fold in the next 10 years, according to BloombergNEF. Although fossil fuels are expected to fill the initial gap, power generators such as Solaria are positioning themselves to supply renewable power as large technology companies have set ambitious clean-energy goals to operate the facilities in the long-run.

Spokespeople for Solaria and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

In the European Union alone, growing data-center energy demand implies as many as 35 gigawatts of new solar capacity may be needed through 2030, according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.

That’s led energy transition stocks, including Solaria, to surge in 2025. The Madrid-based company’s shares have soared 99% for the year to date.

In Spain, where power distribution networks are nearly saturated, Solaria has already secured data center grid access for 1.2 gigawatts and has about 3 gigawatts in clean-energy assets operating or under construction, as well as about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) of networks.

The company signed a memorandum of understanding in 2024 with Japan’s Datasection Inc. to build a data center with a capacity of as much as 200 megawatts in its plant in Puertollano.

The agreement entailed the construction of an AI facility in an area as large as 100,000 square meters (1,076,000 sq feet). The plant is equipped with highly insulated clean rooms, once used to make photo-voltaic cells, that would be adapted to house the technological component of the data centers.

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute.
Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.","Global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,"" said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you're trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn't make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

""And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people's behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. ""Most people don’t even realize they’re there.""

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they're protesting or backing. If you like what they're doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn't much you can do about it. ""I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,"" he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

‘When finance flows, ambition grows’ Despite billions invested worldwide in clean energy, resilience and just transitions, Mr. Stiell said the total volume remains “neither sufficient nor predictable enough,” and not equitably shared.","At every negotiation table and in every diplomatic statement lies a stark truth shared by nations on the front lines of the climate crisis: without funding, there is no path to safety, justice, or survival.

Many urgent actions are required to secure a livable planet and protect millions of lives. But all of them – every breakthrough, every shield of resilience – depend on one essential driver: financing.

On Saturday, discussions at the UN climate change conference, as the annual COPs are formally known, revolved around financial mobilization, or what leaders called the engine of climate transition.

A question of survival

Convening the Third High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance, COP30 heard from representatives of nations deeply affected by climate impacts, many of whom described access to financial resources as “a matter of survival.”

UN General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock said in her opening remarks that COP30 should mark the beginning of implementing up to $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance – disbursements that “reach those most in need, quickly, transparently and fairly.”

She stressed that climate action and social justice are “inseparable,” noting:

“Climate insecurity fuels hunger and poverty, poverty drives migration and conflict; and conflict, in turn, deepens poverty and deters investment.”

Breaking this vicious cycle, she said, is essential to deliver on global climate goals.

Renewable energy takes the lead

Reflecting on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, Ms. Baerbock recalled that in 2015, many delegates had been moved to tears by the historic outcome that produced the first legally binding global climate treaty, involving more than 190 countries.

She noted that at the time, renewable energy was widely considered “unrealistic.” Today, it is the fastest-growing energy source on Earth.

In 2024, global investment in clean energy reached $2 trillion – about $800 billion more than in fossil fuels. Solar power has become the cheapest form of electricity in history.

Africa’s untapped potential

Yet Ms. Baerbock warned that “vast potential remains untapped because capital is still not flowing to where it is most needed,” particularly in Africa.

More than 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity, even though the continent’s renewable energy potential is 50 times greater than the world’s projected electricity demand for 2040.

She urged developed nations to fulfill their technological and financial commitments and to advance reform of global financial institutions.

The ‘lifeblood’ of climate action

UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell also addressed the meeting, underscoring the transformative power of climate finance.

He described finance as the “lifeblood of climate action,” capable of turning “plans into progress” and “ambition into implementation.”

Mr. Stiell stressed that the most vulnerable countries continue to face major challenges, accessing funds that have long been pledged.

‘When finance flows, ambition grows’

Despite billions invested worldwide in clean energy, resilience and just transitions, Mr. Stiell said the total volume remains “neither sufficient nor predictable enough,” and not equitably shared.

At COP30, the world is looking for proof that climate cooperation delivers.

“Real finance, flowing fast and fair, is central to that proof,” he said, urging delegates to not only demonstrate that climate cooperation is working, but that investments made now can shape the “growth story of the 21st century.”

“We are doing aquifer sustainability related research,” said Mark Hamilton, the executive director of aquifer management services at the Edwards Aquifer Authority.

Hamilton has worked for the authority for two decades.

“Working on this now almost five years,” Hamilton said. “And we feel like we have some of the best drought related data you could hope to have.”

In 2019, the aquifer acquired a property in northeast San Antonio where they focus on environmental research inside a 151-acre field research park.

“A lot of our work is based on improving soil health so that the soil will soak in more water,” Hamilton said. “It will hold more water. And it also provides a benefit to the ecosystem.”

Sustainability manger Thomas Marsalia says while some data is collected electronically, some — like soil samples — is collected manually.

Researchers are working to slow, sink and spread water runoff so that unnecessary debris won’t enter the creek.

“Giving nature a nudge in the right direction if you will,” Hamilton said. “Let it do what it already wants to do. So, we’re just trying to help.”

The Edwards Aquifer supplies water for 2 million people across Central Texas. The work being done at the research park is an effort to better preserve that resource.

Hamilton says healthy grasses and trees are like anchors to stabilize the soil — important even in a drought to maintain the aquifer.

“When this creek floods, if we don’t have this vegetation, you can imagine all of this soil is just going to get washed away,” Hamilton said.

Marsalia says man-made, one-rock dams are designed to slow down water and stabilize the soil.

“Just two rain events they’re almost covered up already,” Marsalia said. “In which a lot of this sediment would have just washed downstream if it weren’t for these structures.”

Preservation is a team effort. The experiments worked on in the field are all explained inside the Education Outreach Center, where families can learn about the aquifer’s conservation efforts for free.

“We can’t have really clean water and abundant water also without having healthy land,” Marsalia said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/EAA_crop,N,,2025-11-15 19:01:40.265728

This editorial is based on “Gauging the costs for clean energy transition” which was published in The Hindu Business Line on 10/11/2025. The article brings into picture the affordability of the clean energy transition for emerging economies, requiring just $121 billion by 2030, with India leading at $57 billion to raise renewables to 63% of capacity amid sharply falling solar, wind, and battery costs.

For Prelims: India’s clean energy transition,India’s COP26 commitment, International Energy Agency, National Green Hydrogen Mission, International Solar Alliance, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, Green Bonds, Critical minerals, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)

For Mains: Major Milestones in India’s Transition Towards Renewable Energy, Major Challenges Hindering India’s Renewable Energy Transition.

A new study reveals that the clean energy transition for emerging economies is far more affordable than previously thought. Between 2024 and 2030, nine major G20 emerging markets will need just $121 billion in climate finance for power generation, merely the incremental cost above business-as-usual investments. India leads this transformation, requiring $57 billion to boost its renewable share from 45% to 63% of installed capacity. Dramatically falling costs of solar, wind, and battery storage down 83%, 42%, and 90% respectively since 2010, have made this transition economically viable. For India specifically, while fossil-fuel power investments will decline by $43 billion, renewable spending must increase by $90 billion, positioning the country at the forefront of the green energy revolution with the largest climate finance requirement among emerging economies.

What are the Major Milestones in India’s Transition Towards Renewable Energy?

Surpassing the Non-Fossil Fuel Capacity Goal Ahead of Time: India has already achieved its COP26 commitment to have 50% of its installed electricity generation capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, showcasing exceptional policy effectiveness and rapid execution.

This early achievement demonstrates a decoupling of energy growth from carbon-intensive sources, providing strong global confidence in India's net-zero 2070 pathway and enabling further ambitious clean energy targets.

As of September 2025, the installed non-fossil capacity has crossed 250 GW, representing over 50% of the country's total power capacity, successfully meeting the 2030 target five years early.

Global Leadership in Solar Capacity and Manufacturing Growth: Solar energy is the central pillar of the energy transition, and India is asserting itself as a global solar powerhouse through massive capacity addition and domestic manufacturing support.

The success of national schemes and low tariffs, driven by reverse auctions, makes solar the most cost-competitive and rapidly deployable source of new power generation, reducing the need for imported fuel.

India's cumulative solar capacity has reached around 130 GW (as of October 2025), and domestic solar module manufacturing capacity has nearly doubled from 38 GW to 74 GW in FY 2024–25, driven by the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.

Launch of the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM): The launch of the National Green Hydrogen Mission marks India's aggressive move to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like fertilizers, refining, and heavy industries, shifting the focus beyond just the power sector.

The mission establishes a comprehensive ecosystem for green hydrogen production and utilization, positioning India as a potential global hub for green hydrogen export, which is crucial for long-term energy security.

The mission targets developing a Green Hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) per annum by 2030, which is expected to attract over ₹8 lakh crore in total investments.

Decentralization of Renewable Energy through Rooftop Solar Schemes: A major shift is the focus on democratizing power generation, moving beyond large utility-scale projects to empower households and farmers as producers of clean energy.

The widespread adoption of decentralized solar, particularly rooftop and agricultural pumping, significantly reduces transmission losses, enhances grid resilience, and directly impacts consumer's electricity bills.

The PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched in February 2024 with a ₹75,021 crore outlay, targets rooftop solar installations in one crore households.

Financial Incentives for Energy Storage: Recognizing the intermittency challenge of solar and wind, the government has prioritized energy storage, including Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and pumped storage projects (PSP), to achieve a Round-the-Clock (RTC) reliable power supply.

The introduction of targeted financial mechanisms is essential to bridge the current cost gap, making storage projects viable and facilitating high penetration of variable renewables into the grid.

The Cabinet has approved a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for BESS, in September 2023 with an initial allocation to support the development of 4,000 MWh of BESS projects.

Advancing into the Frontier of Offshore Wind Energy: To diversify the renewable mix and exploit vast untapped potential, India is strategically moving into the high-capacity factor, higher-cost domain of offshore wind, which requires substantial government support.

This pioneering step opens a new vector for clean energy, especially along the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, simultaneously catalyzing a new domestic manufacturing and supply chain for large turbines and structures.

The government recently approved a VGF scheme of ₹7,453 crore for India's first 1 GW of offshore wind projects, targeting a potential of 30 GW by 2030.

What are the Major Challenges Hindering India’s Renewable Energy Transition?

Grid Instability and Curtailment due to Low Storage Capacity: The core challenge is the intermittency of solar and wind power, which is severely restricted by the lack of sufficient grid-scale energy storage and the inflexibility of traditional coal power plants.

This mismatch between daytime supply and evening demand forces operators to curtail or waste clean energy, undermining the economic viability of new projects and necessitating fossil fuel use during peak hours.

Recent data shows solar power curtailment rates in some regions rose to as high as 12% in late 2025, and on certain days, up to 40% of solar output was denied access to the grid due to oversupply, proving that capacity addition is outpacing grid readiness.

Pervasive Counterparty Risk and Financial Distress of DISCOMs: The financial health of state-owned Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) poses the single largest credit risk to renewable power developers, stemming from delayed payments for procured electricity.

These poor financials are rooted in high Transmission & Distribution (T&D) losses, poor billing/collection efficiency, and unrecovered costs due to subsidized tariffs, driving up the overall Cost of Debt for clean energy projects.

Also, Many distribution companies require 8 to 17 months of payment support to achieve a viable credit rating.

Deep Reliance on Imported Components and Raw Materials: Despite ambitious 'Make in India' and PLI schemes, the renewable energy supply chain, especially for solar and battery storage, remains heavily dependent on imports for crucial upstream components and critical minerals.

This import dependency exposes the sector to geopolitical risks, currency fluctuation, and global supply chain disruptions, threatening the long-term goal of energy sovereignty.

According to CEEW, India continues to rely heavily on imports of solar modules and lithium-ion batteries, with China accounting for nearly 80% of its battery imports in 2023.

Need for Massive and Affordable Climate Finance Mobilization: The transition requires colossal cumulative investment, and the domestic financial ecosystem, despite positive steps like Green Bonds, still lacks the depth and long-term, low-cost capital needed for capital-intensive, high-risk, emerging technologies like Green Hydrogen and Offshore Wind.

Without innovative blended finance and risk-sharing mechanisms, the cost of capital will remain high, making the transition significantly more expensive than planned.

To achieve its Net-Zero 2070 target, India is estimated to require $10 trillion in cumulative investments, yet it faces a huge long-term financing gap of approximately $3.5 trillion that must be bridged by external and innovative capital.

Regulatory and Contractual Inconsistencies Across States: The renewable energy framework is often hampered by inconsistent policy implementation and retroactive changes at the state level, creating significant regulatory uncertainty for investors and developers.

Ambiguities in areas like curtailment compensation, land acquisition rules, and Green Open Access implementation lead to prolonged legal disputes and deter much-needed long-term private investment.

Recent reports show that Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies have issued Letters of Award (LoAs) for over 43 GW of capacity where Power Sale Agreements (PSAs) with end procurers remained unsigned, reflecting market misalignment and uncertainty regarding project execution.

Land Acquisition Concern and End-of-Life Waste Management: The transition to utility-scale renewable energy is highly land-intensive, creating unavoidable conflicts over land use—often leading to the displacement of communities, diversion of grazing/agricultural land, and contentious land acquisition processes that raise issues of inadequate compensation, consent, and transparency.

Furthermore, the future challenge of managing e-waste from retired solar panels and batteries is a ticking environmental time bomb that requires the immediate scaling up of national recycling infrastructure to avoid future ecological damage.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India currently generates around 100,000 tonnes of solar waste, but by 2030 this figure could swell to 600,000 tonnes.

Critical Shortage of a Skilled Green Workforce and Training Mismatch: Despite the promise of ""green jobs,"" the rapid scaling of the sector is severely constrained by a significant skills gap and a mismatch between academic curricula and cutting-edge industry needs.

This shortfall affects everything from highly-specialized manufacturing and R&D roles to basic project installation and maintenance, leading to project delays and sub-optimal operational efficiency.

India is projected to face a critical shortage of 1.2 million skilled workers in the renewable sector by 2030, directly impacting project timelines and costs.

Regional Disparities and Energy Access: Some regions will face far greater social and economic impacts during the clean-energy transition than others.

For example, coal-dependent states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha may experience job losses and revenue decline, while renewable-rich states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu stand to gain from increased investment and green jobs.

This uneven distribution complicates the goal of ensuring a nationally just and balanced transition.

Weak Data Governance and Transparency: Inadequate, inconsistent, or delayed energy-sector data severely limits informed policy-making and undermines efficient market functioning.

The absence of real-time, verified data on generation, storage, transmission capacity, and state-level transition progress reduces accountability, weakens investor confidence, and restricts the ability to design evidence-based interventions.

Also, lack of standardization and granularity provides fertile ground for ""greenwashing,"" undermines the credibility of climate commitments, and increases due diligence costs for investors trying to accurately assess portfolio-wide environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk.

What Steps Can India Take to Fast-Track Its Renewable Energy Transition?

Implement Performance-Linked Financial Discipline for DISCOMs: Financial viability of Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) must be secured through a non-negotiable performance-based funding model, moving away from past bailout failures.

This requires a strict, enforced linkage of central government funding (like RDSS) to tangible, measurable reductions in Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses, full cost-reflective tariffs, and mandatory Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of subsidies.

The measure involves mandating real-time digital monitoring of loss reduction targets and strictly enforcing the Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) Rules to ensure timely payments to generating companies (GENCOs), thus dramatically reducing counterparty risk for private investors.

Establish a National Grid Flexibility Market and Storage Mandate: Treat grid flexibility and energy storage as a standalone, essential service, rather than a mere ancillary component of solar and wind projects, to incentivize rapid deployment and manage intermittency.

This requires launching a market mechanism for fast-response resources and dynamic dispatch, fully valuing the services provided by Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), Pumped Storage Projects (PSP), and gas-peaker plants.

This measure involves the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issuing a National Energy Storage Obligation (NESO) framework, replacing the current Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) system, with targets that explicitly define the MWh storage capacity required for Round-the-Clock (RTC) power.

Launch a Green Hydrogen Demand Creation Mandate: To realize the ambitious Green Hydrogen Mission, the government must strategically create anchor demand by mandating blending quotas in key high-carbon industries, providing the crucial offtake certainty needed for massive project financing.

This policy signal de-risks early investments in large-scale electrolyser manufacturing and downstream infrastructure, accelerating cost decline curves through guaranteed economies of scale.

The measure involves notifying a mandatory Green Hydrogen consumption quota for core ""hard-to-abate"" sectors, starting with fertilizer production, petroleum refining, and steel, alongside Viability Gap Funding (VGF) schemes targeted specifically at early commercial-scale Green Ammonia export facilities.

Enable Virtual Net Metering and Decentralized Energy Trading: Rooftop solar growth must transition from individual house installations to a community-wide, virtual model to overcome physical rooftop limitations and fully leverage the potential of distributed generation across urban areas.

This requires enabling regulatory frameworks for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading and Virtual Net Metering (VNM) across multiple locations owned by one entity or within cooperative societies.

The measure involves the Ministry of Power (MoP) amending the Green Open Access Rules to allow aggregated VNM for commercial and residential complexes, incentivizing land-constrained entities to invest in off-site or shared community solar projects, drastically increasing the urban adoption rate.

Create Single-Window Mega-Site Clearances for RE Zones: Long-standing delays in land acquisition, Right-of-Way (ROW), and inter-state transmission clearances remain the biggest execution bottleneck, necessitating a radical simplification of the permitting process.

A dedicated, fast-track mechanism for nationally significant projects would cut down the time from tender award to commissioning, dramatically improving project execution timelines.

This measure involves establishing ""Renewable Energy Investment Zones (REIZ)"" with pre-cleared land banks, pre-approved environmental permits, and a Single Project Clearance Board comprising Central and State representatives, reducing the average project approval cycle from over 18 months to less than 6 months.

Upskill Human Capital through Specialized Green Technology Institutes: Current engineering and vocational training pipeline is insufficient for the demands of highly technical, next-generation renewable technologies like high-efficiency TOPCon cells, large-scale BESS deployment, and offshore wind maintenance.

A coordinated national effort to create a specialized workforce is essential for sustained growth and true self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat).

The measure involves launching a National Green Skill Development Mission to create Centres of Excellence (CoEs) in partnership with industry leaders, focusing on Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, Green Hydrogen plant operations, and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) deployment and data analytics.

Mandate Retrofit Flexibility in Existing Coal Power Fleet: The argument is that instead of outright immediate retirement, a cost-effective and immediate strategy for grid stability is to mandate technical retrofits (e.g., boiler modifications) in the existing coal power fleet to enable flexible operation and two-shift cycling capability.

This ensures that traditional plants can ramp up and down quickly to support high variable Renewable Energy (RE) penetration, effectively serving as a synthetic energy storage solution until BESS costs decline further.

The measure involves the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) issuing new technical standards that make flexible operation mandatory for all thermal power plants older than 15 years, penalizing plants that fail to meet minimum ramp rates and offering incentives for fast part-load operation.

Accelerate Bioenergy Deployment Across Sectors: Bioenergy provides both waste-management solutions and clean energy. India can scale up by:

Converting agricultural residues (e.g., crop stubble) and municipal solid waste into energy, reducing pollution while generating power

Producing liquid biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel to decarbonize road transport

Expanding gaseous biofuels such as Compressed Biogas (CBG) under initiatives like SATAT for use in vehicles, shipping, and aviation. This supports circular economy goals and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.

Deepen International Collaboration and Cross-Border Energy Cooperation: India’s leadership in global platforms must be leveraged further:

International Solar Alliance (ISA), Mission Innovation, and India’s climate leadership during G20 have positioned India as both a provider and recipient of green technology and finance

Strengthen regional electricity trade with ASEAN, SAARC, BIMSTEC, and emerging green hydrogen partnerships with the Middle East

Promote joint R&D, battery storage innovation, and low-cost finance through multilateral cooperation. This accelerates technology diffusion and lowers financing costs.

Promote Community Participation and Gender Inclusion: A people-centric transition ensures long-term success. This includes: Community ownership models, local co-operatives, and revenue-sharing frameworks for solar and wind projects

Gender-focused interventions that increase women’s workforce participation, leadership roles, and access to green livelihood opportunities.

Such measures build trust, improve adoption rates, and make energy transitions socially sustainable.

Towards Just Transition: India must ensure that coal-dependent states and vulnerable workers are not left behind. This includes: Reskilling and redeployment of coal-sector workers, diversifying state economies (e.g., Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha)

Without a just transition, rapid shifts may trigger social resistance, widening regional inequalities.

Even well-intentioned policies—such as the E20 fuel policy or Delhi’s vehicle scrappage policy—risk backlash if introduced without adequate preparedness, supply-chain readiness, or public awareness.

India must ensure phased rollouts, stakeholder consultations, infrastructure readiness, and affordability safeguards to avoid disrupting livelihoods and mobility.

Conclusion:

India’s renewable energy transition stands at a decisive inflection point driven by technological advances, strong policy backing, and falling costs. Yet, realizing its full potential demands financial innovation, institutional reforms, and grid modernization. Accelerating this shift will not only secure energy independence but also generate green jobs and inclusive growth. Aligned with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), India’s transition embodies the path toward a sustainable and resilient future.

Buying electric vehicles from the end of September and on will no longer net you any tax breaks at the end of the year.","Products rise and fall like the changing tides of the sea. Some go away, new ones launch — it's a never-ending dance between manufacturers and consumers that touches nearly every industry, including automotive. Vehicles can get phased out because they don't sell well, new or improved models become available, or something else entirely, like the parent company going under. In any case, there are a host of electric vehicles on the market this year that look like they won't be around for much longer, and certainly not in 2026.

If you're interested in owning one, you might want to hurry up and order, funds willing, because once they're gone, they're probably gone for good. Depending on how much used stock is available, that may or may not be an exaggeration. It depends on the market and how in demand these vehicles truly are.

Just to provide a few quick examples, some electric vehicles that are already gone, but not forgotten, include the Ford Focus Electric, Ford Ranger EV, Fiat 500e, BMW i3 (here's what happened), Toyota RAV4 EV, and Chevrolet S-10 EV (here are 13 EVs that have been discontinued in the U.S.). As for the electric vehicles that won't make it to 2026, here are five others that will make a few folks wince.

In September 2025, Acura officially announced that the ZDX, its first electric vehicle, would be discontinued. Part of the reason is because of slow EV adoption across the board, causing some automakers to backtrack on EVs. The electric model of the ZDX debuted in 2024, just a year prior to its cancellation. While not necessarily a standout in its class, the Acura ZDX is capable and enjoys a roomy interior. It features good fuel economy ratings (for an EV, anyway), with 313 miles per charge estimated for the rear-wheel-drive version and 278 miles per charge for the all-wheel-drive model. (The real-world results are lower for the all-wheel-drive model, according to Car and Driver's test of the vehicle.) Of course, if you know what you're doing, you can extend your electric vehicle's range in a few ways, hybrid or all-electric included. That could help eke out a little more range out of something like the Acura ZDX EV.

The ZDX EV was a suitable alternative to the Chevy Equinox, though a bit pricier than some of the other options in its class. That may change now that it's being discontinued, especially when it comes to used and pre-owned models. It remains to be seen how or if the discontinuation will change demand going forward. For now, it's worth noting that if you've been looking into the ZDX, you might want to pull the trigger soon. Or, you could wait until prices drop and dealerships are clearing out excess stock.

Dodge unveiled the Ram 1500 REV, an all-electric full-sized truck, in 2023, but it never quite made it to market. After several delays, Ram officially cancelled plans in September 2025, which means its rendition of a supercharged electric truck will never see the light of day. According to the company, it did so because of the slow demand for EVs in North America, but it's entirely likely the hassle wasn't worth the investment in the end. Consumer reports show that EV trucks are among some of the least reliable on the market, after all. You won't be able to buy the Ram 1500 EV new or used — you won't even be able to buy this model at all, actually. But don't fret: If you are looking for an EV truck, the REV models are staying in production, like the plug-in hybrid Ram 1500 planned to release soon.

The all-EV model is gone, but the Ram 1500 Ramcharger is still around the corner. The extended-range hybrid has two electric motors working together to produce 663 horsepower and 615 pound-feet of torque. It also uses a liquid-cooled battery pack offering up to 141 miles per charge. But that, too, has been delayed a year — it's set to release in early 2026 — and it remains to be seen what changes or upgrades will make it into the production model. The all-electric Ram 1500, on the other hand, was only ever a concept, and that's all it will ever be now.

The Dodge Charger electric, the Daytona EV, comes in two trims for the 2025 model year, the Scat Pack and the R/T. Well, after just a year in production, Dodge is already phasing out the Daytona R/T model, leaving the would-be electric muscle drivers with just one option in 2026. While the EV model will technically still be around, which is a positive, it's sad to see some of that variety go. There are also rumors that Dodge cancelled development of another, even more powerful model called the Banshee EV. It's unfortunate to see because it's not like the muscle car EV market is flooded with options.

The model saying bye was capable of 496 horsepower, had all-wheel drive, and gave 308 miles per charge, a slightly better fuel economy than the 241 miles from the Scat Pack. No doubt the range difference is due to the higher horsepower and better performance in the Scat Pack model. Still, with a 0 to 60 miles per hour time at 4.7 seconds, the Dodge Charger Daytona R/T was impressively fast, but it didn't come close to some of the fastest electric vehicles in the world. That doesn't really matter, though — it still stings to see an EV that's fun to drive go away, even if it is only half of the model being postponed.

Launched in 2023, the Nissan Ariya EV is apparently no more. According to the automaker, production has been officially halted for the U.S. market, but Nissan did say ""paused"" and not necessarily discontinued. The company has mentioned they're reallocating resources to the Leaf EV, another electric vehicle, so it's not abandoning the technology completely. The Leaf is also going to be more accessible, with a lower planned MSRP, which could be another reason why the Ariya is being phased out.

The 2025 Nissan Ariya is a compact all-electric SUV. Drivers can expect 205 miles from the Engage e-4orce model to 289 miles per charge from the Evolve+ option, and there's plenty of room inside with five available seats. It features a handsome yet unique design inside and out. The sophisticated cabin is a stunner, which is what makes the loss of this vehicle sting a little, more so because it's only been on the market for a short while. It will be interesting to see how well-received the upcoming Nissan Leaf EV is and also how long that one stays in production versus the Ariya's short but notable run. It does seem like most manufacturers are shifting focus to hybrid models overall rather than all-electric models, likely due to market demand cooling.

The Genesis Electrified G80 was an electric car that looked nothing like an electric car. From the outside, you'd probably clock it as a luxury sedan, and that was certainly the goal. But it was also pretty expensive, starting at $77,000, up to an estimated $82,000 depending on the trim and features you choose. Maybe that's why it didn't sell as well, or maybe it's just that EVs in general aren't as exciting. Either way, Genesis announced that the Electrified model won't be returning in 2026. Initially, the company simply removed the vehicle's information from its website. It seemed like the EV would go quietly into the night, but Genesis did eventually make an announcement through the media.

What is somewhat surprising, if you can call it that, is that the Genesis Electrified G80 faithfully recreated the bulky sedan styling of its gas-powered sibling, the standard G80. People still weren't buying it. It appears consumers aren't all that interested in EVs that mimic gas counterparts well, beyond your average electric model, possibly indicating that no EVs are going to land the popular vote.

Could the EU-Serbia Lithium Agreement Signal Your Next Investment Opportunity?","Understanding the EU-Serbia Lithium Agreement Framework

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement represents a fundamental shift in Europe's approach to critical mineral security, establishing comprehensive frameworks that extend far beyond traditional extraction partnerships. This strategic alliance operates through five interconnected pillars designed to create an integrated battery materials ecosystem spanning raw material extraction, processing, manufacturing, and workforce development.

The partnership emerged under the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), which entered into force on June 14, 2024, providing the legal foundation for Europe's diversified mineral sourcing strategy. Furthermore, this initiative aligns closely with broader critical minerals energy transition strategies across the continent. The CRMA establishes a tiered approach where strategic projects receive coordinated EU institutional support, member state backing, and enhanced financing access through mechanisms including European Investment Bank loans and Innovation Fund resources.

Strategic Implementation Architecture

The agreement's operational structure integrates multiple governance layers to ensure comprehensive supply chain security. Strategic projects designated under the CRMA receive priority treatment through coordinated Commission resources, while supply chain partnerships create integrated frameworks connecting extraction to European manufacturing capabilities.

Key implementation mechanisms include:

• Value chain development for raw materials and electric vehicle integration

• Research collaboration initiatives linking Serbian geological expertise with European battery technology

• Environmental and social governance standards embedded throughout operations

• Financial instrument mobilization through EU funding programs

• Workforce development programs targeting high-quality employment opportunities

In June 2025, the European Commission officially designated Serbia's Jadar project among 13 strategic critical materials initiatives in third countries, positioning it as a cornerstone of Europe's mineral security architecture.

Serbia's Jadar Project: Technical Specifications and Market Impact

The Jadar Valley development serves as the primary driver of the EU-Serbia lithium agreement, containing an estimated 200 million tonnes of lithium-borate ore with approximately 2.4 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE). This deposit's significance stems not from absolute size but from its strategic geographic proximity to European markets and processing infrastructure.

Project Specifications and Production Capacity

Metric Value Estimated Reserves 200 million tonnes lithium-borate ore Lithium Carbonate Equivalent 2.4 million tonnes LCE Potential EU Market Share 10-15% of lithium demand Annual Production Capacity 50,000-75,000 tonnes LCE EV Production Support 1.1 million vehicles annually Projected Revenue (10 years) €4 billion Serbian Treasury Revenue €300 million

The project's 10-15% of European lithium demand translates to approximately 50,000-75,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent annually, based on current EU consumption patterns of 500,000-750,000 tonnes LCE per year. This production capacity theoretically supports 1.1 million electric vehicles annually, assuming approximately 75 kg of lithium carbonate equivalent per EV battery pack.

Technical Processing Requirements

Jadar's lithium-borate ore composition requires specialized processing methodology distinct from conventional hard-rock lithium extraction or geothermal lithium extraction techniques. The ore processing involves:

• Acid leaching of boron-containing lithium silicate formations

• Lithium hydroxide precipitation following solvent extraction

• Water consumption of approximately 500-800 gallons per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent

• Processing timeline targeting 2030-2032 commercial production commencement

Unlike lithium resources in South America's Lithium Triangle or Australian lithium innovations, Jadar offers substantially reduced transportation costs and supply chain complexity, potentially reducing final battery manufacturing costs by 8-12% compared to non-European sourcing.

Economic Impact Analysis and Benefit Distribution

Serbian officials project the EU-Serbia lithium agreement will generate approximately 20,000 new employment opportunities across the lithium value chain, encompassing direct mining operations, processing facilities, manufacturing, and supply chain support services.

Employment Distribution Analysis

The 20,000 employment figure breaks down across multiple economic sectors:

• Direct Employment: 2,000-4,000 jobs in mining and processing operations

• Indirect Employment: 6,000-8,000 jobs in supply chain support, equipment provision, and logistics

• Induced Employment: 8,000-10,000 jobs from secondary economic activity generated by wage spending

This employment multiplier effect assumes approximately 3-5 secondary jobs created per direct mining position, consistent with International Monetary Fund estimates for extractive industries in Central and Eastern European economies.

Revenue Distribution Concerns

Financial analysis reveals significant disparities in benefit distribution, with €4 billion in projected 10-year revenues generating only €300 million (7.5%) flowing to Serbian Treasury. This benefit-sharing ratio reflects patterns observed in other developing-economy mineral extraction projects, where operator profits typically represent 70-85% of total value.

The 92.5% value capture by international operators versus 7.5% to local government suggests limited Serbian negotiating leverage, particularly considering global capital requirements for large-scale lithium processing infrastructure.

Downstream Manufacturing Integration

Beyond extraction, the agreement encompasses downstream processing through partnerships including InoBat AG's battery manufacturing facility. The Slovak company committed to factory construction beginning in 2025, supported by €419 million in Serbian government subsidies.

However, battery manufacturing value chain analysis reveals:

• Raw materials: 15-20% of final cell value

• Cell production labour: 10-15% of value

• Technology licensing and IP: 40-50% of value

• Capital equipment: 15-20% of value

This distribution indicates that 80-90% of battery cell manufacturing value typically accrues to technology licensing and intellectual property holders rather than host countries.

Environmental Opposition and Water Resource Concerns

Environmental groups cite multiple technical risks associated with the EU-Serbia lithium agreement's implementation, focusing particularly on water resource protection and community displacement concerns.

Water Contamination Risk Assessment

The Jadar River valley system serves approximately 100,000-150,000 people in surrounding agricultural regions dependent on river water for irrigation and domestic consumption. Environmental opposition focuses on three specific technical risks:

1. Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)

Boron-rich lithium ore oxidation produces sulfuric acid capable of dissolving heavy metals (aluminium, iron, manganese) into groundwater systems. Without perpetual active management, AMD contamination can persist 50-100+ years post-mining operations.

2. Saline Discharge Impact

Lithium extraction produces high-salinity wastewater that, if released into freshwater aquifers, renders water unusable for agriculture due to osmotic stress effects on crop production systems.

3. Cumulative Contamination Loading

Industrial operations within 50 kilometres, including phosphate fertiliser plants and copper smelters, create compound contamination risks if lithium mining adds pollution loading to existing stressed water systems.

Aquifer Vulnerability Analysis

The Jadar Valley aquifer sits approximately 50-200 metres below surface in regions of moderate geological containment, presenting theoretical contamination risks if spillage or seepage occurs during processing operations.

Lithium processing water requirements of 500-800 gallons per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent produced raises sustainability concerns given regional water availability constraints. Consequently, proper mine reclamation innovation becomes essential for long-term environmental protection.

Permitting Process Transparency Issues

In 2021, the Serbian government revoked Rio Tinto's permits following mass protests, indicating both public opposition success and government responsiveness to pressure. This permit revocation delayed project commencement by approximately 3-4 years (2021-2024/2025 recovery phase).

Recent political developments have revived project prospects, though environmental groups continue challenging transparency in:

• Environmental baseline data availability and accessibility

• Independent verification processes separate from operator assessments

• Community consent mechanisms enabling meaningful local participation

• Adaptive management requirements with permit suspension triggers

Europe's Supply Chain Diversification Strategy

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement operates within Europe's broader strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese-controlled mineral processing and supply chains. China currently controls approximately 60-70% of global lithium processing capacity despite controlling only 15-20% of primary lithium reserves.

Strategic Diversification Mechanisms

Since 2021, the European Union has established critical materials partnerships with 14 countries, creating a diversified network including Argentina (lithium), Norway (rare earths), and Zambia (copper and cobalt). This multi-country approach operates through dual mechanisms:

1. Supply Source Diversification

Reducing reliance on single-source lithium suppliers, particularly Chile's dominance of 28-32% of global production and Australia's 50-55% of hard-rock production output.

2. Processing Repatriation

Building European battery manufacturing and lithium processing capacity to reduce Chinese value-capture dominance, as approximately 85% of lithium battery cell production currently occurs in China or China-adjacent Asian facilities.

Climate Neutrality Timeline Alignment

The partnership directly supports the EU's 2050 climate neutrality objectives established under European Climate Law (EU Regulation 2021/1119). Interim targets include:

• 2030: 55% greenhouse gas emission reduction compared to 1990 levels

• 2035: Phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicle sales

• 2040: 90% emission reduction milestone

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement provides essential materials for renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle production necessary to achieve these legally binding targets.

Governance Challenges and Democratic Oversight

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement faces significant governance challenges related to democratic oversight, transparency, and accountability mechanisms within Serbia's current political framework.

Democratic Institution Concerns

Critics argue that Serbia's governance framework lacks sufficient transparency and accountability mechanisms for responsible resource management. Concerns about rule of law, media freedom, and democratic institutions raise questions about effective oversight implementation throughout the project lifecycle.

Parliamentary Opposition Response

Serbian opposition parties have consistently challenged lithium mining through legislative channels. In September 2024, parliament rejected an opposition bill proposing a complete ban on lithium mining activities, highlighting ongoing domestic political divisions regarding the project's implementation.

The parliamentary opposition argues that the EU-Serbia lithium agreement proceeds without adequate public consultation and democratic approval processes, potentially circumventing constitutional requirements for major resource development decisions.

Institutional Capacity Questions

Effective environmental monitoring and enforcement require institutional capacity that may exceed current Serbian regulatory capabilities. Key concerns include:

• Technical expertise for ongoing environmental monitoring

• Financial resources for independent oversight operations

• Legal frameworks enabling permit suspension or modification

• International arbitration mechanisms for dispute resolution

Automotive Industry Strategic Partnerships

Major international automakers view the EU-Serbia lithium agreement as a strategic opportunity to establish integrated supply chains from extraction through vehicle production, reducing dependence on Asian supply chains.

Direct Supply Chain Integration

Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis have expressed interest in establishing direct supply agreements with Serbian lithium operations, creating vertically integrated supply chains that could provide competitive advantages in electric vehicle manufacturing costs and supply chain resilience.

These partnerships potentially enable:

• Cost reduction of 8-12% compared to non-European sourcing

• Supply security independent of geopolitical disruptions in maritime chokepoints

• Quality control through integrated processing and manufacturing systems

• Carbon footprint reduction via shortened transportation distances

Battery Technology Development

The agreement facilitates collaboration between European battery technology developers and Serbian mineral resources, potentially creating competitive advantages in next-generation battery chemistry research and development.

European automakers are particularly interested in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technologies that could utilise Jadar's specific ore composition for cost-effective energy storage solutions in mass-market electric vehicles. In addition, this collaboration aligns with broader trends in mining industry evolution towards more sustainable practices.

Balkan Geopolitical Implications

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement carries significant implications for regional power dynamics and Serbia's complex geopolitical positioning between European integration and traditional alliances with Russia and China.

EU Accession Process Considerations

The partnership raises critical questions about how resource extraction agreements interact with Serbia's EU accession negotiations. Traditional accession processes emphasise governance reform requirements, rule of law strengthening, and democratic institution building.

Some analysts worry that economic partnerships might overshadow these governance reform requirements, potentially allowing Serbia to access EU economic benefits without implementing comprehensive democratic reforms expected of membership candidates. However, critics argue this approach undermines democratic values within EU expansion strategies.

Regional Influence Dynamics

This agreement positions Serbia as a strategically important partner in Europe's green transition, potentially affecting regional relationships and Serbia's diplomatic balancing act between major powers.

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement may influence:

• Regional competition with other Balkan states seeking EU investment

• Russian influence in Serbian domestic politics and energy policy

• Chinese Belt and Road Initiative projects in the Western Balkans

• NATO relations and regional security cooperation frameworks

Long-term Strategic Positioning

Serbia's role as a critical minerals supplier could provide enhanced negotiating leverage in future EU accession discussions, while potentially creating economic dependencies that limit policy autonomy in other areas.

The agreement establishes Serbia as a strategic energy transition partner rather than merely an accession candidate, potentially altering traditional EU expansion dynamics in the Western Balkans region.

Investment and Market Psychology Considerations

The EU-Serbia lithium agreement reflects broader shifts in critical minerals investment psychology, driven by supply chain security concerns rather than purely economic optimisation considerations.

Risk Premium Calculations

European willingness to accept higher extraction costs in Serbia compared to established suppliers reflects geopolitical risk premiums increasingly incorporated into strategic planning. The agreement prioritises supply security over short-term cost minimisation, indicating fundamental shifts in resource investment criteria.

Market Timing and Cyclical Factors

Lithium market dynamics suggest the agreement's timing may coincide with supply shortage periods projected for 2026-2030, when global electric vehicle adoption could outpace production capacity increases from traditional sources.

This timing positions the EU-Serbia lithium agreement to capture premium pricing during anticipated supply constraints, potentially improving project economics beyond baseline financial projections.

Coal was first discovered in West Virginia in 1742, natural gas was first struck in 1815, and the state’s first oil-producing well was completed in 1860. Each of these discoveries happened before West Virginia was recognized as the nation’s 35th state. In fact, West Virginians were enjoying public electric streetlamps a full three years before electric lights were installed in the White House in 1891. When it comes to energy, West Virginia has always led the way.

West Virginia energy has been used to fortify our country, connect our communities with reliable infrastructure, and provide affordable electricity that Americans need and deserve across our country. This duty is part of the shared identity between West Virginians and is a central aspect of the culture and history here that has withstood the test of time. That tradition is something to be proud of, and something that Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration are committed to continuing.

West Virginians know too well the attacks that have targeted our way of life, first by President Obama and later by President Biden. These attacks sought to harm our states’ energy and infrastructure industries. Thankfully, we’ve been able to work together to right the wrongs of the Obama and Biden EPA in just the first 300 days of the Trump administration, and our visits across West Virginia this past week highlighted the impact our policies are making.

We began by hosting a roundtable discussion in Charleston with energy and manufacturing leaders who are making important investments in energy security and economic development. We’ve reached a pivotal moment for American energy and manufacturing, America’s economic backbone, and how we strengthen these industries today will shape the future of communities across the nation. In talking with industry leaders, it was clear that quick deregulatory actions by EPA this year are already making a difference.

Next, we visited the John Amos Power Plant in Winfield to see operations firsthand as coal-fired electricity generation is increasingly necessary to meet power demand. For years, we have warned about the consequences of Democrats’ “Clean Power Plan 2.0” that aimed to shut down power generation through coal and natural gas. Under President Trump’s leadership and his support for coal, EPA has begun the process of ending this reckless and unconstitutional policy, and is making needed investments in coal-fired power from states like West Virginia.

We then visited the Toyota plant in Buffalo that employs thousands of West Virginians to meet with their leadership and hear about their growth over the past year. Facilities like Toyota were under threat from the Biden administration’s EV mandate that would have banned the sale of gas-powered cars across 30% of the U.S. market, eliminating jobs and consumer choice. The good news is that we worked together to reverse this policy earlier this year and preserve employment opportunities up and down the automotive supply chain. West Virginians don’t want an EV mandate, and we’re proud to have led efforts to protect American workers and consumers from this radical and drastic policy.

Finally, we traveled to Apple Grove and visited Nucor Steel as they move toward becoming fully operational. Nucor Steel is vital to manufacturing in West Virginia and has already made a major economic impact. Nucor also provides an important perspective on our country’s broken permitting and environmental review process, as lengthy delays and red tape nearly halted the facility’s construction. The Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have made permitting reform a central priority and continue to work to reform this burdensome process while ensuring our environment continues to be protected.

Our visits displayed directly how early successes and policies we’re working on in Washington are making a difference in West Virginia. Our country needs to be able to build again, we need to be able to generate reliable and affordable electricity, and we must be able to invest in our communities. Together, the EPA and the EPW Committee are working to unleash American energy, spur economic development, and create good-paying jobs while always protecting the air, land, and water of our communities.

While this is a great start, more work remains to be done, and we’ll continue to work for West Virginians and Americans across our great nation.

Chattanooga is home to heavy equipment manufacturers like Astec and Miller Industries and a hub for logistics. Manufacturing is the third-largest employment sector in Chattanooga, with 40,500 jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""It's really at this nexus of the different states we want to expand into,"" Jonga said in an interview. ""There's a reason why logistics boomed here ... Everything has to go through Chattanooga at some point.""

Users can create a Laborup profile in a web browser like Google Chrome or Safari. The start-up plans to launch a mobile app in December as it attracts more users in urban areas, Jonga said.

Laborup uses artificial intelligence to build detailed profiles faster than individual human recruiters can. Its primary value is for employers who spend lots of money and time hiring workers, only to lose them a shortly thereafter.

Laborup says it speeds hiring processes by five to 10 times, increases retention by over three times and costs companies more than 50% less than traditional hiring processes.

""Usually, the person we're talking to is a stressed-out operations manager or HR manager,"" Jonga said. ""They're in a hiring crunch. There's a lot of downtime. Machines are not running because they don't have enough people.""

The app is like a LinkedIn focused on blue-collar workers and employers, and it has attracted major Silicon Valley investors.

MILLIONS RAISED

Laborup raised $7.7 million in two fundraising rounds in 2024 and 2025, it announced in August. Its individual investors include Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Jeff Jordan, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and a board member at Airbnb.

The app has some of the same early investors as platforms like LinkedIn did. This provides a major advantage for getting connected to clients, Jonga said.

""Most of these investors are usually making 10 to 20 unique investments a year, so it's largely about the mission,"" Jonga said. ""It helps a ton to share an early investor with a company, because usually they have the ear of the CEO.""

Jonga, who immigrated to Tennessee with his family from South Africa as a teenager, graduated from UT in 2022. He studied AI as a graduate student at Stanford University before taking leave to create Laborup in 2023.

The app's clients include East Tennessee manufacturers from Bush's Beans in Knoxville to HCB Yachts in Vonore. Its broad focus so far is industries that cut or shape metal.

Laborup is designed to attract clients in markets that are growing quickly, like the nuclear industry in Oak Ridge or the distribution industry in Nashville, Jonga said. The startup has met with Siskin Steel in Chattanooga.

Laborup begins the process of working with companies by indexing the physical layout of their plants, including the number of machines and floor plan.

""What you do, and the machines you have and the people you have and those work instructions determine who you're trying to hire,"" Jonga said. ""We want to understand the whole operation of the company.""

Jonga said Laborup wants to expand its work with chemical companies like Wacker, which operates a large polysilicon plant in Bradley County north of Chattanooga.

Wacker, Astec and Miller Industries are among Hamilton County employers that laid off workers earlier this year. Some local business leaders pointed to tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump as a cause of uncertainty in their markets.

State and federal data, however, points to growth in manufacturing and a growing need for workers.

THE OPPORTUNITY

Tennessee's advanced energy sector, which includes nuclear power and electric vehicle manufacturing, generated $56 billion of gross domestic product and supported nearly 421,000 jobs with an average salary of $74,000 in 2024, according to a report from the Tennessee Advanced Energy Business Council.

Manufacturing is projected to be the state's second-largest sector by employment through 2032, behind health care and social assistance, according to state data. Workers in the sector saw wage growth as the average hourly pay rose from $23.68 to $24.54 in 2024.

But many jobs in the sector go unfilled. There were 409,000 job openings in the U.S. manufacturing industry in August, down from 438,000 in July, according to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The bureau has not published employment reports for two months during the longest government shutdown in history.)

The sector could have 3.8 million job openings by 2033, according to a report from the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte.

Recruiting and retaining quality workers was cited by 47% of manufacturers as a top challenge in a quarterly survey published in September by the National Association of Manufacturers.

Laborup hopes to take advantage of a moment when bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. is a bipartisan issue.

""We firmly believe it's the greatest country in the world, and I think you can't not have an industrial base,"" Jonga said. ""The physical world is still the substrate, even for the services of the software world.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/11/17/103848168_073125-MASTER-MACHINE-003_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-11-15 13:01:59.781269

Today, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava alongside the Department of Solid Waste Management (DSWM) County officials and the Miami-Dade Innovation Authority (MDIA) proudly announced the winners of MDIA’s fifth public innovation challenge. This challenge focused on solutions that will divert waste, particularly organic waste, from County landfills, enhance recycling efforts, and strengthen strategies to reduce waste and educate and engage residents.

Miami-Dade County produces over five million tons of waste annually. According to Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) only 37 percent of the County’s waste is actually recycled with a contamination rate of approximately 39 percent. Piloting innovative technologies and easy‑to‑use tools will help the County increase recycling participation, divert more material, increase re-use of organic waste and recyclables, and reduce environmental impact.

The announcement event included demonstrations of the three winning technology solutions. Beginning in 2026, two of the startups will participate in a pilot test conducted at South Dade Landfill and Old South Dade Landfill; the other pilot will be deployed county-wide to educate residents on how to sort their waste. The selected winners include two local South Florida companies: Clean Earth Innovations, which will process organic waste through a rotary pyrolysis to create nutrient-rich biochar; and Fertile Earth Worm Farm, which deploys a composting solution to create high-quality, organic soil blends. The other winner is Scrapp, whose phone-based app educates and engages residents on proper waste disposal practices.

“As we advance our Zero Waste Master Plan, Miami-Dade is taking bold action to reduce landfill waste and build a more resilient Miami-Dade by pressure testing these solutions in real-world settings,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. “We’re running out of space in our landfills, and the time to act is now. Every innovative step we take helps protect our planet, reduce waste, and create a cleaner, more sustainable future for generations to come, which is why we’re positioning Miami-Dade County to lead in Zero Waste innovation while solving real problems for the residents we serve.""

Piloting the innovative technologies selected through the Public Innovation Challenge will inform and complement the County's Zero Waste Master Plan, a comprehensive roadmap that outlines a path forward to divert, reduce, and reuse overall waste in our community.

“Miami-Dade's new waste mandates require at least a 40% reduction in waste sent to landfills and such a substantial portion could be composted or reused,"" said Leigh-Ann Buchanan, President and CEO of MDIA. “Through the pilots of these winning solutions, we're demonstrating that innovation and technology can be at the forefront of optimizing efficiencies in waste diversion.”

MDIA’s Public Innovation Challenge sources, selects, funds, and facilitates pilots by early‑to growth‑stage companies to help solve high‑impact public problems. MDIA, in partnership with DSWM, selected the Public Innovation Challenge winners from a competitive pool of over 80 applicants, including local and global technology companies, after the challenge launched in March 2025. Each selected company will receive funding for $100,000 and the opportunity to test and validate their solutions with DSWM in a pilot setting.

""Our commitment to serve Miami-Dade residents means constantly improving how we manage waste and protect our environment,” said Miami-Dade County DSWM Director Aneisha Daniel, PhD. “By partnering with startups through this challenge, we’re exploring practical, sustainable solutions that serve our communities better and ensure a cleaner, healthier future for Miami-Dade County residents.""

As the County’s population continues to grow, waste diversion remains a critical strategy in mitigating environmental impact. By reducing the amount of waste being disposed of, communities can conserve natural resources, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, prevent soil and water contamination, and reduce the need to extract new resources for manufacturing. The four companies selected as winners of this Public Innovation Challenge will support these efforts and position Miami-Dade County as a leader in pursuing innovative approaches to its solid waste challenges.

This is the first time since the inaugural Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995 that the U.S. will not be officially represented at the annual climate summit.

However, a large number of state and local representatives — as well as environmental nonprofits based in the U.S. — are in attendance.

A coalition of 100 local U.S. leaders — including governors, mayors and other top city and state officials — made the trip to Belem, Brazil, as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among the notable Americans at COP30, bashed President Donald Trump for disregarding the event, which kicked off Monday.

“While Donald Trump skips the world stage, California is showing up — leading, partnering, and proving what American climate leadership looks like,” Newsom said on Tuesday.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, said in a press conference on Friday that the “Trump administration simply does not represent the American public on climate issues.”

Whitehouse, a ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, accused the current administration of representing the fossil fuel industry, “most particularly the big fossil fuel donors who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s political campaign.”

Why the U.S. did not send any delegates to COP30

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to COP30, according to the White House.

“The U.S. is not sending any high level representatives to COP30,” a White House official told ABC News ahead of the start of the conference. “The president is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships.”

Last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told The Associated Press that COP30 is “essentially a hoax.”

“It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told the AP, follow a two-day business conference in Athens.

Wright added that he may attend next year’s climate conference “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

The record-breaking U.S. federal government shutdown, which ended late Wednesday, also prevented federal lawmakers from attending the conference.

Who is at COP30?

Most of the nearly 200 countries that participate in the UNFCCC attend COP.

A total of 193 countries, plus the European Union, registered a delegation for the summit. Even North Korea sent a delegation to the climate summit, according to a Carbon Brief analysis.

The only other countries not in attendance are Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino, with each having displayed “sporadic” attendance at past conferences, according to Carbon Brief.

Other notable U.S. politicians who made the event include Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and former Vice President Al Gore.

Several mayors of American cities are also in attendance, including Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson.

American cities have always been at the forefront of innovation and climate action, said Gallego, chair of Climate Mayors and C40 Cities vice chair, in a statement.

“Mayors across the country are doubling down to fill the current void of leadership at the federal level,” Gallego said.

Other notable attendees from the U.S. at COP30 this year include Taryn Finnessey, managing director of the U.S. Climate Alliance.

Why experts say it’s important that the US participates in COP30

It is integral that the U.S., as one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to be present at every COP, environmental advocates told ABC News.

The U.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways, and therefore engagement by Americans signals to investors that the world’s largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes of the energy transition, Maria Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition, told ABC News.

“The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters,” Mendiluce said.

Being on the ground at COP is “essential” so delegations can engage with “full strength,” Max Frankel, director of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Institute, told ABC News.

In addition, the scope and urgency of the climate crisis demands an international response, Max Holmes, president and CEO of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News.

It is important to let other countries know that many Americans are still working to combat climate change, Lynda Hopkins, supervisor of California’s 5th district, County of Sonoma, told ABC News.

Although the White House isn’t in Belem to represent U.S. interest, Americans at COP30 are still working for solutions that are in the best interest of the country, Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told ABC News.

“While the Trump administration retreats, the people and companies here are seizing the opportunity to innovate, create jobs, and build safer, healthier futures,” Krupp said.

Although Hopkins said she and other American subnational delegates were “warmly received” by other countries, some prominent figures at COP30 indicated that the U.S. was not needed at the conference to accomplish goals.

Christiana Figueres, a diplomat from Costa Rica who played a key role in the inception of the 2015 Paris Agreement, said the U.S. would not be able to “do their direct bullying” due to the Trump administration’s boycott of the summit.

“I actually think it is a good thing,” Figueres said during a press conference on Tuesday.

Figueres then said, “Ciao, bambino,” which translates to “Bye, little boy,” in Italian, in response to Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time.

Patrick Drupp, director of climate policy for the Sierra Club, described the Trump administration’s absence as “shortsighted decision” and a “slap in the face” to Americans who want clean air and water and lower energy costs.

“The reality is that this work will continue with or without America,” Frankel said.

COP30 is scheduled to run through Nov. 21.

He said China's dominance in renewable energy and electric vehicles was bolstering its position in climate diplomacy.
""Little by little, China is acting as a guarantor of the climate regime,"" said one senior diplomat from an emerging economy.
Biniaz said she was not yet convinced that China was playing a leadership role beyond the pavilions.
Li Shuo, a veteran observer of China at U.N. climate talks who heads the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, countered that China's technology position was already a show of political leadership because its companies were making U.N. pledges achievable.","With the United States absent from the U.N. annual international climate summit for the first time in three decades, China is stepping into the limelight as a leader in the fight against global warming.

Its country pavilion dominates the entrance hall of the sprawling COP30 conference grounds in Brazil's Amazon city of Belem, executives from its biggest clean energy companies are presenting their visions for a green future to large audiences in English, and its diplomats are working behind the scenes to ensure constructive talks.

Those were Washington's roles, but they now reside with Beijing.

""Water flows to where there is space, and diplomacy often does the same,"" Francesco La Camera, director general at the International Renewable Energy Agency, told Reuters.

He said China's dominance in renewable energy and electric vehicles was bolstering its position in climate diplomacy.

China’s transformation from a quiet presence at the U.N.’s Conference of the Parties summits to a more central player seeking the world’s attention reflects a shift in the fight against global warming since U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to office.

Long a skeptic of climate change, Trump has again pulled the United States - the world's largest historic emitter - from the landmark international Paris Agreement to limit global warming. This year, for the first time ever, he declined to send an official high-level delegation to represent U.S. interests at the summit.

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters.

But critics warn the U.S. withdrawal from the process cedes valuable ground in the climate negotiations, particularly as China, currently the world's top greenhouse gas emitter, rapidly expands its renewable and EV industries.

""China gets it,"" said California Governor Gavin Newsom during a visit to the conference earlier this week. ""America is toast competitively, if we don't wake up to what the hell they're doing in this space, on supply chains, how they're dominating manufacturing, how they’re flooding the zone.""

Beautiful world

Unlike previous years, when China had a modest pavilion with just a handful of seats available for mostly technical and academic panels, its COP30 pavilion occupies prime space near the entrance next to host country Brazil.

Cups of sustainable Chinese single-origin coffee, panda toys and branded swag lure in passers-by who can watch presentations by Chinese officials and executives from the world's biggest renewable energy companies.

""Let's honor the legacy and fulfill the Paris guided by the vision of shared future,"" Meng Xiangfeng, vice president of China's CATL, the world's largest battery maker, told an audience on Thursday.

""Let's advance climate cooperation and build a clean, beautiful world together.""

The battery giant already supplies one-third of batteries for EV makers including Tesla TSLA.O, Ford F.N and Volkswagen VOWG.DE. It was CATL's first time hosting an event at a COP, seeking to reach an audience of governments and NGOs.

Earlier that afternoon, China's vice minister of ecology Li Gao told a packed audience that China's status as the world's leading producer of renewable energy ""brings benefits to countries, particularly in the Global South"".

China's State Grid, the world's largest electric utility, and solar giants Trina and Longi also made presentations.

Chinese electric auto giant BYD introduced a fleet of plug-in hybrid vehicles compatible with biofuel manufactured at its plant in Bahia, Brazil, for use at COP30.

Both COP President Andre Correa do Lago and COP30 CEO Ana de Toni have praised China's role as a clean energy technology leader.

""China has shown leadership not only by carrying out its own energy revolution, but with China's scale capacity, we can now also buy low-carbon... at competitive prices,"" de Toni told Reuters.

""China is very determined not only to continue to be a very stable leader in the Paris Agreement, strengthening climate governance, but also to take very practical actions to support other countries.""

Behind the scenes

China is playing a more subtle role behind the scenes in the negotiations by filling a void left by the United States, which was known for rallying governments toward agreement, according to current and former diplomats involved in negotiations.

""Little by little, China is acting as a guarantor of the climate regime,"" said one senior diplomat from an emerging economy. ""They invested a lot on the green economy. If there's any kind of involution, they will lose.""

One Brazilian diplomat said China played a key role in helping reach an agreement over the COP30 agenda before negotiations even began, whereas in previous years its diplomats would not get involved unless there was some key issue for them.

Sue Biniaz, who served as U.S. deputy climate envoy under John Kerry and was a key architect of the Paris Agreement, said China had the ability to bring together the wide-ranging interests of the developing world, from major emerging economies like the BRICS to small developing nations. She worked closely with Chinese counterparts on four bilateral climate agreements, including the one that unlocked the Paris deal.

""They tend to be very tough, take on tough positions like the U.S. did, but then be pragmatic towards the end,"" she told Reuters. ""They have to come up with an outcome that nobody thinks is bad enough to block.""

Biniaz said she was not yet convinced that China was playing a leadership role beyond the pavilions.

""If they had wanted to, they would have put in a more ambitious emission reduction target,"" she said, referring to China’s announcement in September that it would cut emissions at least 7% from their peak by 2035.

Li Shuo, a veteran observer of China at U.N. climate talks who heads the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, countered that China's technology position was already a show of political leadership because its companies were making U.N. pledges achievable.

""The most powerful country isn’t the one with the loudest microphone at COP,"" he said, ""but the one actually producing and investing in low-carbon technologies.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251115-cop30-china-nd-26a85b.jpg",N,,2025-11-15 13:59:41.719585

At the recent celebration of the 50th anniversary of Sullom Voe Oil Terminal being built, everyone involved emphasised how it had been an opportunity for employment, indeed careers for local people. Many of those who’ve benefited from those opportunities were in the audience.

EnQuest managing director Steve Bowyer and SIC convener Andrea Manson both highlighted the ever-nearing transition to clean energy as critical to continuing such opportunities.

While rightly focused on the community’s involvement throughout the history of the terminal, there was a recurring refrain of the oil industry welcoming the net zero future.

At the same time last week, the trade body Scottish Renewables, perhaps surprisingly, leapt to the support of oil and gas businesses, calling upon the chancellor to reform the windfall tax to protect investment in the North Sea.

The urgency of our climate breakdown has been highlighted at COP30 in Brazil this week, lending weight to the many voices calling for the government to stop licensing fossil fuel projects and start ending our crippling dependency on burning dinosaur remnants.

However, even the most vociferous Just Stop Oil campaigners admit that we’re at least going to have to wind down the existing infrastructure.

Without going as far as “drill-baby-drill”, renewable energy leaders wrote to support slowing the pace of decline in North Sea oil and gas while speeding up the deployment of renewables.

The common thread within both these items was jobs.

The risks of losing an existing skilled workforce; the challenges trying to find and fill new posts; and the opportunity to use the former to meet the latter. A just transition. But that might not be enough in Shetland. It’s hard to miss that local businesses are struggling to find staff.

There are serious challenges for important local services. It’s almost as if Shetland doesn’t have enough working people. We need more.

The numerous major energy projects reported (in these very pages) worry many but do represent an opportunity for new jobs that other regions already envy.

Quite reasonably the community is questioning the balance of costs and benefits. Of gains and losses. Of desirable economic activity or industrialisation.

We can sell how wonderful Shetland is for visitors but people need good jobs to actually live here.

We could cease all energy development, but when they start shuttering Sullom Voe Terminal then we might have bigger problems than the view. Grangemouth anyone?

We can argue about the precise extent but Shetland needs the energy transition.

We arguably don’t have a choice and need now to recognise the importance of planning ahead to have enough clean energy roles locally to give options for the declining oil and gas sector and to offer more of the types of skilled trades and professional positions that people and families living here can build lives around.

The thing that’s going to keep school-leavers living in, or returning to, Shetland is tangible pathways from entry level to skilled worker to supervisor to professional to advisor.

Once we have clear policy signals for what’s going to be developed around Shetland then that allows our local businesses and supply chain to invest in hiring for the future.

Apprenticeships will be the critical pathway. Plenty of local firms give, or want to give, chances to local youngsters. Plenty of local firms are also using temporary incoming workers. That’s fine too but it could be even better if we can get those workers to stay and bring their families here as well.

Back in the museum for the 50th anniversary event, sitting alongside locals who jumped at the chance to get jobs at Sullom Voe were many who came north for a project but ended up settling.

Another important way to address the skills gap will be by supporting women to join the workforce in different capacities.

The energy sector is still male-dominated and fixing that will take intervention.

Encouraging the uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) subjects, providing funding for professional development training for women, and ensuring inclusive work environments will be required so more women gain the relevant skills for Shetland’s clean energy jobs.

In fairness, bodies such as Highlands and Islands Enterprise are undertaking considerable work to examine local capability and identify gaps where support for apprentices or women could help.

There are now national plans for jobs in renewables and the energy transition.

When co-ordinated, these together should help that local planning I mentioned.

Local businesses are vital to the challenge. Members of the Shetland Net Zero Energy Forum are particularly engaged but are not alone in giving attention to every stage of learning, including the earliest stages of skills support. From site visits to schools engagement to tertiary input for our sector.

The Careers Fair remains an annual highpoint for many.

As if last week didn’t have enough going on, my company supported the delivery of the second year of the reintroduced Shetland Science Fair for all of Shetland’s secondary one and two pupils plus many of the secondary threes.

Some 650 local pupils getting encouragement to develop the skills that could eventually lead to qualifications or trades that could then meet the jobs that Shetland desperately needs to remain sustainable.

If we get this right then 50 years from now there’ll be events in the museum discussing how Shetland transitioned from oil and gas to renewables and clean energies and how the community continued to take the opportunities created.

For years, President Trump has lamented the United States’ embrace of the renewable energy sector, with wind having a particular place in his apparent dislike for the industry. Now, industry leaders have pointed out that his administration’s cutbacks on wind power permits and cancellations of projects have effectively paralyzed the offshore wind industry in the United States. With the rest of the world embracing the renewable energy sector, the US stance is a far cry from the global adoption that the industry has seen.

Industry analysts point out that U.S. shipbuilders and port operators have been hit the hardest by Trump’s wind power policies

U.S. shipbuilders and port operators have seen serious damage to their profits and overall competitiveness due to the wave of project cancellations and stop-work orders that have been flowing out of the Trump administration since he took office for the second time.

The previous administration implemented policies to boost wind power in the United States, which has subsequently been essentially reversed by Trump. Stop-work orders, permit delays, and project cancellations have been the name of the game for Trump, as he aims to “drill, baby drill.” We suspect that what he meant by that is to bring back the reliance on coal and oil in the US and do away with the policies aimed at increasing federal assistance for the renewable energy sector.

Trump has publicly expressed his dislike for the wind sector on many occasions. The question is why

Trump calls offshore wind turbines “unsightly” and has, on several occasions, stated that the huge wind turbines are “making the whales a little bit batty”, whatever that means. Some have said that his disdain stems from a wind project in Scotland that spoils his view from his golf course as the main driver for his dislike for the sector, although there is no way of definitively proving that.

The impact of Trump’s policies has substantially affected the wind power sector

The US’s embrace of the renewable energy sector has hit a snag, with Trump’s policies affecting millions of dollars of profits for the shipbuilding sector, which relies heavily on contracts to transport workers and turbines to offshore projects.

The reported impacts include the more than $679 million worth of canceled Department of Transportation financing for ports that feed the offshore wind sector in the United States. This includes a $34 million grant for a facility in Salem, Massachusetts, which would have generated millions in tax revenue and created thousands of jobs for locals.

The Trump administration is not backing down, and claims the shipbuilding industry can be saved by them, of course

Mr Trump’s administration has stated that it can easily revive the US shipbuilding industry without the support of the offshore wind sector. One questions the reasoning and logic, as the wind sector has been proven to save billions in the long run, evidenced by the recent reports that the UK has saved billions over the past decade due to its embrace of the offshore wind sector.

The North Carolina Ports Authority asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to evaluate a proposal to deepen the Cape Fear River channel. The goal: to improve efficiency by better accommodating the larger Post-Panamax cargo ships that now dominate global trade.

According to USACE’s “Wilmington Harbor 403: Draft Environmental Impact Statement,” the project is intended to “contribute to national economic development by addressing transportation inefficiencies for the forecasted vessel fleet, consistent with protecting the Nation’s environment.” In 2020, Congress conditionally approved $834 million for the project, pending environmental review. A cost-sharing agreement between the USACE Wilmington District and the NC Ports Authority followed in 2022, and the “Wilmington Harbor 403 Draft Environmental Impact Statement” was released in September 2025.

Public comment was solicited multiple times on the proposal, with USACE scientists presenting a summary of their findings to the public on October 8, 2025. Although the draft includes three options: No Action (NAA), AA1 (dredging to 47 feet), and AA2 (dredging to 45 feet), only NAA and AA1 remain under consideration after the draft. USACE accepted written public comments until November 3, 2025.

Two Options Now Under Consideration

USACE is charged with choosing the option that Brett Walters, Chief of the Planning and Environmental Branch, explained, “best balances the costs, benefits, and adverse impacts.”

No Action Alternative (NAA) — maintain the current 42-foot channel with regular maintenance dredging.

Alternative Action 1 (AA1) — deepen the channel by 5 feet, plus 2 feet for error, to 47 feet and deepening to 49 feet from Battery Island into the ocean to reach deeper water. Widening the river channel in many areas and adding a channel prism (an angle to the sides) to reduce shoaling.

The project would relocate dredged material to several local beaches, marshes, islands, and eroding river shorelines. The plan also includes a mitigation plan to offset environmental impacts.

Since a thousand acres of freshwater wetlands are predicted to become brackish or salt marshes, the mitigation plan includes purchasing and protecting from development 500 acres of freshwater marsh around the Black River, a tributary that joins the Cape Fear River about 10 miles north of downtown Wilmington.

The mitigation plan also includes attempting to remove persistent invasive species from a different salt marsh to improve the habitat, and rerouting fish, like striped bass and endangered sturgeon, around and over dams they can't traverse when spawning. If approved, construction of AA1 would begin in 2030 and take six years, optimistically.

Potential Benefits of AA1

USACE says AA1 will give Post-Panamax ships more room to navigate and cause less erosion to riverbanks because there will be more ship clearance. According to USACE Oceanographer Dr. Grace Maze, deeper water would reduce stress on the riverbed by giving ships more clearance between their hulls and the channel bottom.

Shipping companies would also save money. Currently, larger cargo ships must “light load” to navigate the Cape Fear, meaning they carry less cargo and make more trips. They must also time their arrivals and departures with high tide, which creates inefficiency and increased cost. If ships could enter fully loaded, the Corp states that fewer trips will be needed. According to the Draft Report, the average annual net benefit would be $15,874,000, producing a cost-to-benefit ratio of 1.3.

“This is not fantastic,” said geologist Roger Shew, a retired UNCW professor, “but it meets the criteria” for the government to remain interested in the project.

USACE states the plan is unlikely to harm regional drinking water. Clarissa Murray, P.E., lead civil engineer in hydraulics, notes that water wells in Carolina Beach, Kure, and Bald Head Island should not experience saltwater intrusion from the project. In addition, David Connelly, also with USACE, adds that in Wilmington, impacts to salinity at the supply wells are small and unlikely to be noted.

Because of the loss of freshwater wetlands and impacts to aquatic habitat, mandated mitigation in the project includes improved fish passage around Lock and Dam 1, LD1 (near Reigelwood), and a rock arch rapid at Lock and Dam 2, LD2 (near Elizabethtown), potentially helping some fish reach their spawning grounds. In addition, purchasing about 500 acres of freshwater marsh near the Black River will protect it from development.

Roughly half of the dredged materials are earmarked for beneficial use, including rebuilding eroded beaches, marsh areas, and shorelines, areas on the Cape Fear River, and the Wilmington Offshore Fisheries Structure.

“The rocks will provide important reef habitats in the offshore environment,” explained Shew.

Environmental Concerns

Critics of the AA1 plan warn that the ecological costs could outweigh the economic benefits. Endangered species such as green sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon could be harmed by both the deepening process and its long-term effects. Increased water particles and rock blasting vibrations may greatly impact sturgeon. Blasting impacts might be minimized with proper procedures, noted Shew.

Below: Adapted from the draft report. This table shows the animals in the area, whether or not they might be affected by the project, and how likely the effect might be.

Other species, like oysters, southern flounder, spot, and striped bass, will be negatively affected by the project. Wildlife, including turtles, can be trapped and killed in the machinery, and moving sediment to beaches could interfere with turtles during nesting and hatching. Shew pointed out that removing sediment will likely impact creatures living on and in the riverbed, like crabs.

The NC Audubon Society expressed concern in an online statement about “heavier ships and larger wakes into the river, which erode nesting islands, increasing overwash of nests, and will destroy over 1,000 acres of wetlands that support bottomland forest birds, fisheries, [and] water quality.”

Other scientists warn of subtle but lasting physical changes to the river system. USACE’s Dr. Maze noted that tidal range and storm surge would increase only slightly—about 0.11 feet at high tide. Even minor changes can compound with sea-level rise.

Shew explained that Wilmington is “having one of the larger rises in sea level on the East Coast since 2000 and is a compound flood area... This will have even more impact in the future…Even with no sea level rise, a 500-year storm event, a surge in a deepened river would increase peak water levels by 3.1% at Wilmington and expand the total inundation area by 0.5% compared to taking no action.”

Erosion and bed stress would also continue.

“Regardless of the action, increased vessel traffic over time would continue to elevate sediment disturbance and shoreline vulnerability through Wilmington Harbor,” said Maze.

Cargo volumes will continue to increase and, “the vessel fleet serving the US East Coast is expected to continue to shift to larger vessels in the future,” said David Connelly, Chief of Public Affairs for USACE.

Maintenance dredging would not end either—in fact, it could accelerate. Maze explained that deepening has historically increased the rate by 6 to 34% in some places without sea level change. The channel becomes shallow again from sediment accumulation, requiring more frequent dredging and associated costs. Maze adds that as sea levels rise, the rate will increase further.

Climate change may compound these risks.

“We have seen the impact of 500 and even 1000-year flood events caused by heavier rainfall,” Shew wrote in a summary he shared with the public. “When coupled with the higher tides, storm surge, and sea level rise, our area businesses and property are even more at risk.”

Saltwater intrusion is another growing concern. Deepening the channel allows denser saltwater to move farther upstream, converting freshwater wetlands to brackish and killing centuries-old trees.

“Saltier water damages freshwater plants and also causes the breakdown of freshwater organics/mud in the soils,” Shew explained. “This breakdown will lead to even more erosion and subsidence in the adjacent land areas dominated by the freshwater tidal wetlands.”

A recent UNC Wilmington study found that some trees near the danger zone are over 400 years old, with one dated to at least 800 years. This study also shows a tie between saltwater intrusion and the increase in the size of the ghost forest. Shew shared Google Earth photos taken roughly twenty years apart in the same season, and the evidence of the expansion of the ghost forest is clear. Although the mitigation plan includes protecting some existing freshwater wetlands, it does not restore those that will be lost.

Below: Images shared by Shew, showing the conversion of the Town Creek area from forest to marsh. The change is attributed to soil and salinity changes, resulting from storms and a 2005 dredging project that deepened the Cape Fear from 38 to 42 feet.

The plan includes fish-passage improvements, but the LD2 rock ramp may not be effective, especially for the cost of $32 million.

“A rock ramp was built at LD1 [in 2012 and modified in 2021] as mitigation for previous harbor modifications, but successful passage of Atlantic Sturgeon via the rock ramp has not yet been documented,” according to the draft report. Shew suggested that instead of building another rock ramp at LD2, the funds could be used to remove or partially remove the dam since it isn’t used for storage, allowing fish to use this part of the river naturally. “This would promote upstream migration and provide funds for rock arch rapid construction at LD3, which would possibly allow full passage up the Cape Fear,” Shew explained.

Another issue not yet addressed in the draft report is PFAS contaminated river sediments. Shew pointed out that PFAS information is not addressed since it’s not currently regulated by the EPA. However, it will be regulated in 2031—only one year into this project. Several studies have shown PFAS is present in Cape Fear River sediments. PFAS are dangerous chemicals that can lead to myriad health problems, e.g., cancer, birth defects, thyroid disease, lowered response to vaccination. According to a 2024 study, PFAS can be absorbed through the skin.

“Knowing the level of contaminants in the sediment before dredging is important to determine possible human/wildlife impacts,” said Shew.

No Action Alternative

Choosing NAA would avoid new environmental disturbances, but it wouldn’t eliminate maintenance dredging, which would continue to place materials on Brunswick County beaches and Eagles Island. Larger ships would still need to light-load and rely on high tides, increasing inefficiency and cost. Dr. Maze noted that NAA could actually increase erosion and bed stress by 20% compared to the deepening proposal given the higher number of vessels required.

Conclusions

Critics note that if the AA1 plan is followed, it will bring environmental harm without delivering significant economic benefits. It will increase the loss of trees, salt marsh vegetation, and wildlife, threaten endangered turtles and sturgeon, and increase flooding.

Since 2018, 15 agreements have been signed between national, regional and local governments in areas hit by mine and power plant shutdowns. The government also reached tripartite accords with unions and coal companies, guaranteeing solutions for affected workers.

“For the first time, workers and their communities had a seat at the table. It demonstrated that a just transition is possible and that social dialogue with trade unions must be the first step” Riera said. “That gave people dignity in a moment of loss.”

These frameworks funded retraining, supported job-creating projects and ensured public participation. They became an international reference for how social dialogue can guide decarbonisation.

A just transition for renewables: Why COP30 must put people before power

Lessons learned: from energy to social transition

But the experience has also exposed key limits. Job creation alone has not been enough to sustain rural life.

“Again and again we heard: in addition to employment, what decides if families stay is whether there is transport, housing, health care, education,” Riera said. “That is what keeps a territory alive. We have to move from an energy transition to a social transition.”

Judit Carreras Garcia, director of the Instituto para la Transición Justa (ITJ), reflected on the government’s efforts to respond to these challenges:

“Over the years, we have sought to make the just transition a reality through concrete policies and actions — walking the talk through a wide range of measures that include employability schemes, training, funding lines for job-creating business initiatives, just transition energy tender grids, municipal support programmes and environmental restoration,” she explained.

“All of them aim at minimising the impacts of decarbonisation and optimising outcomes based on participation and social dialogue. This effort has come with its own challenges — from managing timing gaps to addressing very different territorial starting points — but our commitment remains firm.”

Both unions and government acknowledge that anticipation is crucial: closures must be aligned with new opportunities, and support must adapt to vastly different territorial realities – from regions facing depopulation to those with stronger infrastructure.

The next phase for just transition

UGT is now working with its federations to shape Spain’s next Just Transition Strategy (2026–2030). Visits to pact areas, including Aragón, where a coal plant closed in 2020, reveal a rising sense of frustration.

“People are tired of waiting,” Riera said. “We have projects on paper, but they don’t see them materialising. Without effective coherent planning, workers retrain and then have to move to Madrid or Barcelona. That is not territorial justice.”

The unions’ demand: keep the territorial approach, but expand it across ministries and sectors, ensuring that services and infrastructure grow alongside jobs.

For Indian women workers, a just transition means surviving climate impacts with dignity

Behind the technical debates lies a deeper fear: the hollowing out of rural Spain, where thousands of villages have already lost their young people and their future. A mishandled transition could accelerate that trend.

“This is not only about jobs,” Riera said. “It is about whether towns survive at all. When a power station shuts, it’s not just the jobs inside the gates that disappear. The bus stops running, the school risks closing, the clinic can’t keep going, housing starts to deteriorate. Families leave, and a town empties. And once they leave, they rarely come back.”

Sharing lessons internationally

In September, Riera met unions from around the world to share Spain’s experience. His message was simple: we must fight for social dialogue and territorial agreements, but these are the beginning — not the end — of a just transition.

“If decisions are only made in the capital, they miss what life is like in a village. What Madrid sees as energy policy, a small town sees as survival: will there still be a bus, a clinic, a school? That is why workers and communities must always be in the room.”

For Riera, the work that goes into the just transition is also a chance to imagine something new.

“We can use this moment not just to protect people from loss, but to renew rural life — to make villages places where families want to stay, where children can imagine their future. This is about dignity, but also about love: love of place, love of community, love of life itself.”

“Water is worth more than lithium,” Indigenous Argentine community tells COP30

A call for Belém – and beyond

Now in Belém for COP30, Riera is bringing a clear message to world leaders: Spain’s experience shows that the just transition must be built from the ground up. The Belém Action Mechanism that has been proposed, he argues, should require cross-sector transition plans – not just energy policies; guarantee participation from workers and communities; and secure public finance capable of delivering not only jobs but the services that sustain life around them.

“The Global South faces the same challenge: how to transition without abandoning people. Without public finance, that is impossible,” he said. “If we treat the just transition as a bargaining chip, we betray them. But if we take it seriously, we can create hope — from Spain to Brazil, from Santander to Belém.”

“This is not only about closing coal or opening renewables,” he added. “It is about whether people can imagine a future for their children. That is what the just transition means.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/Pic-Andorra-2.png,N,,2025-11-15 11:04:25.026161

Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents.
City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,” said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you’re trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn’t make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

“And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people’s behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. “Most people don’t even realize they’re there.”

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they’re protesting or backing. If you like what they’re doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn’t much you can do about it. “I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,” he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

While energy may account for just 7% of America’s GDP, former FERC Chair Mark Christie claims, “it’s the foundational seven percent, everything else in our economy and lifestyle flows from it.”

Between grid overload and extreme weather, sudden power outages cost the U.S. economy an estimated $150 billion per year. The 2021 Texas freeze alone inflicted $130 billion in losses from property damage, lost business, and cascading supply chain disruptions.

We face a simple reality: Our 20th-century grid wasn’t built to support a 21st-century economy. We need leaders who will step up and demand that we upgrade U.S. grid infrastructure—because without a modern, robust grid, our economy, national security, and global standing are at serious risk.

DEMAND IS SURGING AND THE GRID’S NOT READY

According to the latest forecasts, electricity demand is expected to rise sharply over the next few decades, increasing by over three-quarters (78%) by 2050. Electrification and AI have already begun to blindside grid planners. Major utilities report load forecasts five times higher than in 2023, driven by the opening of hyperscale data centers across states like Virginia and Texas.

We can’t afford complacency while demand grows, extreme conditions escalate, and our rivals invest in modernization. While our legacy infrastructure works today, we’re vulnerable to foreign supply chains, and our system is strained by transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays, and a shortage of skilled workers. We’re struggling to deliver power The gap between what our industries require and what the grid can deliver is growing.

We need to change direction, collectively. But change doesn’t happen without a catalyst. Business leaders often think their technology will create its own demand. But there needs to be a catalyst for change. I would argue that these converging pressures are creating a catalyst like we’ve never seen before. True leadership requires seeing around corners and investing in solutions today.

HOW WE GET THERE

The energy revolution we need goes beyond adding more wind turbines and solar batteries. It demands a complete reorg of grid architecture, technology, and management. We need to move from analog to digital thinking. A digital, AI-enabled grid can slash technical losses, enable real-time balancing of supply and demand, and support clean power at scale. New and refreshed technologies, such as grid-enhancing technology (GETs), fusion, and advanced nuclear, need to be part of the solution.

But modernization is complex. Without a collaborative, stable foundation built through public-private partnerships, investments in new technology, grid permitting reform, and strengthening our U.S. workforce, manufacturing, and supply chains, we will never get there.

LEAD BEFORE THE NEED

Across the U.S., nearly 75% of the country’s 35 leading utility companies have reported data centers are demanding more electricity, a demand that will continue to climb. Industry leaders need to make big moves and take bold bets. Investments in grid resilience show a high ROI. A $1 investment in preparedness can yield up to $6 in savings by reducing lost economic activity and recovery costs.

Visionary leaders are already partnering across sectors to reduce constraints to modernization and strengthen our talent pipeline. Microsoft and Google are taking on risk and working with utilities and start-ups to pave the way for innovative energy projects, with companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Antora, and Helion, building domestic solutions, supply chains, and workforce capacity well before full-scale commercial fusion, thermal storage, or grid-scale batteries are the norm.

BUILD RESILIENCE: POLICY, PEOPLE, AND PARTNERSHIPS

Policy is moving in the right direction. A recent White House Executive Order directs the use of all available power generation and decisive steps to prevent grid failures. The CIRCUIT Act and One Big Beautiful Bill Act—along with initiatives like the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act, Advancing GETS Act, and Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act—also support U.S. manufacturing and supply chain expansion. Meanwhile, the DOE’s Speed to Power and workforce innovation programs respond to grid operators’ calls for faster permitting and a new generation of technical talent.

But policy alone won’t solve this problem. We need utility leaders, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), investors, and technology innovators to shoulder the risk, share best practices, and push for scalable market solutions.

Leaders should take the following steps to prepare:

Build U.S.-based supply chains. Source advanced energy components like high-performance capacitors, solid-state transformers, and power electronics through American suppliers to protect against global disruptions, reduce long-term costs, and build a strategic edge.

Invest in workforce development. Train future scientists, engineers, and skilled tradespeople through training programs, partnerships, and upskilling. Growing talent now ensures readiness as grid needs evolve.

Partner early, act urgently. Rather than waiting for new mandates or market saturation, engage utilities, policymakers, technology innovators, investors now to test, scale, and set standards ahead of rising demand, position your organization as a decisive leader.

A TEST OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP

America cannot afford to sit on its heels. Those who invest in the workforce, scale robust supply chains, and co-create with customers will shape our energy future, paving the way for a modern digital grid, commercial fusion, and beyond.

Business and government leaders must act today to strengthen America’s national security and global competitiveness. If we settle for anything less, we risk America’s future as an economic powerhouse and innovation leader. The world’s strongest economy demands the world’s best grid.

He also lauded the promoter of the bill, Senator Kalu, particularly for the potential help the law would be for investors in the EV sector.
Chief Chukwuma said the proposed bill is part of President Bola Tinubu’s green mobility strategy which seeks to promote the use of Compressed Natural Gas and electric vehicles.","The Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill, 2025, has been lauded by some automotive sector chieftains since it came up for second reading on Wednesday, November 5th, 2025.

The proposed legislation, introduced by Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, the Senator representing Abia North, seeks to establish a national framework for the transition to electric vehicles, encourage local manufacturing, and strengthen Nigeria’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

When the proposed legislation had its second reading, lawmakers overwhelmingly supported it, describing it as a necessary step to diversify the economy and align with global clean energy trends.

Senator Kalu had informed the senate that the legislation aims to transform Nigeria’s automotive and energy sectors, foster innovation, and create jobs throughout the manufacturing value chain.

Key highlights of the bill include: tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, and subsidies for electric vehicle users and investors; and making it mandatory for all fuel stations to install charging points

The bill further requires foreign automakers seeking to sell electric vehicles in Nigeria to partner with licensed local assemblers and establish domestic assembly plants within three years.

It also aims to compel companies to source at least 30 percent of their components locally by 2030, while violations could attract fines of up to N250 million per breach, even as unlicensed importers risk penalties of N500 million and confiscation of goods.

The legislation, which is expected to position Nigeria as a potential hub for electric vehicles production in Africa, would incentivise investors who establish charging infrastructure by availing them with government grants and tax credits.

These automotive industry chieftains believe the proposed law is capable of improving the domestic automotive industry, particularly if it is assiduously implemented.

Commenting on the fine points of the proposed law, the Director General of the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), Joseph Osanipin said, “We at the NADDC have said it time and time again, that the future of mobility is in electric vehicles, and it is commendable when your legislators see it the way it is.

“And they have also shown that they are aware that we in Nigeria don’t have to sit back and allow the whole world to move far away and leave us behind, only for us to complain later.

“It will not be good to do nothing now and start complaining later. It is always good that whenever we want to take action, we don’t take action based on policy alone, but also back whatever we are doing with law.

“The (Electric Vehicle Transition) bill in the Senate shows that our society is responsible. It shows that our government is responsible. It shows that all of us are responsible, and it is also good to note that the sponsor of this bill, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, is a member of the Senate committee on Industry that has oversight on NADDC, and he understands the issues involved.“The Senate Committee on Industry is one of the committees where you have many legislators who have held the executive position in their various states. So, Senator Orji Kalu understands what it takes to grow this industry.”

Osanipin said though he had not seen the details of the bill, it was clear to him from what he had read so far that it is all about the development of the auto industry, and about “putting in place the necessary infrastructures, and the necessary support that are going to drive this industry.”

He said many countries have set target dates to end the production and sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles in their efforts to fully transition to electric vehicles and reduce carbon emissions.

“In some countries like China, for example, they have already set a target to stop the manufacture and use of petrol and diesel vehicles, and before that deadline, their people are free to register their vehicles just the way you do your licence every year here.

“But, after that time which I think is in the next eight years or so, you cannot get a licence for your vehicle again if the vehicle is not EV.”

“With various developed economies, including European countries, setting targets of between 2030 and 2040 to completely phase out the manufacture and use of fossil-fuel vehicles.

“We are pushing to get to a point that by 2035, the adoption rate of electric vehicles (in Nigeria) will be much higher,” Osanipin said.

He said, “We also have to develop and prepare, because if we are not looking at taking action today, those vehicles they can no longer register in China and other countries, what do you think will happen to them? Your guess is as good as mine.”

NADDC, he said, would be willing to give any kind of support needed to ensure the bill is passed into law and vigorously implemented. “We are ready to honour their invitation, if they call us to give support. If they need any questions, if they need any information, we are always available. We are happy that our legislature is taking this to the next level.

“It is always good when you have people that are ready to give you legislative backing. We are ready to work with the National Assembly. If they call us for a presentation, we’ll be there. We are ready to work with them.”

The National Coordinator, Automotive Local Content Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (ALCMAN), Chief Anselm Ilekuba, described the proposed law as a welcome development, considering their efforts to manufacture auto parts for vehicle production in the country and to drive the domestic auto industry towards developing the electric vehicle technology.

Also, his company, Cedric Masters Group assembles JIM-ISUZU, a brand of electric vehicles in Lagos.

He also lauded the promoter of the bill, Senator Kalu, particularly for the potential help the law would be for investors in the EV sector.

He presented his EV lineup, stating that “Apart from the rugged 2.4 litre JIM ISUZU Re-Max 4×4 pick-up which has already started making a mark in the market as a reliable work horse, Cedric Masters is also ushering into the Nigerian market the Leapmotor brand known for its affordable and tech-focused new energy vehicles (NEVs).”

He said the company is also introducing into the local market the Voyah brand of luxury electric vehicles. “Our subsidiary, Cedric Clean Energy Solution, which has an electric charge station assembly plant in Lekki, Lagos State, sees this as a wonderful development and calls for greater stakeholder involvement, especially with NADDC and ALCMAN.

“I commend Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for this laudable bill which shows vision and will serve as a cursor to the long-awaited Nigerian Automotive Industry Development Programme.”

The Chairman, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company Ltd (IVM), Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, CON, said the eventual outcome of the bill would tie in with some of the aims of the Nigerian Auto Policy (Nigerian Automotive Industry Development Programme, NAIDP).

Chief Chukwuma, who is building a completely new multibillion naira auto plant in Nnewi, which was conceived to manufacture only EVs and other vehicles that run on Compressed Natural Gas, suggested that the bill should be made to also accommodate the deepening of CNG utilisation.

He said Nigeria has abundant gas, adding that users of CNG-powered vehicles enjoy tremendous advantages, including cheaper cost per kilometre, and considerably low maintenance expenses.

Chief Chukwuma said the proposed bill is part of President Bola Tinubu’s green mobility strategy which seeks to promote the use of Compressed Natural Gas and electric vehicles.",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/pick-up-4-online.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 13:01:09.907049

That's a lot of income if you are trying to live off dividends in retirement.

Just don't get so enamored of the yield that you overlook the full story. Here's why Energy Transfer may not be the stock to set you up for a lifetime of reliable income -- but one of its industry peers could be.

What does Energy Transfer do?

Energy Transfer operates in a sector known for its high volatility. Oil and natural gas prices can fluctuate dramatically and rapidly in response to factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical conflicts, and the economy.

Except that the energy sector isn't one monolithic business. It is actually broken down into three segments.

Energy producers operate in what is known as the upstream segment. Companies that use the upstream output to produce chemicals and refined products, such as gasoline, operate in the downstream segment. Both of these are commodity-driven businesses, with the downstream facing commodity volatility on both the input and output sides of the business.

Energy Transfer operates in what is known as the midstream; this segment connects the upstream to the downstream and the rest of the world. Energy Transfer collects fees for the use of the energy infrastructure it owns, such as pipelines.

Demand for energy is more important than the price of the commodities flowing through its system. Given the importance of oil and natural gas to the world's economy, volumes tend to remain fairly robust even during economic downturns, such as recessions.

From this perspective, Energy Transfer's business is attractive. It gets even more attractive when you see that the MLP produced cash flow that covered its distribution by 1.8 times through the first nine months of 2025. That's strong support for the distribution and gives investors a good reason to believe that Energy Transfer could set them up with a lifetime of reliable income.

Energy Transfer isn't the only midstream giant

Energy Transfer's business isn't unique; there are other midstream businesses that are just as well-positioned. For example, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) has a nearly 7% distribution yield and an investment-grade balance sheet, and its distribution is also well covered. Despite the similarities, though, don't just assume the higher yield is the better choice.

The distributions paid by Energy Transfer and Enterprise Products Partners are approved by each one's board of directors, just like at any other company. Enterprise has increased its distribution annually for 27 consecutive years. Energy Transfer's distribution has increased for four years, if you include 2025, which isn't over yet. Its distribution was cut in half in 2020 so the MLP could focus on strengthening its finances.

When the coronavirus pandemic was raging in 2020, there was a huge amount of uncertainty, including in the energy sector. So it isn't unreasonable that Energy Transfer cut its distribution. But that cut came right when most investors would probably have been hoping for continuity.

Enterprise, by contrast, stuck by its distribution through that difficult period and many that came before it, too. If you are a conservative dividend investor, sacrificing a little yield here might be a good strategy.

Energy Transfer has let investors down before

And Energy Transfer's distribution cut in 2020 wasn't the only time it made a troubling call. In 2016, the company inked a deal to acquire the Williams Companies but then backed out of it because its industry was in a rough state.

The effort to scuttle the deal included issuing convertible securities, a significant portion of which went to the CEO at the time. Those convertible securities would likely have protected the holders from the impact of a dividend cut, which Energy Transfer warned was a possibility if the Williams deal went through.

That deal was called off, so no material harm was done, and the dividend was not cut. However, the 2020 distribution cut, combined with the 2016 situation with Williams, should likely leave investors with trust issues.

There are no similar trust issues with Enterprise Products Partners. That's why Enterprise is probably a better option for conservative investors seeking to set themselves up with a lifetime of reliable income.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2025-11-15 13:02:16.000263

That's why experts say to work in groups,CALEIGH WELLS — Associated Press,,,,,https://www.wral.com/news/ap/5c86f-cop30-makes-individual-climate-actions-seem-small-thats-why-experts-say-to-work-in-groups/,"Hundreds of global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil.
Head to the polls Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.
“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents.
City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions.","Hundreds of global leaders are gathering to discuss how to limit climate change at COP30 in Brazil. Meanwhile, the rest of us may feel that we have very little influence over how decision-makers shape policy with wide-ranging effects on the planet.

But “very little” is not “nothing.” Joining others in community-based actions can have a far larger impact than one person can have alone.

“Rather than acting as an individual by yourself trying to make yourself as small as possible, (you can) join with others to try to make your impact as big as possible,"" said Leah Stokes, environmental politics and public policy professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.

Community action takes different forms. The most effective option depends on what kind of change you're trying to accomplish. Here are three common approaches in the United States.

Head to the polls

Voting is often the most effective climate action in a democratic country because large-scale policies are typically set by elected officials, according to some climate experts.

“You have a direct access to decide who makes the decisions,” said environment professor Anthony Leiserowitz, who directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “They’re the ones that we are basically choosing as our leaders to make these system-level choices for us that are going to profoundly affect our lives.”

For example, the U.S. has twice withdrawn from the Paris Agreement climate treaty after voters elected President Donald Trump, who deprioritizes climate action.

Leiserowitz said some might think that a single vote doesn't make a meaningful difference in a country as large as the U.S., where more than 150 million people participated in last year’s election.

""And yet we have seen again and again, including the most recent election, that actually these are incredibly close, and that votes do matter,” he said.

Voters also elect members of Congress who make budget decisions and write laws. There are also often climate-related ballot measures. Governors and state lawmakers shape policies in their area. Elected leaders of local governments decide on public transit routes, trash collection, bike lanes and public electric vehicle chargers that can change people's behavior and reduce planet-warming emissions.

“As a U.S. citizen who feels as though policy decisions are being made that are far beyond their control, I think there are still meaningful ways to engage,” said Finn Hossfeld, climate policy analyst at New Climate Institute. “Those are changes that are happening at the state level that are shielded from changes that are happening at the federal level.”

Talk to elected officials

There are two ways to do this: Call local, state and federal representatives, or show up at public meetings.

Ideally, elected officials cast votes and propose laws that represent the will of their constituents. They generally wish to remain popular so they can get reelected. In both cases, knowing and acting on your opinion is important to them.

The U.S. House and Senate have directories of representatives and their contact information. State and local representatives also typically list contact information on their websites.

City councils, county boards and school boards have public meetings where residents can share their opinions before elected officials make decisions. Leiserowitz said sometimes these meetings are not well-attended, so an individual can have an outsized impact.

“Nobody ever focuses on public utility commissions. Most of them by law have to have public hearings where they are deciding what energy system you are going to be using when you flip on that light switch. Is it being driven by fossil fuels? Is it been driven by clean energy?” he said. ""Most people don’t even realize they’re there.""

When she’s not teaching or writing, Stokes collaborates with students and activists to advocate for phasing out oil and gas in her community. She said collective action can be even more effective when people seek smaller changes closer to home.

“Everyday people can show up to local hearings. They can show up to a permit process for a solar project,” she said. “All the action happens really at the scale of a building, at the scale of the car, at a scale of an oil well.”

Volunteer for a group that shares your values

Nonprofits, think tanks, legal action groups and advocacy groups will sometimes select legislation to challenge or support. They often rely on volunteers with specific expertise to make a dent in the issues they're protesting or backing. If you like what they're doing, you can increase their impact by joining.

“Political systems, economic systems, social systems tend not to just change because it’s the smart thing to do. They change because there’s a constituency demanding it. And that’s particularly true in democracies,” Leiserowitz said.

For example, maybe your issue is a more efficient and comprehensive U.S. rail network. Alone, there isn't much you can do about it. ""I would love to be able to take a high-speed, highly energy-efficient bullet train from New York to California, but I can’t do that because I live in a society that hasn’t given me that option,"" he said.

But there are multiple groups working to make better trains a reality.

Leiserowitz said another positive effect of public action is that it signals to others that it’s worth the effort, and encourages them to try it themselves.

“On a research standpoint, when we ask Americans, ‘What gives you hope?’ There’s one answer that comes back that’s bigger than any other,” he said. “And that is seeing other people acting.”

Forterra Developers plans to build duplexes and townhomes on a 50-acre lot right off State Highway 29 West in Georgetown.

In most cases, a developer would go through several meetings with city council and the public to approve such a development. In this case, the developer does not have to go through that many hurdles because they deannexed the land from Georgetown’s extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ).

The ability to do that became possible through a law passed during the 2023 Texas legislative session. Senate Bill 2038, authored by Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, allows residents and property owners in an ETJ to apply for removal from the ETJ.

Since that law passed, the City of Georgetown said they have had:

105 disannexation requests

91 accepted disannexation requests that met all needed requirements

3,965 acres total disannexed

“What it creates is what we call the Swiss cheese effect, where you’ll have a parcel that is completely surrounded by the City of Georgetown—that is not in the City of Georgetown,” said Josh Schroeder, the Mayor of Georgetown.

To see what parts of Georgetown’s ETJ have been deannexed, click here.

KXAN has also reached out to Bettencourt’s office for his thoughts on the consequences of the law since it passed. We will update this story if a response is given.

“You’ll have a donut hole where we’re providing police service all around an area, but not within that area. Or we’re providing trash service all around an area, but not within that area,” Schroeder said. “Or we’re providing wastewater service all around an area, but not within that area—and that little donut hole of an area may have their own wastewater plant.”

Community members who live close to where the wastewater treatment plant would be built voice concerns over its possible effects to the environment.

“We are sitting right in the middle of the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone—so a really sensitive area,” said Rebecca Burnett, who lives nearby.

“We really fear what will happen with the water quality and the pollution because bad things happen, mistakes happen,” said Danette Ray, who also lives nearby.

Satish Babu Chakka is the CEO of Forterra Developers, and he says the reason why they deannexed is because it was too expensive to build infrastructure to connect Georgetown’s wastewater system due to the location of the development.

“You would have to spend about $40 million or $50 million to bring that infrastructure—and we are the small developers, building only 350 units,” Chakka said. “That’s humongous cost.”

Chakka said that they are following the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s (TCEQ) guidelines to build the water treatment plant.

“We are following those guidelines at the end of the day, and we want to be a good neighbor,” Chakka said.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-202451.png?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 13:01:46.730484

The fist-pumping billionaire is buzzing, testing the limits of his safety line.

Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest, the minted miner turned renewable energy zealot, has made a life pushing the boundaries.

He's been up the turbine longer than expected, and behind calm faces, his minders make mental tweaks to the day's schedule.

After a socially intense morning of handshaking, backslapping and small talk, the bloke is probably happy to have a moment to himself. Alone at the top.

Hours earlier, Forrest jetted in from overseas and choppered up to cut the ribbon at Clarke Creek, the biggest wind farm opened in Australia this year.

It's something of an achievement given the growing political and community resistance slowing down the rollout of big renewable projects.

""I'd just love it if every Australian could get up here — it's just the most beautiful feeling in the world,"" Forrest says after finally descending and de-harnessing.

It is the middle of a heatwave, and a hot wind has started whistling through the blades of the nearly 100 wind turbines dotted along the Broadsound Range, between Rockhampton and Mackay.

""It's just this strong, gentle breeze — the beautiful state of Queensland rolling out over these incredibly gracious wind towers,"" Forrest says, like he's been meditating up there.

""It's just slowly evolving, and you know that they're doing so much good every time they turn … it's an emotional feeling.""

You can almost picture Forrest on his private jet, unwrapping his new high-vis Squadron Energy shirt, ""Andrew"" embroidered on the chest.

The work boots he wears are fresh out of the box, too. The worn-in kit is probably still at the back door of the homestead at the family's Minderoo Station, in Western Australia.

""I grew up with the mentorship of two old stockmen — one was Indigenous, one was white,"" Forrest says.

""They both really stressed … you've got to do your best in life, you have to be as useful as you can.""

As a boy on the cattle station, Forrest was given the Aboriginal name Nyidinghu, meaning youngest in the family, and offered some simple advice:

""Don't not enjoy it, mate,"" he recalls his mentors telling him.

“I think the younger Nyidie … would think, 'Yeah, alright mate, now have a proper crack.'""

While Forrest may have been tight with the local mob on Minderoo, having a crack has created serious tensions with the traditional owners of land he's since made billions from.

The legal battle between Fortescue Metals Group and the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation has been going for years, with a landmark federal court decision looming on a $1.8 billion damages claim.

Forrest will deal with that when he has to — today, there's a performance to deliver.

In front of a press pack, he could have been holding court at a stock camp.

Fending off attempts to draw out a headline-worthy political punch, he praises the media for ""barbecuing"" the climate change-denying Donald Trump.

Mining billionaires and the conservative side of politics are often seen as a natural fit, but Twiggy has short shrift for the Coalition decision to ditch a net zero target, in fact he wants to go much further.

""There's an excrement which my cattle put out regularly which I'd call net zero,"" he says.

""Net [zero] allows for a whole heap of fakery, for a whole heap of ducking and dodging and spinning yarns just to make a quid or two.""

Instead of relying on offsets to reduce carbon emissions, Forrest is ploughing ahead with a plan to make his iron ore operations ""real zero"" — electrifying his fleet of machinery, ramping up renewable energy input and battery storage, and, despite the setbacks, building his own hydrogen-fuelled green steel operation.

On a national level, the massive Clarke Creek Wind Farm, set to include battery storage, solar and another 88 turbines by the time it's complete, will also be a key contributor to Australia's goal of reaching 82 per cent renewable energy generation by 2030.

But the transition is getting harder. There is growing pushback from political opponents and some rural community groups, who are understandably stunned at the scale of the industrialisation of once-quiet country areas.

Since the change of government at last year's Queensland election, there has been a notable decline in enthusiasm for the renewables transition.

Coal-fired power stations have had their lifetimes extended, while legislated targets for renewable energy have been dumped, with several projects put on ice.

Just a few years ago, Forrest was standing over a shovel at a world-leading hydrogen electrolyser plant in Gladstone, preaching about how the technology would transform the energy industry.

Today, that project has been scrapped, with the state government looking to recoup the $65 million in taxpayer funds already invested.

Presumably, this was just part of Forrest ""having a proper crack"". He accepts there are ""hard roads ahead"" for hydrogen, but failure only seems to fire the man.

""Success isn't a formula, it's being prepared to tolerate failure time and time again,"" Forrest says.

""The fast track to success is failing your way — failing your way to success, failing the way to the top.""

The bottom of the hill

Forrest's wind farm is just one of many renewable projects under construction on the Broadsound Range.

Last year, investment in the renewable energy sector hit a historic $12.7 billion. The main problem now is finding the people to build it.

Most of the workforce executing the visions of mega investors like Forrest are new to town, living on site in demountable camp accommodation.

Among them is Bull, who's part of a construction team working on a nearby solar farm.

""There's a lot of big projects about to start that support renewables, but getting them across the line and keeping people employed seems to be hard at the minute,"" Bull says.

""I've seen a lot of lack of coordination — they all seem to start at the same time, and then there's always a lack of manpower.""

But there's plenty of work if you want it.

When there's downtime, Bull and his workmates enjoy returning to real life. As the sun sets, they join truckies and tourists taking a break overnight at the makeshift campground behind the Marlborough Hotel.

""It's demanding at times, but it's nothing we're not used to — hot, windy,"" Bull says.

""We come to get away from the camp just for our own personal time.""

Despite some of the hostile signage and political corflutes in the region, he reckons the workforce at least is largely welcome.

""It's keeping a lot of people employed through a stagnant civil construction industry at the minute, because I know where I live, it's a little bit quiet,"" Bull says.

""Generally, the blokes on the projects have a great relationship with the locals … the political side of it is more in the development approvals.

The township of Marlborough is a quiet, peaceful place — aside from the odd train that roars through.

For Sue Bruce, the owner of Grandma's Groceries and Cafe, it has been home for two decades.

""We're cattle-raising country, but with old-fashioned country values,"" she says.

Between wrangling rowdy kids after school and haggling over the price of a slurpy depending on available cash, Sue is a sounding board for locals.

""We look after each other … look after your mates, we still bring a plate to functions,"" she says.

Between Grandma's and the pub next door, this is the main supply point and beer-drinking destination for the workforce at the surrounding solar and wind farms.

""It brings in a huge volume of itinerant workers … which brings extra camps … puts pressure on the already existing services of a small community,"" Sue says.

She's not against the renewables industry taking over parts of the area — from all accounts, she's been able to squeeze money out of companies like Forrest's Squadron Energy to help support community events.

But there is the perennial problem all regional towns around Australia rank as number one: the bloody roads.

""The roads are crumbling,"" Sue says.

""Roads are our biggest concern because the trucks are going over that old highway that was never built to sustain those weights.""

Marlborough sits just off the Bruce Highway, between Rockhampton and Mackay, at the nexus of three council areas. It's in the Livingstone Shire, which has far fewer ratepayers than the big cities to the north and south — and presumably, less to spend on the roads.

Maybe a Fortescue Roads company could be Forrest's next venture?

It is the subject of many a conversation outside Grandma's, and one that a chat with cattle producer Mandy White soon turns to.

""We were having problems before wind farms came along,"" she says.

""So to have that on top, particularly over the range where it's a narrow road and it's in bad need of repair …""

But Mandy, too, has benefited from the community grants offered by the renewable companies, and hopes that in the long term, the industry will help underpin her town.

Sue is hoping the energy transition might see another family like hers choose to relocate to Marlborough.

""We need sustainability, we need people to not come and go, we need people to stay,"" she says.

The growing pains of industrialisation

For a long time, this part of Queensland has been known for cattle and coal, with both industries commanding a certain loyalty.

But as big resources companies like Rio Tinto commit to ambitious carbon reduction targets, the area is also leading the way with power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy companies, driving future development in the region.

Coal isn't dead yet, but the demands of renewable companies are changing the dynamics of nearby industrial centres like Rockhampton.

James Selman has been working as a boilermaker in Rocky for the last 15 years. Recently, his company has begun writing some big invoices for renewable energy projects.

""We've built a lot of framework for solar farms — quite a lot, maybe about a thousand frames,"" he says, casting a line into the Fitzroy River.

""It's a growing demand, everybody wants solar in this region.""

One of his set lines starts to bend violently. A fish breaks the water, and there's a brief hope it could be a decent sized barramundi or threadfin salmon.

As it gets closer to the bank, the head of a small bull shark breaches the surface. The trace jags on a tooth and it's lost to the river.

Rockhampton is hoping to host the 2032 Olympic rowing around here, provided Queensland senator Matt Canavan can convince the committee that crocodiles won't be an issue.

But arguably the hottest topic around town is renewables. Senator Canavan and his Nationals colleague Michelle Landry, the local member for Capricornia, are among the most vocal political critics.

James is too busy working or fishing to be caught up in that.

""I don't really follow it, but I think maybe they're trying to cover themselves,"" he ponders.

It's difficult to distil what's driving this regional resistance into one simple truth.

Much of the anti-renewables rhetoric that generates headlines is tangled with political interest or framed in a way that amplifies the city-country cultural divide.

Research has shown there is a gap in public perceptions here, too. Broadly, views on climate change and renewable energy in regional and rural areas are similar to those of city-dwellers, but people believe they're different.

Renewables proponents argue this is part of a strategic campaign to mislead people into believing regional Australians, and specifically farmers, oppose renewable energy.

It's familiar subject matter for social researcher Rebecca Huntley, who has been spending lots of time talking to people in communities on the frontline of the renewables rollout.

""The biggest thing people say is, don't make the problems we have worse, and do the kinds of things that will help us trust that you'll actually deliver on the promises that you're making to the local community,” she says.

Generally, Dr Huntley says about 5 to 15 per cent of people who live in renewable energy zones (REZ) are ""angry enough to join a Facebook group"".

""Some of that resistance is just resistance, and some of it's genuine,"" she says.

Dr Huntley estimates about 20 to 30 per cent are generally supportive of the renewable energy transition and the associated economic activity, and the rest are unsure or ""hopeful it'll be OK"".

""The reality is there's probably more support than opposition, but the predominant sense is: 'I don't really know what's happening, what's the plan, and what is the local benefit?'"" she says.

There's certainly some ""genuine"" resistance around Rockhampton.

A large battery energy storage project, or BESS, in the nearby community of Bouldercombe has recently been rejected by the local council after intense community pushback.

Coalition figures and community groups have also been raising concerns about the associated environmental destruction involved with building big wind projects.

""I just think that there is a political game here with the anxieties, including the justified anxieties of communities about what is going to happen with these projects and whether they're actually going to bestow a real lasting benefit,"" Dr Huntley says.

""This is the growing pains of the transition — but if we don't get it right, it could be more than just growing pains, it could be real buyer's remorse for some of these communities.""

At the top of the range, Andrew Forrest is reaching the end of his sermon.

""I'd like to see every renewable energy company do what Squadron has done, which is put money straight back into the community,"" he proclaims.

""Build out mobile networks, build out cheap electricity systems, give people $1,000 rebates if they're within 20 kilometres.""

It's worth pointing out there aren't many people living within that radius of Forrest's wind farm, but perhaps it's something.

""Wind farms are a wonderful future, solar farms are a wonderful future, but when they connect to cities, then we must recognise that those connections also are a cost to people.""

RWE has completed construction of its first project in Louisiana, the 100 MW Lafitte Solar facility in Ouachita Parish near Monroe. The project will be fully operational by the end of the year and is backed by a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with Meta, which will receive all associated environmental benefits, including RECs.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held with Monroe Mayor Friday Ellis, parish officials, RWE leadership, employees, and EPC partner McCarthy Building Companies. Over its lifetime, Lafitte Solar is expected to generate roughly $32 million in local tax revenue, supporting schools, law enforcement, and emergency services. Construction created more than 150 peak jobs and supplied meaningful economic activity for local businesses throughout the project.

Andrew Flanagan, CEO, RWE Clean Energy, said, “Lafitte Solar is RWE’s first project in Louisiana, and will provide low-cost, homegrown energy to the Louisiana grid and generate enough electricity to power 17,000 local homes and businesses. By providing affordable and reliable electricity, we are strengthening Monroe’s power supply while supporting the community’s growth and resilience.”

This migration is reshaping the U.S. business landscape, with firms citing lower taxes, a business-friendly environment, and a growing talent pool as key attractions. According to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas led the nation in business relocations from 2010 to 2019, generating more jobs from these moves than any other state (Dallasfed.org).

The trend has accelerated post-pandemic, with over 200 companies relocating or expanding to Texas since 2020. High-profile moves include Tesla’s headquarters shift to Austin in 2021, Oracle’s relocation from Redwood City to Austin in 2020, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s move to Spring, Texas. These shifts are not isolated; they reflect broader economic incentives, including no state income tax and regulatory relief, as highlighted in a compilation by Build Remote (Buildremote.co).

The Pull of Economic Incentives

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has actively promoted the state as a hub for business, noting in a post on X that Texas accounts for about half of all U.S. headquarters relocations. This is supported by data showing Texas as home to 55 Fortune 500 companies, the highest in the nation, per U.S. Global Investors on X. Companies like Charles Schwab and Chevron have also made the move, drawn by tax breaks and lower operational costs.

Recent news underscores this momentum. Coinbase announced in November 2025 that it is shifting its incorporation from Delaware to Texas, following Tesla’s lead, as reported by CNBC. The crypto platform’s legal chief cited Texas’s business-friendly laws in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, emphasizing protections against fiduciary duty lawsuits (CNBC).

Tech Titans Lead the Charge

The technology sector has been particularly active in this exodus. Apple is planning a 250,000-square-foot AI server factory in Houston, joining Meta, HP, and Samsung in expanding Texas operations. Mario Nawfal noted on X that Texas tech jobs have grown 4.7%, signaling a shift from Silicon Valley to what some call the ‘Silicon Prairie’ (ARC Relocation).

Nasdaq’s announcement of a new regional headquarters in Texas further illustrates Wall Street’s pivot. This follows the New York Stock Exchange’s plans for a Texas-based exchange, as posted by Mario Nawfal on X. The Daily Mail reported on Coinbase’s move as part of a broader ‘blue-state exodus’ driven by regulatory burdens (Daily Mail Online).

Beyond Tech: Diverse Industries Join In

Energy and finance sectors are also relocating. GAF Energy, a solar panel company, is leaving California for Georgetown, Texas, consolidating operations amid rising costs in the Bay Area, according to the Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles Times). In finance, major banks are building massive complexes in Dallas, with employment poised to rival New York levels, as noted in X posts from users like LillianRaisedMe.

The Texas Tribune reported that from 2010 to 2019, Texas generated more jobs from relocations than any other state, with anecdotal evidence suggesting continued growth post-pandemic (Texas Tribune). Success magazine outlined reasons for 2025 moves, including a skilled workforce and infrastructure investments (Success).

Challenges Amid the Boom

While the influx brings economic benefits, it’s not without hurdles. Rapid growth in cities like Frisco, forecasted as Texas’s top mover destination in 2026 by MoveBuddha and reported in Frisco Enterprise, strains infrastructure and housing (Frisco Enterprise). Business Insider’s list of major relocations highlights how Texas competes with Florida for these shifts, driven by similar pro-business climates (Business Insider).

X posts from users like Allegra Fox discuss financial firms escaping New York’s costs, predicting Texas as a financial powerhouse by 2028. Charterhouse Square noted over 200 headquarters moves to Texas in the past five years, including Tesla and Oracle.

Policy and Cultural Shifts Driving Migration

Texas’s 2023 law allowing companies to cap fiduciary duty lawsuits has been pivotal, as seen in Coinbase’s decision, per X user RumDoxyTheatre. David Draper on X described this as the ‘Dexit’ trend, with Delaware losing ground due to less predictable courts.

iOptimize Realty explains that Texas’s no-income-tax policy and business environment make it irresistible to Fortune 500 firms (iOptimize Realty). Posts on X from Bethaliza highlight Texas as America’s new financial frontier, with Wall Street firms expanding beyond traditional hubs.

Future Implications for U.S. Business

The migration is fostering innovation hubs in Austin and Dallas, rivaling Silicon Valley. AKA OMA JI EGO’s X post notes Texas’s 130% growth in five years through targeted incentives, offering lessons for other regions.

As more companies like those listed in Business Insider’s roundup continue to relocate, Texas’s economic dominance seems set to grow.

Goldman Sachs estimates that the AI industry needs to spend $1.4 trillion in the United States by 2030 on power and utilities for its AI scaling bet.
Data centers should pay these incremental capacity costs they impose on the system, rather than having them allocated to all retail customers generally.
The secretary of Energy’s emphasis on making AI data centers pay the costs they impose on the system is welcome.
Secretary Wright’s proposal is forward-looking, but it must be implemented in a way that assures AI data centers pay their fair share.","Secretary of Energy Chris Wright recently sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission directing it to open a rulemaking to facilitate access to the electrical grid by both new generating facilities and AI data centers. The proposed rule would make data centers “responsible for 100 percent” of certain costs they impose on the energy system.

This is the right direction for a national energy policy that would accommodate the needs of the AI industry and potentially help protect ordinary ratepayers from the costs and risks of upgrading the energy system for AI data centers.

Our major concern is protecting the residential and non-data center ratepayers, which is also increasingly the concern of political leaders running for office. But that is not the focus of the Energy secretary’s proposal.

Perhaps out of deference to state ratemaking authority, the word “ratepayer” does not appear in either his letter or his notice of proposed rulemaking. Without a consumer focus, the implementation of the secretary’s plan has the potential to force ordinary ratepayers to subsidize the AI experiments and energy demands of some of the world’s richest corporations.

AI companies’ plans for gigantic data centers constitute a questionable bet that scaling, that is, more computation for training AI models, will by itself produce breakthrough AI models possessing artificial general intelligence, models with capacities to match or exceed human cognitive capabilities across the board.

Increasing numbers of experts including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, AI pioneer Yann Lecun and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence warn that transformative AI will require a new approach beyond doubling down on today’s machine learning models.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt thinks a better approach would be to downplay the vast computational bet on scaling and concentrate on applying today’s models to today’s very real social needs, an approach adopted by China.

But the industry is intent on its scaling plan and has the resources to finance it. In their most recent earnings reports Google, Meta and Microsoft announced plans to accelerate capital spending in the coming years, focused primarily on AI data centers, and funded out of the companies’ own cash flow or high-quality corporate bonds.

The limiting factor, however, might be energy. The huge data centers the AI industry envisages are needed primarily for developing more capable AI systems, not for running existing ones in response to everyday use by businesses and consumers.

Utilities will be challenged to meet this demand given the magnitude and accelerated timing of AI company requests. Goldman Sachs estimates that the AI industry needs to spend $1.4 trillion in the United States by 2030 on power and utilities for its AI scaling bet.

Data center AI energy demands are already poised to impose future costs on retail customers if steps are not taken to prevent this. In the capacity auction held by grid operator PJM in July 2025, projections of data center energy demand drove up system-wide energy capacity costs by $7.3 billion, or 82 percent, according to a report by Monitoring Analytics.

Data centers should pay these incremental capacity costs they impose on the system, rather than having them allocated to all retail customers generally.

The secretary of Energy’s emphasis on making AI data centers pay the costs they impose on the system is welcome. But a lot depends on the details such as which costs are allocated to the data centers, when they will have to pay them and what happens if they no longer need the power.

How can ratepayers be protected from the risks of stranded investment if the industry’s AI scaling bet proves to be unfounded?

One idea comes from a recent request from the utility Peco that FERC approve a transmission security agreement between the utility and Amazon requiring revenue guarantees regardless of whether Amazon ultimately uses the power and early termination fees. The utility ComEd has a similar plan for AI data center revenue guarantees and other safeguards to protect ordinary customers

These revenue guarantee proposals might not be sufficient to fully protect ratepayers. As Monitor Analytics points out in asking FERC to deny Peco’s petition, the utility has not done an assessment of whether there is adequate generation capacity to provide for the power Amazon says it needs. But the framework of revenue guarantees is a step in the right direction.

Secretary Wright’s proposal is forward-looking, but it must be implemented in a way that assures AI data centers pay their fair share. As his proposals and others at FERC and before state regulators around the country move forward, legislators, public interest groups, academics and think tanks need to keep the focus on protecting the ratepayer, not simply clearing out the underbrush for the AI industry.

The renewable energy sector has faced a tough time trying to persuade the US President to change his stance and embrace the sector.
The US is in danger of meeting the global embrace of the hydrogen sector, with other nations setting their sights on becoming hydrogen hubs in the near future, such as the Middle East.","The ongoing political tension between the current US President and California’s Governor is reaching a fever pitch. President Trump has essentially cut funding for a massive hydrogen hub in the Golden State, and industry experts, along with Gavin Newsom, have lamented the position taken by the current administration. Now, it has emerged that in response to the cuts in federal funding, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) will immediately halt hydrogen hub activities in California, undermining the US energy transition.

The federal government, under Donald Trump, has cut funding for hydrogen development in California

Hydrogen has become the most viable form of energy generation in the world, but has faced some significant challenges in certain regions of the globe, none more than in the United States. While the rest of the world embraces the potential of the renewable energy sector with open arms, the US has seen its federal government recently cut off funding for hydrogen hubs in California, and could potentially do the same in other US states.

The reports are that due to the funding cuts pioneered by the Trump administration, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems has halted plans to develop a hydrogen hub in the Golden State and has handed over administrative oversight to the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) and the University of California.

“While this change reflects shifting federal investments, California remains firmly committed to developing a renewable hydrogen ecosystem as part of its broader clean energy transition. Clean hydrogen can play a pivotal role in helping the state move away from fossil fuels, driving innovation and supporting healthier, more sustainable communities. – statement from ARCHES

Trump is waging a policy war with the Golden State of California

The move by the federal government to cancel approximately $1.2 billion in funds for California’s planned hydrogen hub points to a more concerning state of affairs in the US. Trump has been waging a theoretical war against his detractors, and California is being hit the hardest. Mr Trump recently sent ICE agents to LA to clamp down on undocumented immigrants.

That has been followed up by a recent vote in the California halls of power to redistrict several areas that would give the Democrats five more seats in Congress, effectively canceling out a similar move in Texas. The response from the Trump administration has been to cut off billions of federal funding for the planned hydrogen hub in California, which would have turned the US into a global leader in the sector.

The renewable energy sector has faced a tough time trying to persuade the US President to change his stance and embrace the sector. The US is in danger of meeting the global embrace of the hydrogen sector, with other nations setting their sights on becoming hydrogen hubs in the near future, such as the Middle East.

Legacy automakers, meanwhile, must thread this needle while simultaneously investing in and profiting from their internal combustion portfolios.
Clear Eyes Win There lies the fundamental problem for legacy car companies.
Gas car companies and electric car companies aren’t just building different devices, they’re building different ecosystems.
Maybe legacy automakers can find away around these problems.","Tesla changed the world in 2012. The company existed long before that. But that was the year when the company proved its thesis. The brand launched the Model S, creating a brand new product category out of whole cloth, and blowing countless others to bits with its all-electric super sedan.

Through iterative improvements, Tesla would go on to build the world’s best-selling premium sedan, its best-selling EV, its best-selling luxury sedan, its best-selling SUV and its best selling vehicle, period, depending on the year. It is worth more than every other car company combined

Yet most of the so-called “legacy” automakers have not been able to follow its lead. None of them build EVs at a consistent profit. And none of them are quite ready to build the whole system, as Tesla does.

When Tesla built the Model S, it also built up a sales, service and charging ecosystem that made owning one pleasant. Many automakers still haven't learned how to do that with EVs.

End-To-End

Last month, I took a road trip in a 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT. It is the absolute best EV that any “legacy” automaker sells in the U.S. It is the best you can do, if you don’t “build the full stack.”

The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT is one of the best EVs made by a ""legacy"" automaker.

But Tesla builds the whole stack. There’s a robust charging infrastructure that is more seamless than any non-Tesla system at typically far lower prices. The vehicles are purchased from no-haggle company stores, not dealerships with high-pressure finance departments. The cars integrate seamlessly with your home, your power grid, your solar panels. The only good hotel chargers in the country seem to have “Tesla” logos, as do the best home batteries.

This is weaponizing the core advantage of EVs: You use power everywhere. So your universal power bank should follow you everywhere. The more services you can connect to it, the more money you are going to make.

Tesla is increasingly integrating its solar, home energy and vehicle products.

Hyundai wants to do all of that. But it is its own fiefdom inside a conglomerate that is responsible for 11% of South Korea’s economy. It has the money and the stamina to do this, but it isn’t there yet. It wants to build up a full software and energy platform that integrates with the infrastructure and with other smart devices. But for now, in the auto sphere, it simply builds great EVs.

So when I set out on a 650-mile road trip this past weekend, I knew not to bother with Hyundai’s included route-planning software. I loaded up A Better Route Planner—an app now owned by Rivian, a competitor that builds most of its own stack—and used that instead. But since it wasn’t built by Hyundai, and the XRT is brand new, it didn’t know how efficient I’d be. And since the best app for doing this isn’t integrated with the Hyundai, my car wasn’t actively updating the plan with its real-world battery consumption.

More and more EVs have access to Tesla Superchargers. But on my Ioniq 5 road trip, I realized that charging third-party EVs still isn't as consistent as charging a Tesla.

Photo by: Suvrat Kothari

A Tesla does all of that automatically, and routes you only through the best chargers, because it only uses the ubiquitous Tesla Superchargers. Aha, Hyundai fans may say, but the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 can use Superchargers. It even has a native Tesla-style NACS plug, another sign of the brand’s utter dominance in this space. Yet even this didn’t solve its charging problems.

The first two Superchargers I visited refused to initiate the charging session. I tried on the Tesla app and using the supposedly automatic plug-and-charge feature. Neither worked. Because Superchargers were originally built for native back-end Tesla magic to sort everything out, there’s no way to identify or rectify faults. I called my contact at Hyundai, who gave me the default, scripted advice. When that didn’t work, I bailed to a Rivian-branded charger in a disused parking lot, and plugged in yet another adapter.

Rivian is also building its own charging network, albeit on a much smaller scale.

Photo by: InsideEVs

On the way home, I tried to use Hyundai’s route-planning software. It directed me to a CalTrans charger in the middle of the desert. The charger in question had one stall, operated at 50 kw—about one-fifth of the maximum charging speed of the car—and, most notably, has been closed for months for a construction project. It was also 25 miles from the nearest charger and the car’s efficiency declined as I drove, so if I had followed the Hyundai’s guidance, I would have likely ended up stranded in the Mojave desert.

It doesn’t matter how good the rest of the car is. If you can’t plug in a destination and trust the vehicle to figure out a reliable and efficient route, it’s not good enough.

A Long, Pricey Road

Representatives from Hyundai, General Motors and Ford et. al. will all explain how unfair it is to judge their cars by the condition of the infrastructure. They aren’t in the business of building gas stations, and that never stopped them. Why, suddenly, do EV companies have to be infrastructure companies, too?

Well, because EVs aren’t gas cars. They’re a new business, with new opportunities. And while automakers don’t have to build charging stations, home power systems and home charging setups, they should want to. If electric energy is the main way we accomplish work in the future—and, arguably, it already is—then you don’t want a piece of that pie. You want to own the pie shop.

Google is also trying to solve route planning. It wants to use its Gemini AI chatbot to direct you toward charging stations with specific food options, or amenities.

Tesla owns its bakery. But getting there was expensive and tough. Many automakers have still not caught on to the opportunity here. (I won’t name names because I don’t want to piss anyone off at Honda, Toyota or Stellantis.) Others are just now starting the journey Tesla set out on over a decade ago.

Among them, I’d wager that General Motors shows the most promise. The company already has a mature EV platform with a mostly-common software stack and good route-planning, albeit with a heavy assist from Google. It also has a real home-energy product, charging partnerships with EVGo, a stake in the Ionna charging network and a robust battery supply chain. It recently announced further pushes into home energy and robotics.

Brands like BMW, Hyundai, General Motors, Toyota and Honda have partnered up to build Ionna, a nationwide charging network. That's a good step in the right direction.

Photo by: Suvrat Kothari

Competitors have bets in some of these places. Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, Honda, Kia, Hyundai and Stellantis all invested in Ionna, and a few are working on their own charging products. But no one is near the scale or maturity of Tesla, and you can feel that every time you use their cars.

That’s because this isn’t an easy road. Tesla had the luxury of losing billions of dollars for years to make the business model attainable in the long term. Legacy automakers, meanwhile, must thread this needle while simultaneously investing in and profiting from their internal combustion portfolios.

Clear Eyes Win

There lies the fundamental problem for legacy car companies. Gas car companies and electric car companies aren’t just building different devices, they’re building different ecosystems. Every part of building, selling and servicing EVs is different, and the more you’re configured for selling gas vehicles, the harder it is to take advantage of these changes.

Tesla and Rivian have another key advantage over legacy rivals: They control their own retail networks, rather than relying on dealers for customer relations. That means it's much easier for the companies to educate and assist buyers.

Photo by: Rivian

How can you drive out cost if your tech has to be backwards-compatible with gas vehicles? How can you have top-tier over-the-air update capability if you’re supporting a bunch of cars that can’t quietly turn on to install them? How can you sell someone a $50,000 car without building a software tool that can guide it anywhere in the country?

Maybe legacy automakers can find away around these problems. They can build good-enough EVs until the infrastructure and supply chain matures, than take advantage of the lessons learned by companies that actually innovate.

But that’s a dangerous strategy. EV buyers tend to be loyal, and so if you miss the window to sell someone their first EV, you might not be in the conversation to sell them their second. You need a great product as fast as possible. And as Tesla has proven, if you can’t rely on infrastructure and software that’s already available, you’re going to have to build it yourself.

Ratepayers in Burgos’ Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills — attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they’ll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.

But the challenges — some say the impossibility — of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.

One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built — eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.

The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that’s ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.

Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas — such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

“There’s speculation in there,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. “Nobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what’s speculative, what’s double-counting, what’s real, what’s not.”

Suspicions about skyrocketing demand

There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.

Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.

One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren’t set in stone or lack the heft — clients, financing or otherwise — to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.

Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.

Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won’t tell utilities if or where they’ve submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.

The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation’s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.

“Better data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,” the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.

Real, speculative, or ‘somewhere in between’

The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.

The coalition’s vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a “fundamental first step of really meeting this moment” of energy growth.

“Wherever we go, the question is, ‘Is the (energy) growth real? How can we be so sure?’” Tinjum said. “And we really view commercial readiness verification as one of those important kind of low-hanging opportunities for us to be adopting at this moment.”

Igal Feibush, the CEO of Pennsylvania Data Center Partners, a data center developer, said utilities are in a “fire drill” as they try to vet a deluge of data center projects all seeking electricity.

The vast majority, he said, will fall off because many project backers are new to the concept and don’t know what it takes to get a data center built.

States also are trying to do more to find out what’s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.

In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.

They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.

Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren’t sure if the power requests “are real or just speculative or somewhere in between.”

Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.

Electricity bills are rising, too

PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.

Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects “are real, they are coming fast and furious” and that the “near-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.”

The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.

Still, PPL’s projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.

Ratepayers in Burgos’ Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills — attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.

That’s why ratepayers need more protection to ensure they are benefiting from the higher cost, Burgos said.

“Once they make their buck, whatever company,” Burgos said, “you don’t see no empathy towards the ratepayers.”

Kathy Hochul’s pivot away from climate policy.","When President Donald Trump returned to office, Democratic governors from the biggest and bluest states pledged to be bulwarks against the dismantling of Biden-era climate and clean energy policies.

But the Democrats’ fervor is showing cracks — as they face legal limits, shape-shifting political realities and economic headwinds.

Take Pennsylvania, where Gov. Josh Shapiro dismayed his green-minded supporters this week by agreeing to withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Northeast’s carbon cap-and-trade program. Shapiro, who’s long been cool toward RGGI, abandoned the climate program as part of a deal to end a months-long budget impasse with Republicans, Adam Aton reports.

“It is time now to look forward, and I’m looking forward to aggressively pushing for policies to create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto our grid and reduce the cost of energy for all Pennsylvanians,” the potential 2028 presidential contender said before signing the budget deal.

Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a natural gas pipeline that Trump supports and signed off on a deal to keep a gas-fueled cryptocurrency mining operation running for five more years, Marie French and Mona Zhang report. “We need to govern in reality,” she said, adding that there’s a “war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation.”

That’s in contrast to an action Hochul took late last year, when she signed the Climate Change Superfund Act, which requires energy-sector carbon polluters to pay for infrastructure improvements over the next 25 years.

More compromises on climate policies may be coming, even after Democrats scored sweeping wins last week in Virginia’s and New Jersey’s gubernatorial elections. That’s because the political balancing act of addressing cost-of-living problems, economic growth and climate policy is getting more complicated, not less.

Democrats recalibrate

California Gov. Gavin Newsom straddles sides of that dynamic. He made a rockstar appearance this week at the United Nations climate talks in Brazil, declaring that he and other supporters of climate action are “at peak influence because of the flatness of the surrounding terrain with the Trump administration and all the anxiety.”

But Newsom faces grumbling at home about how California’s Democratic leaders are standing up for the environment — or not.

The party has retreated on a cap on oil industry profits and clean fuel mandates, seemingly spooked by the potential for higher fuel prices if refineries close. And Newsom’s administration has tried to keep open one key refinery in Northern California.

The next big decision for a Democratic governor may come in Massachusetts. Lawmakers there are advancing, on a bipartisan basis, legislation to significantly water down the state’s major climate commitments, including making its 2030 emissions targets nonbinding and slashing money for energy efficiency.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Marie French breaks down New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s pivot away from climate policy.

COP Corner

A lonely platform: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) arrived at the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, on Friday — making him the sole U.S. federal representative at the U.N.-sponsored talks. The senator says he is trying to show that the American public still broadly supports addressing climate change. Whitehouse on Friday also alleged the State Department helped stymie U.S. lawmakers’ ability to attend the summit.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment but pointed to an earlier statement from a White House official saying that Trump “is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues.”

How Biden’s EV charging program won

Former President Joe Biden’s pledge to have 500,000 electric vehicle chargers on roads by 2030 fell far short — something Trump seized on in the 2024 election. But David Ferris reports that while the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program may have been a political failure, it’s a policy success.

That’s because of the progress made on NEVI’s overriding goal: to ease the charging process for drivers. The program established rules and requirements for chargers to ensure drivers could get the same charging experience wherever they went.

NEVI “forced the entire industry to raise its game around reliability, redundancy and performance that will be remembered as an important legacy,” said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which studies the EV charging network.

EU adopts binding (though weakened) climate targets

European Parliament on Thursday voted to set binding targets for reducing emissions by 2040, with centrist and left-wing lawmakers providing a majority of votes to fend off a push from the far right to kill it, Louise Guillot writes from Brussels.

The target calls for the European Union to reduce its emissions 85 percent compared with 1990 levels. The other 5 percent can be outsourced abroad through carbon offsets.

The target is a “solid compromise ... that combines environmental ambition with economic competitiveness,” said Lídia Pereira, a Portuguese member of Parliament.

Downsizing EPA

Nearly a fifth of the Environmental Protection Agency’s workforce has opted into the Trump administration’s mass resignation plan, Kevin Bogardus reports.

About 2,620 employees have taken the “deferred resignation” offer at EPA, according to figures the agency shared with POLITICO’s E&E News on Friday. EPA has reviewed all its applications for the program, including all four rounds offered this year.

More than 17 percent of EPA staff, a sizable chunk of its head count, has left or will leave by the end of this year as part of the resignation program.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

DATA CENTERS ARE THREATENING GRIDS

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

DATA CENTERS MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

NATION’S LARGEST GRID OPERATOR HAS A PROPOSAL

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency. That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A DEAL IS SHROUDED IN SECRECY

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route. The electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract in August with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public, and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ELECTRICITY

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/091625_AIStrainPowergrid_01_TedShaffrey.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 06:57:42.094021

In rescinding the Biden-era regulations, the Interior Department returned to management guidelines originally established in 1977, making it significantly easier to permit drilling and mining operations. This marks the latest step in the Trump administration’s push to focus U.S. energy policy on oil, gas and coal, after Biden prioritized renewable energy and environmental conservation.

“This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release. Burgum added that the action will “create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security.”

A final rule will be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 17, the Interior Department said.

What is the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska?

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska sits about 600 miles north of Anchorage. It is the largest single tract of public land in the United States and provides habitat for grizzly and polar bears, caribou and thousands of migratory birds.

Congress set aside the reserve in 1923 as an emergency petroleum supply. In 1976, Congress authorized commercial development while requiring protection of fish, wildlife and habitat.

Who supports and who opposes the decision?

Alaska Republican officials celebrated the announcement. Gov. Mike Dunleavy called it “yet another step in the right direction for Alaska and American energy dominance,” according to the New York Times. Sen. Dan Sullivan described it as “a new day filled with opportunity for Alaskans.”

Nearly 55,000 people submitted comments opposing the repeal during the 60-day comment period, according to Earthjustice.

But in the decades since those heady days, plastic has developed a particularly bad reputation when it comes to sustainability.
In 2024, the UN's Secretary-General António Guterres said that the world is ""choking on plastic"", alluding to the chronic problem of plastic pollution.
""Earning the EcoVadis Gold Medal is a significant milestone that underscores our deep commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices,"" he says.
This means that plastic pollution will likely double to 44 million tonnes a year.","Bakelite, the Atlanta-based manufacturer known for producing the world's first ever 100% synthetic plastic, is often credited with kickstarting the age of plastics.

Bakelite resin was revolutionary from the moment it was first created, all the way back in 1907. The material quickly became familiar to millions, thanks to its applications in household goods like telephones, radios, jewellery and much more.

But in the decades since those heady days, plastic has developed a particularly bad reputation when it comes to sustainability. In 2024, the UN's Secretary-General António Guterres said that the world is ""choking on plastic"", alluding to the chronic problem of plastic pollution.

According to the OECD, just 9% of the world's plastic is recycled, with the rest filling landfills, incinerators or our oceans. What's more, scientists from the UN estimate that plastics may take more than 500 years to fully decompose.

So, with this in mind, it would be safe to assume that a plastic producer would struggle to be sustainable. Bakelite, however, is shrugging off this assumption.

Why Bakelite has been recognised for its sustainability

The firm was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal by sustainability ratings platform EcoVadis, positioning the thermoset resin manufacturer among the top 5% of all the 130,000 companies assessed worldwide for sustainability.

This recognition can be chalked up to Bakelite's new policies, its operational improvements and the expanded scope of its public reporting.

The firm has also made some big investments in infrastructure recently, including solar panel installations at its sites in Barry in Wales, Lantarón in Spain and Kitee in Finland, as well as a steam turbine at the firm's Botlek facility in the Netherlands.

There have also been several initiatives aimed at reusing water at Bakelite's sites in Oregon and a new chiller system in Louisville that is designed to reduce water consumption.

Bakelite's acquisition strategy

Bakelite's President and CEO JP Aucoin points to the company's recent acquisition of Sestec, describing the bio-based adhesives manufacturer of wood and composite materials as an important reason for the firm's trajectory.

""Earning the EcoVadis Gold Medal is a significant milestone that underscores our deep commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices,"" he says.

""Our recent acquisition of Sestec, a leader in bio-based adhesives for wood and composite materials, together with this recognition, reinforces our dedication to helping customers achieve their sustainability goals.""

The company's sustainability performance was driven by participation in initiatives including Responsible Care and ISCC Plus certification programmes.

Can plastic manufacturers improve recycling?

Despite all the furore and the calls for plastic production to slow, the OECD predicts that global plastic use is going to triple from 2019 levels by 2060. This means that plastic pollution will likely double to 44 million tonnes a year.

Naturally, manufacturers like Bakelite are under pressure from institutional investors when it comes to this subject, with many investors becoming more and more focused on environmental performance, including renewable plastics use, recycling, waste management and bio-based raw materials.

Advanced recycling technologies like chemical recycling and pyrolysis are under development, breaking down plastics into basic components for producing high-quality recycled materials.

That said, the transition to a fully circular economy is going to require huge capital investments, the kind of which many companies are struggling to justify against immediate financial pressures.

Bakelite, though, appears to be taking a proactive approach to the matter.

“We know that our dedication to sustainability will help us become a stronger company while also making a positive impact on our planet,” explains JP.

The company has a long way to go and many responsibilities to fulfil before it can be considered wholly sustainable, but it is clear that it is making an effort to move the dial.

As David Attenborough says: “Industrial pollution and the discarding of plastic waste must be tackled for the sake of all life in the ocean.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/aa410c9ec0958bfbfcb3a24912ac94e7:a94da347dd063f184cd4e558a0c8c8a3/the-ecovadis-gold-medal-is-a-coveted-award-in-the-world-of-coporate-sustainability.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 11:04:48.102116

The state’s largest utility company sought to use the procedure to help finance the construction of two new natural gas turbines at its Horseshoe Lake Power Plant in eastern Oklahoma County. While OG&E received preapproval to build them and eventually charge customers for the cost, regulators specifically denied the use of CWIP.

Commissioners deliberated whether they were obligated to approve the mechanism under a new law requiring the Corporation Commission to allow CWIP for new or expanded natural gas infrastructure. But the law wasn’t applicable in this case, the regulators said, because OG&E filed its application before Senate Bill 998 went into effect.

Why did OG&E want to charge customers during construction?

The utility company wanted to buy more energy generation capacity, driven by rising electricity demand and the retirement of older facilities.

OG&E laid out plans to build the natural gas turbines, purchase power from a gas-fired generation facility in Pittsburg County and enter into a contract with a battery energy storage system facility near Woodward. CWIP collection would have financed the natural gas turbine construction.

Residents would have seen new monthly charges increase incrementally, the company announced, starting with about 60 cents in 2026 and ending with more than $4 in 2031.

Representatives for OG&E maintained during the length of the case that customers would have saved millions of dollars in interest over the life of the $506 million project.

The savings would total about $176 million, a spokesperson for OG&E said in October.

But commissioners argued that residents wouldn’t see the savings for years.

“The math is so absolutely clear that CWIP treatment is a detriment to rate payers, where if they enjoy any savings at all, it's going to be 25 years and beyond before they get that savings,” Commissioner Todd Hiett said during a Nov. 5 meeting.

“ Those customers may not be customers, they may not be alive. Those businesses may not be alive.”

Corporation commissioners disagreed on which final document to vote on

Commissioner Brian Bingman proposed an order that denied CWIP, but still granted preapproval to construct the turbines and buy power from two other facilities. His document also gave OG&E until July 2026 to draft a large-load tariff, which keeps residential customers from paying the same amount as facilities like manufacturing plants or data centers.

Bingman’s document also allowed OG&E to charge customers for 18 months once the new turbines are in service. After that, the company could include remaining costs in a general rate case.

But Hiett condemned the new order in favor of an older version, saying some new language came from OG&E. Hiett brought his own proposed order.

“I was just shocked to see the monopoly utility swoop in after the record is closed, and after a robust hearing, the company swoops in and completely rewrites the order,” Hiett said.

The two primary changes in the document involve extending the window for the large-load tariff filing and increasing the number of months the company can charge customers for the turbines before entering a new rate case, according to Louis Jackson, assistant and advisor to Bingman.

Proposed orders aren’t typically made public unless voted upon. StateImpact has not independently verified the changes.

“Both PSO and OG&E have been working for several years over at the legislature to systematically do two things: Remove themselves from regulation and strengthen their monopoly status,” Hiett said. “They were very successful in removing themselves from regulation last year with Senate Bill 998.”

Hiett said some of the new language was “nothing but propaganda,” urging Bingman and Chairman Kim David not to approve the proposed order.

“They're trying to capture this regulatory body, utilize this regulatory body through an order to promote propaganda, and this order should be rejected on those grounds alone,” Hiett said.

David and Bingman disagreed with Hiett’s comments, saying the changes were not significant.

“I'm highly offended by what you had to say,” David, who joined the meeting virtually, said. “You just basically accused us both of not being genuine, and the changes that were made in this order are not substantial changes.”

David and Bingman voted to approve the order, while Hiett voted against it.

In an email, Ken Miller, vice president of public and regulatory affairs for OG&E, wrote that Hiett’s comments were “baseless.”

“I’ve known Todd for a long time and he has never responded well to not getting his own way,” he wrote. “We take great offense to his characterization of OG&E’s advocacy for critical projects that meet Oklahoma’s growing demand for energy at low costs as highly inappropriate and unacceptable.”

Regulators explored consumer protection options during the case, as energy-hungry facilities like data centers come online

Before the final proposed order, commissioners discussed using three mechanisms meant to keep residential customers from paying the same monthly amount as large facilities: a large-load tariff, a production demand allocation and a true-up adjustment.

A large-load tariff is an agreement between a utility and a high-consumption customer, such as a data center. The tariff ensures bills for big consumers are calculated differently from smaller-load households or businesses.

The protection was included in the commission’s final order, directing OG&E to file a large-load tariff with the regulatory body by July 1. The agreement could be used to set rates as bigger customers come online.

Before the vote to deny OG&E’s request, a stipulation agreement written by the Office of the Attorney General, the commission’s public utility division and the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma included the production demand allocation and true-up mechanisms.

The allocator would update the amount of CWIP money charged to customers every year. As more high-consumption facilities come online, the amount owed by customers with smaller energy footprints would be expected to decrease.

The true-up mechanism would happen after the turbines come online. OG&E would have looked at its energy supply compared to when CWIP was first set. Some residential customers could see a refund in the form of lower bills after the company calculates final project costs.

More CWIP requests likely on the horizon

Although the commission denied its first case of CWIP under Senate Bill 998, more will probably be filed by utilities in the future.

During the Nov. 13 meeting, Bingman said consumer protections could be part of future CWIP cases.

“As you can tell, I was more taken with eliminating the CWIP, which I know we're going to see down the road,” he said. “But I think a lot of these protections that you're talking about, that as we go on down the road, some of those we will be able to put in place.”

In an email, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office wrote OG&E could come back to the commission with another CWIP request.

When asked if OG&E planned to challenge Thursday’s decision, a spokesperson wrote, “The commission and OG&E differed on the relevant effective date of the new law in this specific case. We believe it’s important to save customers a significant amount of money and will work to secure these savings in future cases.”

It’s unclear when the utility plans to file another case. The OG&E spokesperson said timing isn’t finalized for its next general rate review.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5435df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2Fb4%2F16d52e9e445e827e26aa26378f38%2Fimg-9289.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 07:58:22.860375

First Solar Selects South Carolina for New US Production Facility

First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the ""Company"" or ""First Solar"") today announced that it will establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the Company's international fleet. The Company expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility ? which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals ? was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar's capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

""South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,"" said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. ""First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.""

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar's international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar's footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

""The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration's trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,"" said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. ""We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act's stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers' objectives.""

The latest edition1 provides an analysis of global energy and of the implications for energy security, environmental protection and economic development. The WEO uses a scenario-based approach to highlight the key choices, consequences and issues lying ahead and show how the energy system can be affected by the changing energy policies of governments around the world. The present paper identifies main conclusions to draw from this year’s edition in the difficult context of the competitiveness of the EU industry and with the pressing climate urgency in the background.

Energy Security Concerns Persist, but Prices Are Reasonable

Many sources of energy have associated supply security concerns, including the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and the new U.S. administration. The past few years have shown how quickly situations of dependencies can turn into vulnerabilities. This is not only valid for fossil fuels, but also for the more modern clean and renewable technologies. Geopolitical tensions and associated trade tensions are major risks for energy security and for coordinated action on the reduction of emissions.

However, even in this global context with many risks and uncertainties, the price levels of the main energy sources remain reasonable. Oil, for example, is around USD70/bbl and seems to be unaffected by the situation in the Middle East — a factor that has often been a driving factor of oil price spikes and crises in the past. The main reason for this seems to be the large overcapacity in the global oil market, essentially stemming from oil demand not growing as expected in China — something in part attributed to the electrification of Chinese transport. The WEO sees this spare capacity remaining and even growing to 2030, indicating that world oil consumption would flatten at around 100 million barrels per day between now and 2035, before decreasing in a more distant future.

The situation is similar on the global liquefied natural gas (‘LNG’) market, with existing overcapacities that will only grow over the next years with the additional LNG capacities coming online between now and 2030. The WEO analysis comes to the conclusion that it is unclear where these additional LNG capacities will go and meet an increased demand — possibly in Southeast Asia or India. Possibly even backstop European consumption after cessation of Russian pipeline gas imports to Europe, with the US and Qatar holding onto their position as the world’s biggest suppliers in an increasingly complex interplay of market and geopolitical factors.

Competitiveness Issues Threaten the EU Economy

Whilst price levels on the world markets are reasonable, the EU economy is in a very unfavourable competitiveness position compared to other economies, such as that of the United States. The EU industry, which used to have access to relatively cheap Russian pipeline gas, is now relying on more LNG imports, which is more expensive at the global LNG price levels. This has been clearly identified by the Draghi Report.2 The EU industry is facing gas costs several times higher than the U.S. industry, which has access to cheap local gas (often shale gas). This difference in gas prices is also one of the reasons — but not the only one — why power prices are several times higher in the EU than in the United States.

Clean Tech Is Progressing — and So Is Electrification

Although it’s clear that there’s been a large increase in the number of large photovoltaic installations, as well as a swift increase in the use of electric vehicles worldwide, the last year has seen very slow progress in the use of wind energy and a decrease of the rate of deployment of heat pumps, which are essential for the electrification of heating and cooling in the building sector. Hence, a mixed picture.

These clean technologies are now a market of more than USD700 billion, more than half of which is in China — a significant geographical concentration. Additionally, there are fast-growing trade flows from China to Europe that are capable of covering a significant fraction of the EU future energy demand. The WEO states that a sea carrier full of photovoltaic modules carries equipment which will generate as much energy as there is in 50 LNG carriers over its expected lifetime. There is, however, a reason for worry in the fact that Europe is developing a dependency on China in many of these clean technologies, even if it is probably less dangerous than the dependency on gas or oil providers.

Electrification is making quick progress in China, based on the deployment of renewable energy sources, and allows a decrease of the use of coal. This is also taking place in several other large economies, but less so in the United States and the EU. The main drivers for an increased electricity demand are cooling, mobility, data and artificial intelligence. The use of electricity to decarbonise large traditional industrial sectors is not happening at a meaningful scale yet.

Despite Recent Success, Clean Tech Still Faces Obstacles

The current rate of deployment of clean technologies implies more or less stable CO2 emissions between now and 2035, which is clearly not Paris Agreement compatible. Last year looks to have been the warmest year ever since the industrial revolution, and it could well be confirmed as the first year to breach the 1.5°C limit over pre-industrial times. The vast majority of scientists would agree that this 1.5°C temperature increase of the Paris Agreement is now out of reach, and that the 2°C objective will quickly slip out of reach if trajectories are not swiftly modified. We would certainly need many more new renewable capacities, faster progress in efficiency measures and large investments in grids, system smartness and storage to allow electrification to accelerate.

The transition also requires large quantities of minerals and metals, some well-known and some exotic. In a general manner, these markets are not in a situation of overcapacity. They are very often concentrated, from a production and manufacturing point of view, in a reduced number of countries, with a large proportion in China. To take just an example, simple things like the availability of copper could quickly become problematic. Recycling can provide a partial answer, but it seems inevitable that more mining activities should be developed in order to avoid crises of undercapacity or unacceptable dependencies on a reduced number of suppliers.

So, Where Do We Go From Here?

For Europe, increasing its capacity to produce and use clean energy technologies is essential to ensure that the EU remains competitive on the global clean energy technology market. This will bring large benefits to the European economy and its citizens.

The EU is currently facing technological and non-technological challenges, such as high energy prices, critical raw materials supply chain disruptions and skills shortages.

“Africa is not waiting. We are leading.”

This declaration by H.E. Seyoum Mekonen of Ethiopia, served as both a guiding star and call to action at September 2025’s Africa Climate Summit in Addis. It is again relevant as world leaders gather in Belem, Brazil, for COP30 to hold critical discussions on our path forward when it comes to climate and energy. The Global South holds tremendous potential not only in renewable energy adoption but also in leadership, and Africa is an especially meaningful actor in that space.

When it comes to the energy opportunity, Africa is positioned for energy abundance. RMI’s research shows that amid the plethora of energy options available, the continent is well positioned to be a renewable energy superpower, driving growth and prosperity with abundant, low-cost renewable energy. It is an exciting and inspiring moment, but not one without its challenges.

Africa struggles with an aging, expensive, fragile, and unequally distributed infrastructure that dampens economic tailwinds and leaves over 600 million Africans without electricity. More than half of Africans face unreliable electricity supply, and even if grid-connected, consistent access isn’t guaranteed. In fact, the average annual consumption remains far behind the 1,000 kWh modern energy minimum. Electricity demand is only projected to grow, with an expected surge of around 75 percent within this decade, most of it in sub-Saharan Africa. Africans will drive global population growth this century: Almost one in four people will live in sub-Saharan Africa by 2050, and by 2030, more than 40 percent of the world’s youth will be African — and they will need the energy, infrastructure, and income to live prosperously.

Meeting this challenge requires closing the energy access gap, bolstering resilience and security, and catalyzing economic opportunity. It is here that RMI’s Africa Energy Program is positioned to support by deploying truly transformational initiatives with our partners in the public, private, and philanthropic sectors.

Our vision

RMI’s aim is to improve energy efficiency, affordability, and reliability in sub-Sharan Africa — enabling 420 TWh of renewable energy, helping 390 million people access energy, and avoiding 250 million tons of CO2 emissions. Clean energy pathways can lift millions out of poverty, driving inclusive industrialization and economic growth. We further aim to scale solutions by unlocking climate finance and building local capacity, particularly for under-resourced sectors and localities.

Our vision is built across three strategic pillars that emphasize scalability, regional leadership, and resilience. They are:

Energy access

Our aim is to close the energy access gap and build affordable, resilient, reliable energy systems by scaling utility-enabled distributed energy resources (DERs) and advancing clean energy portfolios. RMI has been deeply involved in this work for many years, with the Africa Minigrids Program in partnership with UNDP and our constantly growing DER hub providing actionable, replicable proof points and templates for successful implementation.

Clean and resilient supply through innovative collaboration

We work to enable power sectors to shift toward clean, resilient, secure and reliable generation and efficiency, adapted to withstand climate and geopolitical shocks. While DERs, particularly distributed solar, have emerged as a crucial part of the solution, reaching universal energy access demands scalable and complementary approaches. Interconnected minigrids (IMGs) offer a compelling pathway forward, encouraging utilities and developers to work together, and our recent analysis of the first wave of IMGs in Nigeria shares key lessons learned and demonstrates the viability of this business model. Meanwhile, embedded generation can improve supply for customers in urban and peri-urban areas by injecting up to 20 MW of generation directly at the distribution level.

Green growth

As clean and affordable energy is made available, we support countries in putting that power to work. We partner with local communities, leaders, and entrepreneurs to leverage technology and attract investment that will drive industry and new economic sectors, create jobs, and establish a clean economy. Through emergent climate-tech solutions such as green ammonia fertilizer, green tower telecommunications, e-mobility, and energizing agriculture to spur productive use of energy, we’ve been able to support meaningful economic development and innovation by Africans, for Africa.

Our work rests upon these three pillars, which we hope to deepen and expand over the coming months and years as we look to scale our work across geographies in sub-Saharan Africa such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Zambia, Kenya, and South Africa. All of this takes place within the context of strong partnerships with local governments, utilities/distribution companies, project developers, and communities.

Workforce and finance as powerful market catalysts

All of these objectives are only achievable through the creation and cultivation of local capacity, and enabled by meaningful investment where it will make the most impact. Particularly in regions like Africa, with booming youth and labor needs, livelihoods depend on job availability and access. The clean energy industry is well positioned to not only absorb the supply of labor, but also power the industries to create a compounding effect and improve job supply.

RMI’s Global Women in Clean Energy program partners with local and global experts in Nigeria, Zambia, and Ethiopia to empower women fellows to lead the deployment of distributed energy resource projects, ensuring that women are not just participants but also leaders in shaping the future of clean energy. The program empowers women fellows to lead the deployment of distributed energy resource projects, ensuring that women are not just participants but also leaders in shaping the future of clean energy.

Meanwhile, challenges lie in chronic underinvestment at the critical early stages of project preparation, as financiers and investors struggle to find well-prepared, “bankable” projects that match their risk appetite and investment criteria. Prioritizing early-stage project finance and technical support can help turn global climate commitments and country ambitions into tangible outcomes and accelerate the delivery of climate finance goals.

RMI’s Catalytic Finance program helps derisk projects and deploy finance as an enabler of climate and energy solutions. We partner with the private and public sectors to increase absorptive capacity and mobilize capital to support investment in clean and resilient energy.

A time for action

Sub-Saharan Africa is at a pivotal moment — it must industrialize, and doing so requires expanded energy consumption and reliable energy supply.

Green industrialization offers a key opportunity for both clean energy abundance and economic development. Instead of a lower-value, unsustainable value chain dependent on fossil fuels, imports, and inferior legacy technologies​, Africa can boast a high-value, climate-positive, energy-agricultural-industrial value chain in and for the continent, taking advantage of the best emergent technologies in the world.​

Country leadership, partnership, and collaboration are the cornerstones of real impact. As global conversation centers on our energy future, COP30 has the opportunity to continue, deepen, and forge cooperation to ensure renewable electricity access for sustainable development and a low-cost, low-carbon, climate-resilient future.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture1.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 07:58:18.830385

3. Rivian was gross-profit positive for the second time this year

The company reported a small consolidated gross profit of $24 million in the quarter, a $416 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, and its second quarter of gross profit this year. It's not all sunshine and rainbows on this front, but it's making some progress that should be noted.

What's more, Rivian had $154 million in software and services gross profit, improving $167 million from a loss in the year-ago quarter. The $167 million in gross profit as a result of its joint venture with Volkswagen.

While it was a good quarter on this front, Rivian will likely experience more fluctuations in its gross profitability, and investors shouldn't expect it to be positive from here on out.

Making the best of a difficult situation

Shareholders should keep an eye on Rivian's vehicle sales in the next quarter as the impact of the eliminated tax credits could cause them to be lower. Things could turn around a bit once the company launches its R2 model in the first half of 2026. It will have a lower starting price of around $45,000, which could be a catalyst for the EV maker, but it's still a big unknown at this point.

Still, as a shareholder, I'm pleased with Rivian's latest quarter, and it appears to be managing a difficult time in the EV industry very well.

At the time, I gave a statement to the press that Louisiana gaining the ability to do its own permitting of carbon capture and storage projects was putting our state “on the verge of a new golden age” of energy production and all that comes with it — new jobs, more state revenue and a stronger economy.

With carbon capture and storage poised to take American energy dominance to new heights, we were years ahead of any other state.

As the Trump administration repealed many of the Biden-era tax credits, it doubled down on support for carbon capture and storage in the One Big Beautiful Bill because the technology is viable and has a market demand.

In the two years that followed Louisiana gaining primacy, industry announced $70 billion in new investment coming to our state, almost all with a carbon capture and storage component. Investments like this coming to fruition can create more of the job opportunities that will keep our kids here in Louisiana and improve lives across our state.

But as we’ve had the opportunity to use this existing technology to supercharge Louisiana’s economy past other Southern states, we have spent two legislative sessions debating whether to kneecap the biggest economic advantage Louisiana has had in our lifetime.

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it has awarded Texas with Class VI primacy, officially erasing Louisiana’s head start.

While we no longer have the lead, the game is not over. Companies are deciding, right now, whether it is better to do business in Louisiana or Texas.

That sent Rivian's stock soaring by more than 20% following the results.

But it's important to put the latest results into context. So let's look at three important takeaways from the third quarter and what they might mean for the electric vehicle (EV) company.

1. Revenue was higher than expected, thanks to tax credits

Automotive revenue jumped 47% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, with management saying the increase was driven in part by increased vehicle deliveries and a rise in average selling prices. That helped boost consolidated revenue by 78% to about $1.6 billion.

It's important for investors to know that part of the sales increase was also due to customers rushing to buy a vehicle before the EV tax credits expired at the end of September. The company's EVs were too expensive to directly qualify for them, but some customers were able to take advantage of leasing loopholes.

With the credits now expired, management said on the earnings call that it doesn't expect to have meaningful revenue from the sale of regulatory credits, ""and we've taken those out of our forecast."" The company also said that its deliveries of 13,201 in the quarter will be its highest quarter for the year.

In short, a rush by customers to get their hands on a new Rivian was partly fueled by credits, which helped boost deliveries and sales.

2. Tariff costs will be much lower

Tariffs have already caused a lot of turmoil in the auto industry, and their impact has had Rivian and its peers scrambling to find ways to lower costs. But a recent policy change from the Trump administration allows for vehicles built in the U.S. -- as Rivians are -- to receive a partial credit that helps offset some of the tariffs.

That's the technical way of saying that tariffs are going to be cheaper for the EV maker. Chief financial officer Claire McDonough said on the earnings call that the previous tariff impact on each vehicle in the third quarter was just under $2,000, but it will be reduced to just ""a few hundred dollars per unit"" for its new builds.

Tariffs of any amount aren't great for Rivian, but the new, lower costs are a big win for the company. It still has some vehicle inventory that doesn't qualify for credits, but management said once those are sold, its new vehicle builds in the fourth quarter will benefit from the tariff offsets.

3. Rivian was gross-profit positive for the second time this year

The company reported a small consolidated gross profit of $24 million in the quarter, a $416 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, and its second quarter of gross profit this year. It's not all sunshine and rainbows on this front, but it's making some progress that should be noted.

First, the company's automotive gross profit loss of $130 million was still a significant $249 million improvement from the year-ago quarter, thanks to increased average selling prices and cost reductions. What's more, Rivian had $154 million in software and services gross profit, improving $167 million from a loss in the year-ago quarter. The $167 million in gross profit as a result of its joint venture with Volkswagen.

While it was a good quarter on this front, Rivian will likely experience more fluctuations in its gross profitability, and investors shouldn't expect it to be positive from here on out.

The 70-year-old lawmaker said he had come to Belem, Brazil, to underline that Trump's aggressively pro-fossil-fuel policies do ""not represent the American people"" -- and that the United States is forfeiting a vast economic opportunity.

""Right now, we are deliberately losing our competition on solar, on wind, on battery storage, on electric vehicles and all the support technologies that go into that,"" he said in an interview.

""It is a huge self-administered blow that Trump is doing, entirely to pay back his fossil fuel donors.""

Whitehouse said that as he arrived in the Amazonian city in the early hours of the morning, he passed numerous Chinese electric vehicle dealerships -- a sight that hammered home his message about America falling behind.

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to the COP30 summit, leaving only a few prominent Democrats to attend in an unofficial capacity, including California Governor and presumed 2028 presidential-candidate Gavin Newsom.

""The Trump administration does not represent the American people on climate,"" said the Rhode Island senator, known for his long-running ""Time to Wake Up"" speeches on global warming in Congress.

""They are doing political work for the fossil fuel industry and the public very much supports climate action,"" he continued, citing a slew of polls to back his point.

For Whitehouse, one of the few remaining pathways to climate safety lies in carbon pricing, which he argued is essential to spark the innovation needed to slash emissions.

""If it's free to pollute, there's really no pathway to safety,"" he said, reiterating his support for Europe's carbon border tax -- a key point of contention with developing countries at COP30.

Trump, who received hundreds of millions of dollars from oil and gas giants during his presidential campaign, pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement for a second time on the day he returned to office.

Trump and Republican lawmakers have rolled back clean-energy tax credits and scrapped incentives for electric vehicles, prompting General Motors to scale back production.

Whitehouse's team said he will meet with ""heads of state, lawmakers, private sector leaders, environmental champions, and civil society leaders"" during his visit.

But he cannot take part in negotiations on the COP's outcome.

Attending the conference itself was made more complicated by resistance from the State Department, he said, which forced him to get his badge through a nonprofit organization.

""I've never seen the State Department be completely unwilling to support members of Congress traveling on an official Congressional Delegation, even to the point of refusing to help us get badges.""

The land swap, approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior last month, would open up a section of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.
All say the trade and planned road violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and other federal laws.
The lawsuit alleges that the land deal violates both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the federal Wilderness Act.
The land trade he approved would convey a little less than 500 acres of refuge land, most of it designated wilderness, to the Native-owned King Cove Corp.","Three tribal governments and several environmental groups sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to try to block a land trade that would allow a road to be built through a national wildlife refuge in southwestern Alaska.

The land swap, approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior last month, would open up a section of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Supporters argue that the road is needed to connect the community of King Cove, home to about 750 people, with a legacy military airstrip that can accommodate jets. That would give King Cove’s residents access to safer medical evacuations if needed. Opponents say the proposed road — to run 18.9 miles in total, most of that within what is currently refuge land — would damage world-class bird habitat that is in the heart of the refuge.

Wednesday’s challenges came in three lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Anchorage. All assert that the land trade and road development pose dire threats to migratory bird populations that use Izembek’s wetlands, including species with Endangered Species Act listings, and to the wider ecosystem. All say the trade and planned road violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and other federal laws.

The three lawsuits have their individual characteristics as well.

One of them, filed by tribal governments in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta villages, focuses on threats to traditional subsistence hunters who depend on the birds that use Izembek’s wetlands. The tribal plaintiffs are the Native Village of Paimiut, Native Village of Hooper Bay and Chevak Native Village.

“Izembek’s eelgrass wetlands are a lifeline for emperor geese, black brant and other birds that feed our families and connect us to Indigenous relatives across the Pacific,” Angutekaraq Estelle Thomson, traditional council president of the Native Village of Paimiut, said in a statement. “Trading away this globally important refuge for a commercial corridor devalues our lives and our children’s future. We are joining this lawsuit because defending Izembek is inseparable from defending our subsistence rights, our food security and our ability to remain Yup’ik on our own lands.”

The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental organization, is also a plaintiff in the case.

A second lawsuit, filed by Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, Wilderness Watch, the Alaska Wilderness League and the Sierra Club, puts a special focus on the process used to achieve the land swap and what it may mean for all wildlife refuges.

“Trading the ownership of refuge lands that Congress designated for conservation is a terrible precedent for the privatization of public lands. Building a road will have tremendous impacts on fish and wildlife habitat and could also greatly increase both disturbance and sport hunting pressure on vulnerable species,” Marilyn Sigman, president of Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, said in a statement.

The third complaint, filed by Defenders of Wildlife, puts a focus on the wider environmental impacts.

The planned road enabled by the land trade would “result in incalculable and irreversible damage” to myriad wildlife species, including marine and land mammals as well as migratory birds, that lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that the land deal violates both the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act and the federal Wilderness Act.

“Under the Trump administration, the Interior Secretary entered into an illegal deal done in the darkness of a government shutdown: a sellout of one of our country’s largest and most pristine wildlife refuges and wilderness areas,” Jane Davenport, a senior attorney in Defenders of Wildlife’s Biodiversity Law Center, said in a statement. “Our treasured public conservation lands belong to all Americans. Defenders of Wildlife will stand up in court to hold this administration to account for recklessly and unlawfully trading them away.”

The Izembek Lagoon area, where the road is planned, holds the largest single stand of eelgrass in the world and the largest bed of seagrass along the North American Pacific Coast, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The entire Pacific population of black brant, a type of goose, uses the refuge’s lagoon area, feeding on the eelgrass. The refuge and its eelgrass support several other bird and mammal species; about half the world’s emperor geese use the refuge as a migratory stopover, according to biologists.

A Department of the Interior spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on the lawsuits.

Last month, however, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum touted the land exchange and planned road as long overdue.

He spoke about the project during an event called “Alaska Day,” a gathering in Washington with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s three-member congressional delegation. The Izembek land exchange was one of the pro-development Alaska actions announced at the event.

“It just seems preposterous to me that somehow, it’s taken 40 years for us to put people first,” Burgum said at the event. “Because I know one thing as a governor of a state: You can actually do things like build 18 miles of gravel road and still take great care of wildlife.” Burgum was North Dakota’s governor before being appointed as Interior secretary.

The land trade he approved would convey a little less than 500 acres of refuge land, most of it designated wilderness, to the Native-owned King Cove Corp. The corporation would give 1,739 acres of its land to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be added to the refuge, and the federal government would also pay the corporation for the land.

The idea of a road linking King Cove to the World War II-era military runway at Cold Bay dates back decades. The legal and political battle over the proposal has also been long. Some of the plaintiffs in the new cases were plaintiffs in previous lawsuits over proposed land trades. The dispute was being considered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but that court in 2023 determined that the case was moot and dismissed it because the Biden administration was not pursuing the plan endorsed by the first Trump administration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f33c8d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+180/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2Fe6%2F7da1fdf04da89f9695838006f368%2F30306353975-aa8950998b-o-2048x1436.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 07:58:30.470367

Thanks to government incentives, homeowners can take advantage of tax credits and rebates when they make eco-friendly updates to their homes.

Unlike gas stoves, induction stoves do not release any harmful pollutants into your kitchen, improving your home's indoor air quality. Induction stoves are also more energy-efficient and cook faster than gas stoves, saving you time and money in the kitchen.

However, upgrading to an induction stove sooner rather than later can save you even more money. Federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act are expiring by the end of 2025. As a result, if you switch to an induction stove before the year ends, you can receive up to $840 off the cost of an induction range. To claim these government incentives, simply submit an IRS Form 5695 when filing your taxes.

If a kitchen renovation isn't in your budget or you rent, you can still add induction to your home and reap these benefits. Plug-in burners are an affordable solution that don't require any home renovation to install. Plus, plug-in burners are relatively cheap, starting at just $50, so they're also a great option for homeowners looking to try out induction before making the full switch.

By upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, like an induction stove, you not only reduce the total cost of your home's energy bills but also decrease your household's pollution output. This is a win-win for your wallet and the environment, saving you money while reducing your environmental impact.

TCD readers who have made the switch to induction ranges have shared their positive experiences.

Last week, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems”.
Developing countries have called for the impacts and opportunities of mining minerals for the energy transition to be included in the text.
Marengo said the draft reflected many of the priorities voiced by producing countries, communities on the frontline of mining projects and Indigenous peoples across developing countries.
More than half of energy transition mineral reserves are estimated to be located on or near Indigenous land.","For the first time in UN climate negotiations, countries attending COP30 in Belém, Brazil, are grappling with the implications of extracting minerals required to manufacture batteries, solar panels and wind turbines.

On Friday, a draft text on ensuring that the transition to clean energy systems is just and sustainable – a negotiation stream known as the Just Transition Work Programme – recognised “the social and environmental risks associated with scaling up supply chains for clean energy technologies, including risks arising from the extraction and processing of critical minerals”.

It also “recalled” the principles and recommendations of a UN expert panel, which called on governments and industry to put human rights at the core of the minerals value chain, from mining to recycling. The UN panel report, published last year, set out key principles to ensure that mineral supply chains benefit countries and local communities endowed with resources, create jobs, diversify economies and generate revenue for development.

“For the first time, minerals are on the main stage of COP negotiations – no longer a side show,” said Melissa Marengo, a senior policy officer at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI).

Demand for metals such as copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel and graphite that are vital for manufacturing clean energy transition technologies is soaring. But extracting them creates both new economic opportunities, as well as social and environmental risks for resource-rich countries.

Around the world, increased mining activity has fuelled environmental destruction, deforestation and conflict with communities.

Last week, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems”. Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of rare earths, which are used to manufacture permanent magnets for EV motors and wind turbines.

Developing countries have called for the impacts and opportunities of mining minerals for the energy transition to be included in the text. African countries, which hold more than 30% of the world’s critical mineral reserves, have been vocal on the issue. The African Group of Negotiators told COP30’s opening plenary that Africa’s resources “must translate into tangible benefits”.

“Water is worth more than lithium,” Indigenous Argentine community tells COP30

Earlier this week, the UK, backed by Australia and the European Union, proposed language on the importance of fair, transparent, traceable and environmentally sustainable mineral supply chains for the energy transition.

The whole draft text, which is described as an “informal note” and is meant as the basis for negotiations on the Just Transition Work Programme, is bracketed, meaning that none of it has yet been agreed by countries.

Yet, campaigners widely welcomed the inclusion of minerals in the document as “a real first step”.

Marengo said the draft reflected many of the priorities voiced by producing countries, communities on the frontline of mining projects and Indigenous peoples across developing countries.

“But the real test begins now,” she said. “Parties must hold the line to secure strong social and environmental safeguards, fair value creation, and a genuinely just approach to transition minerals” that focus “on prosperity for producing countries and communities, and not only on supply security,” she added.

The text notes that affected communities must be “central” to the design and implementation of climate measures and recognises the importance “of sustainable patterns of consumption and production”, including through circular economy approaches.

It also acknowledges “the importance of the rights of Indigenous Peoples” including self-determination and their right to free, prior and informed consent for development projects that affect them, in addition to “the specific rights and protections for Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact”, which cannot give their consent to mining on their land.

More than half of energy transition mineral reserves are estimated to be located on or near Indigenous land.

“We are making history, as no previous COP decision has ever recognised the rights of Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation and Initial Contact so clearly,” said ​​Bryan Bixcul, global coordinator of the Securing Indigenous Peoples’ Rights in the Green Economy (SIRGE) coalition. “Any attempt by countries to remove or weaken this text would represent a major setback for the fulfillment of those rights,” he said.

SIRGE has called for the text to go further still and establish exclusion or “no-go” mining zones on the land of uncontacted Indigenous groups.

COP30 could confront “glaring gap” in clean energy agenda: mining

Meanwhile, the inclusion of language on the “transition away from fossil fuels” remains deeply contentious, with references to fossil fuels only included as “options” in the text, meaning not everyone agrees to it being there. Saudi Arabia, large emerging economies such as India and China, and African countries opposed references to fossil fuels, according to observers present in the negotiating rooms.

To help deliver a just energy transition beyond COP30, the draft text includes a demand from an alliance of 134 developing countries – known as the G77 and China – to establish a mechanism that could act as a one-stop shop to provide countries with technical assistance and help foster international cooperation.

The idea has been resisted by developed countries, which argue that creating another institution would take a long time and risk duplicating the work of existing initiatives. Alternative options include “improving existing modalities”, “developing a policy tool box” and “developing guidance” to support countries deliver just transitions.

These alternatives amount to “tweaking”, Teresa Anderson of ActionAid International told reporters. “We know that if those modalities worked, we would not be in the crisis we are facing now.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/07/Broken-lithium--scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 06:57:27.512209

It's a big step forward for the nascent—and in some ways, promising—competitor to conventional lithium-ion batteries. But sodium-ion tech still has hurdles to overcome.

Experts say sodium-ion batteries have several advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries. They experience far less degradation over time, demonstrate superior performance even in extreme cold and can cost comparatively less when scaled.

But there are trade offs. The cells have lower energy density than lithium-ion ones, which makes them more suitable for energy storage systems or less demanding applications like low-cost EVs. And the technology just isn't as mature as lithium iron phosphate (LFP), the low-cost lithium-ion chemistry that's taking off globally for both stationary storage and EV applications.

Peak Energy claims its sodium-ion energy storage battery can operate without active cooling, unlike lithium-ion batteries, which require complex cooling systems and fire-suppressant additives for safety and performance.

Under its agreement with Texas-based energy provider Jupiter Power, Peak Energy will provide 4.75 gigawatt-hours of sodium-ion battery energy storage systems (ESS) for deployment between 2027 and 2030.

The company claims its grid-scale sodium-ion battery system can hold 3.1 megawatts hours of energy and operates at temperatures ranging from -40 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 to +55 degrees Celsius). That's enough energy to fully charge more than 40 EVs with an average pack size of about 75 kilowatt hours. The ESS has no moving parts, no fans and no cooling system pipes running between the cells, according to the company.

It has already deployed what it calls the world’s first grid-scale passively cooled sodium-ion battery at a site in Watkins, Colorado. As per the company, this battery can save more than $100 million in project costs over its lifetime.

Grid batteries, which look like large shipping containers, are becoming increasingly important for a few reasons. AI data centers, EVs and electric heating are expected to significantly boost demand for power in the coming years and decades. Renewable power generation is growing too, but it's intermittent. We need to store energy for times when the sun isn't shining or when the wind isn't blowing.

These stationary battery banks are different from EV batteries. They operate at controlled temperatures and are designed to repeat the same charge-discharge cycles, typically for over 20 years, which is a less demanding use case than that of EVs. EV batteries are exposed to different road conditions and varied climates and are subject to a wide range of charging cycles and mixed use cases.

Historically, grid-scale batteries in the U.S. have used nickel-based chemistries. But more recently, the market is pivoting to LFP cells. Sodium-ion’s entry to the ESS market could herald a new chapter if successfully deployed. But some experts remain skeptical.

“LFP batteries are currently the lowest-cost and most widely available option for energy storage,” Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technology and supply chain research at the research firm BloombergNEF, told me in an email.

As EV sales growth slows down in the U.S., more battery companies are pivoting to produce LFP batteries for ESS, including LG Energy Solution and Stellantis-backed NextStar Energy.

Plus, Peak Energy is not the only U.S. company that has tried to scale sodium-ion batteries in the country. California-based Natron Energy wanted to build a $1.4 billion sodium-ion battery gigafactory in North Carolina, but ceased operations this year due to funding issues, the Raleigh News and Observer reported. Another sodium-ion startup, Bedrock Materials, cited the dropping cost of lithium as a reason for why it closed up shop this year.

“Sodium-ion energy storage systems have the potential to compete with LFP in terms of energy density and performance, but they are a less mature technology and may not yet benefit from the same economies of scale as LFP,” Stoikou added.

It’s unclear where Peak Energy has sourced its sodium-ion batteries from or where they are manufactured. The company did not respond to InsideEVs’ request for comment by the time of publication.

Since their lower energy density could pose an issue for EVs, Stoikou expects sodium-ion batteries to play a larger role in ESS applications. But the road to wider deployment will be long. BNEF expects sodium-ion batteries to account for 5% of ESS capacity additions by 2035.

That’s not necessarily the case outside the U.S., however. China's CATL, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, revealed production-ready sodium-ion batteries for light-duty EVs and commercial trucks at this year’s Shanghai Auto Show. And electric scooters powered by sodium-ion batteries are already on sale in China, costing as low as $400.

Over in the U.S., whether sodium-ion battery tech remains a niche experiment or scales into a meaningful part of the country’s energy ecosystem remains to be seen.

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said the EPA has failed for months to release a report on PFNA, a type of PFAS contaminant. PFAS, often called “forever chemicals,” are man-made substances found in air, groundwater and drinking water across the country.

“There is no legitimate reason for this delay,” Pingree said.

“This isn’t just a few states,” she added. “Every state has these impacts.”

Pingree sent a letter last month to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding an update, but she said the agency has not responded. She argues the government shutdown is hardly a viable excuse.

In a statement, the EPA cited ongoing litigation as the reason for the delay and said “the Trump EPA is committed to addressing PFAS and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable.”

In May, the agency upheld Biden-era drinking water regulations on two PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, but said three others — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — remain under legal review.

Pingree said she worries the agency is bowing to industry pressure.

“We’re just worried that this follows a pattern of this administration being … bullied by the industry that, of course, doesn’t want to have to deal with this chemical,” she said.

Environmental advocates also accuse the EPA of ignoring clear scientific evidence. Kyla Bennett, a former EPA scientist who now works with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said PFAS exposure can cause developmental issues in children, obesity, cholesterol problems and thyroid disorders.

“My fear is that with these people running the agency, the American people are going to start to get sicker and sicker,” Bennett said. She described the environment for current EPA scientists as “hostile.”

Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who co-chairs the bipartisan PFAS Caucus, is also sounding the alarm. She accuses the EPA not only of delaying the PFNA report but of slowing PFAS cleanup work at military bases across the country.

Dingell joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers who sent a letter of concern to the Defense Department last month. She also plans to continue pressing the issue with Trump administration officials.

Energy stocks inched higher this week as oil futures climbed, while Enbridge rolled out a $1.4 billion upgrade to send more Canadian crude down to US refineries.

What does this mean?

The energy sector ended the week on a positive note, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund moving up 0.3%. Oil-focused funds led gains, as the United States Oil Fund rose 2.1%—mirroring a 1.9% pop in US West Texas Intermediate crude to $59.81 and a 1.6% rise in North Sea Brent at $64.00. Not every fuel joined the rally: the United States Natural Gas Fund shed 2.4% after natural gas futures slid 3.9% to $4.46. Meanwhile, pipeline giant Enbridge announced a $1.4 billion Mainline Optimization project to ramp up shipments of Canadian heavy oil to the US Midwest and Gulf Coast. While Enbridge shares dipped 0.8%, the plan points to strong demand for Canadian oil and steady investment in North American energy infrastructure.

Why should I care?

For markets: Oil’s gains put energy ETFs in the spotlight.

Climbing oil prices have pulled more attention to energy funds and oil-tracking ETFs, which often mirror moves in oil markets. That’s mostly been good news for investors leaning into oil-heavy indexes—though natural gas has dragged its feet. Concrete moves like Enbridge’s latest project could reinforce the sector’s outlook if oil prices hold up, especially with year-end in sight.

The bigger picture: Pipeline investments reinforce North American energy ties.

Enbridge’s hefty investment reflects a bet that US refineries will keep snapping up Canadian crude, even as climate goals gain ground elsewhere. Expanding pipeline capacity shows how firms are adjusting to global shifts in supply and demand, particularly with US oil production and exports near their peaks.

The $207 million headquarters will receive a $51 million subsidy from North Carolina economic investment funds approved this week, the Charlotte Business Journal reported. Local governments will contribute $20 million more.

That package helped win over the Volkswagen-owned startup, which is reviving the iconic Scout off-road brand as electric vehicles with a 2027 launch of its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV.

The company’s 150,000-square-foot HQ will anchor Commonwealth, at 1710 Commonwealth Drive, a 12-acre mixed-use project by Nuveen and Crosland Southeast.

CEO Scott Keogh told the outlet that Charlotte gives Scout the talent pipeline and quality-of-life pitch it needs as it rapidly scales. The company has committed to 1,200 jobs averaging $172,000 in total compensation as part of the incentives agreement.

Commonwealth’s mix of adaptive reuse, neighborhood-scale retail and modern workspace helped seal the deal, Keogh said. Plaza Midwood’s energy aligns with the brand’s outdoorsy ethos, he said.

Plaza Midwood, about 3 miles east of downtown Charlotte, was developed as a “streetcar suburb” in the early 1900s and has experienced explosive growth in recent years.

The headquarters move follows major progress on Scout’s $2 billion EV manufacturing plant rising across state lines in Blythewood, near Columbia, South Carolina.

That facility — incentivized with a $1.3 billion package in 2023 — will employ up to 4,000 workers and eventually produce 200,000 vehicles annually. Scout recently added a $300 million supplier hub there with no additional incentives. Having the HQ just 90 minutes up Interstate 77 tightens the loop between engineering, design and production.

Scout’s expansion plays into a growing Carolinas auto corridor. South Carolina has long been home to BMW and Mercedes-Benz plants, while North Carolina has finally broken through with Toyota’s multibillion-dollar EV battery campus in the Triad. VinFast’s $4 billion plant remains delayed, but Scout sees an upside long-term. Keogh said Scout is looking to create careers, not gigs.

QUOTES OF THE WEEK:

“We’re not going away, just like the climate crisis is not going away. Climate action leadership at the national level is not going to stop.”

— Representative Jared Huffman (CA-02) on the federal government’s absence at key climate negotiations during COP30 this week.

“The elimination of the GHGRP represents yet another example of the Trump Administration’s censorship of scientific data, while simultaneously threatening statutory obligations, jeopardizing taxpayers’ ability to claim certain energy tax credits, weakening American competitiveness in global markets, and depriving American businesses and investors of the credible data they rely on for decision-making.”

— House Democrats part of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in a letter to EPA Administrator Zeldin urging him to protect the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

“Using federal funds as leverage against communities based on political considerations represents a dangerous abuse of power that undermines public trust and puts lives at risk.”

— Illinois congressional delegates in a letter calling for the release of $3 billion in withheld federal funding to replace toxic lead pipes.

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT THE CLIMATE AND DEMOCRACY

STATE NEWS

UTAH REJECTS PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING: A Utah judge rejected an extremely gerrymandered proposed congressional districts map drawn by Republicans in the state Legislature and instead, put in place a fairer map. Judge Dianna Gibson ruled that the Legislature’s map violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018 that banned partisan gerrymandering and set neutral criteria for redistricting. This decision is an important win for democracy against partisan gerrymandering.

INDIANA SENATORS REJECT REDISTRICTING PUSH: Indiana senators announced today that they will not redraw the state’s congressional maps, despite pressure from the Trump administration and Republican Governor Mike Braun to do so. Our state league, Indiana Conservation Voters, led the fight against the redistricting push.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters Executive Director Megan Robertson said, “We are grateful that Senate leaders listened to Hoosiers and closed the door on mid-decade redistricting. Families across our state have been clear: they want leaders focused on the real challenges they’re facing every day, not partisan power plays.

“With this distraction behind us, we’re eager to get back to the work that truly matters: making life more affordable, healthier and more secure for families across Indiana.”

LCV ACTION FUND ENDORSES SHERROD BROWN FOR U.S. SENATE: LCV Action Fund announced its endorsement of former Senator Sherrod Brown for election to the U.S. Senate representing Ohio. Brown has played a key leadership role in passing clean energy and climate legislation, and will advocate for creating good-paying, family-sustaining, union clean energy jobs in Ohio and bringing down costs for families across the state.

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Vice President of Political Affairs Craig Auster said, “It is critical to have strong clean energy champions like Sherrod Brown in the Senate to protect people and the planet while Trump’s government shutdown and attacks on cheap, fast clean energy is continuing to raise utility costs for families across the country. Sherrod Brown has the experience and proven leadership Ohioans can count on — he will never stop fighting for a clean energy future that helps workers and working families, rebuilds the middle class and brings down costs for everyone.”

PENNSYLVANIA PULLS OUT OF REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE: Governor Josh Shapiro announced the Pennsylvania state budget, which includes exiting the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The decision is a significant setback that will result in a loss of over $1 billion in investments for clean energy that support lowering electricity prices.

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “The state budget Governor Shapiro announced today represents a devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy and pollution by walking away from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative without establishing an alternative approach. Pennsylvanians should not have to choose between critical social services and lower energy bills — and Governor Shapiro and legislative Democrats should have held the line and rejected that false choice. Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy.

“This decision is even more stunning as it comes a week after Democrats across the nation, including in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, achieved record electoral victories by promising to combat skyrocketing energy costs. Policies like an end to utility rate hikes in New Jersey and a commitment to rejoin RGGI in Virginia resonated powerfully with voters. Rather than using these victories as momentum for ongoing negotiations, Governor Shapiro surrendered our most powerful tool to lower energy costs.

“We appreciate that House Democrats successfully secured continued funding for the Solar for Schools program, a win environmental and labor groups have worked hard for over the last few years. Unfortunately, this win does not come close to providing the level or breadth of annual clean energy investments Pennsylvania would have secured from RGGI. Moving forward, Pennsylvania’s working families deserve a laser-like focus on implementing common sense solutions for a clean energy agenda that lowers their electric bills. As Governor Shapiro himself has said about the transition to clean energy, ‘Doing nothing is not an option.’”

The investments were formalised through 48 MoUs and GOs signed on November 13 and 14, underscoring the state’s rapid rise as India’s largest destination for green energy and green hydrogen projects.

On November 13, the state secured Rs2,94,787 crore worth of commitments, promising 69,800 jobs. The momentum surged the following day, with Rs 2,27,684 crore in investments and 1,97,439 jobs being finalised.

Of this, 27 MoUs signed in the presence of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and energy minister Ravi Kumar accounted for Rs 2,10,770 crore and 1,91,129 jobs, while GOs exchanged involved an additional Rs 16,914 crore and 6,310 jobs.

The minister said the projects span a diversified green energy portfolio, including large-scale wind–solar hybrid parks, green hydrogen and green ammonia units, biofuel refineries, tidal–solar desalination clusters, pumped hydro storage, battery energy storage systems (BESS), agri-voltaics and renewable energy manufacturing units.

Major investment commitments came from Ecoren, First Element, Essar Renewables, Hinduja, GMR, SAEL, AM Green and several global players.

Chief secretary K Vijayanand and NREDCAP vice-chairman and managing director M Kamalakar Babu witnessed the MoU exchange.

Speaking at a session chaired by Dr V K Saraswat, member, NITI Aayog, the chief secretary spoke of Andhra Pradesh’s commitment to building a Green Hydrogen Valley aligned with India’s Net Zero vision and the Swarna Andhra@2047 roadmap.

He stressed that green hydrogen will be central to decarbonising steel, fertilizers, refining and long-distance transport.

Vijayanand said AP’s long coastline, deep-draft ports and vast renewable potential—299.3 GW solar, 123.34 GW wind and 43.89 GW pumped hydro — make it uniquely positioned for large-scale hydrogen production and exports.

Under the Integrated Clean Energy (ICE) Policy 2024, the state is offering capital subsidies, SGST reimbursements, power duty exemptions and infrastructure support to establish 1.5 MMTPA green hydrogen capacity and 3–5 GW electrolyser manufacturing.

He noted that the proposed Green Hydrogen Valley – Amaravati includes a Rs 500 crore innovation fund for 50 start-ups, a dedicated skilling ecosystem for 6,000 professionals and a 25 GW green energy corridor to boost supply and exports.

SRM University will act as the nodal centre for research and training with support from NITI Aayog, MNRE, CSIR and leading industry players.

According to BRITE’s board chair Michael Stacey, “We are confident that under Jade’s guidance, BRITE will continue to accelerate the advanced energy economy and solidify the Midwest as a national leader in innovation.” Davis will have his work cut out for him as he succeeds Rick Stockburger who transformed the fledgling energy incubator into a respected national clean-energy enterprise that has supported more than 650 advanced energy companies, secured over a billion dollars in third-party investment and created over 2,100 jobs.

ORCHID: To the Grand Resort of Howland for earning this year’s Distinguished Golf Destination Award with exceptional status from BoardRoom magazine in partnership with Forbes Travel Guide. That merit-based designation recognizes exceptional golf courses throughout the nation that exceed expectations in the quality of service and amenities, facilities and the teamwork of the staff and management. The recognition comes on top of the expansive facility’s accolades this summer from U.S. News & World Report. That publication ranked the Grand Resort the No. 1 resort in Ohio. Given the tourist spot’s many luxurious amenities and a recent $1 million upgrade to the property, we look for such prestigious accolades to keep rolling on in.

ONION: To those irresponsible and reckless drivers who continue to operate vehicles while distracted by cellphone talking or texting as well as any other preoccupation that keeps their eyes and minds completely on the road. Such distractions can prove deadly, as indicated in the Ohio State Highway Patrol’s initial report on the crash that killed a Canfield trooper last month. According to the OSHP, Ohio has recorded 57,824 distracted driving crashes since 2020, of which 1,757 caused fatal or serious injuries. Such gross indiscretion also rises as a serious problem in the Mahoning Valley as the OSHP has made 2,268 citations for distracted driving here since the beginning of this year alone. Clearly the patrol and other law enforcement agencies have their work cut out for them, and we urge aggressive enforcement of the state’s tougher distracted driving laws that can result in fines up to $500, four points on your license and a 90-day driver’s license suspension.

ORCHID: To Champion High School English teacher James Sheldon for guiding his 11th- and 12th-grade English classes through a project of tangible and beneficial community service. His “Make A Difference” project has its roots in a lecture by a Carnegie-Mellon University professor on the importance of achieving dreams through helping others. This year, the students tackled such initiatives as collecting cereal donations for the Warren Family Mission, donating blankets, food and other items to the Animal Welfare League and mowing the lawns of elderly neighbors. In doing so, the students lived up to Sheldon’s lofty goal of truly making a positive difference in the lives of others.

ONION: To Newton Falls Village officials and council members who supported an original plan that could have thwarted a legitimate voter referendum on the use of unstaffed speed cameras in that community. The lawmaking body had planned to consider an ordinance last week to approve the immediate use of speed cameras that would have upstaged the citizen referendum approved for the 2026 ballot. Fortunately the proposed ordinance has been tabled. But given our longstanding opposition to the use of such cameras, we share the anger of 2nd Ward Councilman Brian Axiotis: “I was appalled that it was even on the agenda in the first place. These people went out of their way and got signatures so they had the ability to referendum this and vote on this themselves. … That strikes me as shady and terrible.”

But if all work together toward the common goal, then the Voltage Valley moniker the Mahoning Valley has earned over the past five years will remain fully charged for the long haul.","General Motors’ recent announcement of massive layoffs at Ultium Cells in Lordstown hit the Mahoning Valley like a ton of bricks.

For some, it rekindled a sense of perverse deja vu, harkening back to the series of GM layoffs that began about 10 years ago and ended in 2019 with the moth-balling of the once-sprawling 13,000-employee vehicle assembly plant in the village.

That’s understandable. The announcement two weeks ago that GM will permanently lay off 440 hourly workers and temporarily release an additional 850 workers at its local Ultium Cells plant beginning Jan. 5 stands as the largest set of job losses from one company in the Mahoning Valley in several years.

But, unlike the chain reaction of job shrinkage at the Lordstown assembly plant that began a decade ago, this time around, all is not necessarily doom and gloom for the road ahead.

While we are disheartened over this jolt to our ever-evolving Voltage Valley and saddened over its impact on affected workers, plenty of room for optimism exists toward a viable rebound.

But that rebound will not come easily or quickly enough for many. Such a recovery also will require cooperation and commitments from all stakeholders in the future viability of GM in particular and electric-vehicle commerce in general for our region.

As most know by now, the downsizing and temporary closing of Ultium stems from a massive decline in EV sales after this summer’s Big Beautiful Bill scrubbed $7,500 tax credits on new EV purchases and weakened mandated fuel-economy levels. With the loss of those incentives, EV sales have plummeted 74% from their 2025 peak, according to data from analytics platform Cloud Theory.

To reverse that trajectory, the automaker and its workforce, represented by Local 1112 of the United Auto Workers, face a daunting challenge. They must prove they can make their product line succeed without artificial stimuli via federal tax credits and other public-sector incentives.

Given the current political climate in Washington, hopes for any resurrection of such generous government-funded incentives appear slim to none. That’s why any upturn in electric vehicle production and the batteries that charge them must originate with the company itself and its able workforce.

So far, the signs of such progress are encouraging.

GM CEO Mary Barra has vowed to do everything possible to reverse the current EV sales slide. “We will continue to invest in new battery chemistries, form factors and architectural improvements to drive profitability,” she said in a letter to shareholders.

Part of that investment will feature major upgrades to Ultium’s plants here and in Tennessee during the down time early next year so that when the plants reopen next spring or summer, they will be primed to produce more efficient and less costly product lines.

As for batteries, GM plans to dump the Ultium Cells one-size-fits-all brand and replace it with a series of batteries tailor-made for specific vehicles. New state-of-the-art batteries, such as the lithium manganese-rich battery cells under development in Warren, Michigan, are designed to give EV drivers a faster charge and longer-distance range.

As for the company’s unionized workforce, cooperation — not contentiousness — must be the watchword to achieve mutually desired goals. That means all traces of antagonistic relationships between the union and the company must be placed in the rearview mirror.

At this early stage, signs of such cooperation look promising.

UAW Local 1112 President George Goranitis said the union is actively discussing with the company opportunities to attract new product lines to the sprawling 2.8 million-square-foot production facility in the Valley.

In addition to the company and its employees, others will have roles to play to accelerate any EV resurgence.

The state of Ohio and private companies should prioritize fast-tracking plans to blanket the state with conveniently located charging stations. After all, the fear of batteries conking out mid-trip fuel many would-be EV buyers’ apprehension of making the leap to clean-energy cars, trucks and SUVs.

Dealers could also play a role in jumpstarting EV sales by taking a page from the playbook of those that are offering discounts and rebates on EV purchases and leases to make them comparable or less than the cost of the gas-guzzling varieties.

Broader communitywide investment in the recovery of the EV market also could contribute to success. The Drive It Home campaign, a coalition of business, labor and elected leaders who came together to urge General Motors to reinvest in the GM Lordstown Cruze plant and later succeeded in landing Foxconn at the site, could be reactivated to advocate for continued investment here and to assist the company and its workforce toward that end.

Clearly the road ahead will be paved with struggles and potential setbacks. But if all work together toward the common goal, then the Voltage Valley moniker the Mahoning Valley has earned over the past five years will remain fully charged for the long haul.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.tribtoday.com/images/2016/10/11191558/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 00:58:13.969650

Video Series: Four short videos demonstrating: How ESA pesticide mitigations work.","CropLife America (CLA), the Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA), and the Council of Producers and Distributors of Agrotechnology (CPDA) have released new educational tools to help farmers, agricultural retailers, and pesticide applicators understand and comply with pesticide labels that contain Endangered Species Act (ESA) language.

The resource suite includes an introductory ESA 101 presentation and a series of short instructional videos that help explain how to determine if any runoff and spray drift requirements need to be met, as well as how to use the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) online compliance tools — Bulletins Live! Two and the Pesticide App for Label Mitigations (PALM).

“Our industry is committed to protecting endangered species and the ecosystems we all rely on,” said Alexandra Dunn, President and CEO of CLA. “By offering clear and practical resources for pesticide label compliance, we are showing our continued support for farmers and applicators. They need to have access to weed, pest, and disease control technologies for maintaining productivity, responsibly and sustainably.”

Federal agencies have long debated how to evaluate the impacts of pesticide use on endangered species under both the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the ESA, leading to EPA’s ESA Workplan. As EPA begins phasing in label language, CLA, ARA, and CPDA have joined together to support awareness and practical compliance across the pesticide supply chain.

“Understanding how ESA provisions will change pesticide label requirements is essential for retailers and applicators,” said Daren Coppock, President and CEO of ARA. “Working together, we can help ensure that everyone in the chain understands the changes and how to comply with them. We appreciate EPA’s efforts to provide clarity while maintaining flexibility and compliance with the law.”

The instructional videos are moderated by Dr. Stanley Culpepper, a leading weed science specialist with the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension, are designed to help provide field-ready guidance that supports pesticide use while protecting endangered species and their habitats.

“Growers are committed to doing things the right way, and that includes protecting endangered species,” said Terry Kippley, President and CEO of CPDA. “By using Drift Reduction Adjuvants and taking advantage of these new resources, farmers can meet ESA requirements with confidence while maintaining productivity in the field.”

The members emphasized the urgent need to restore energy assistance to millions of vulnerable households facing rising utility costs and extreme weather conditions nationwide.

“LIHEAP is more than just a utility assistance program, it is a lifeline for seniors, children, and low-income families,” said Congressman Ruiz. “In my district, families face some of the highest temperatures in the country. There is an urgent need to protect people from extreme cold or heat. Without immediate LIHEAP funds, many must choose between safety and basic needs. That’s unacceptable.”

“Families across the country are already stretched thin by rising costs, and now millions are wondering how they’ll keep the heat on as temperatures continue to drop,” said Congresswoman Trahan. “No one should have to choose between staying warm and putting food on the table. The administration must act with urgency to get LIHEAP funding out the door, so families aren’t left out in the cold this winter.”

The letter is currently cosigned by 101 Democratic Members of Congress. The full letter can be found here(link is external).

LIHEAP is a federal program that helps eligible households afford heating in the winter and cooling during dangerously high summer temperatures. In previous years, nearly seven million families, seniors, and at-risk households have benefited from the program. However, recent administrative actions have placed the program—and millions of Americans who depend on it at risk.

Earlier this year, the Administration’s FY26 Budget Request proposed eliminating LIHEAP entirely, while reports in April indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had dismissed all LIHEAP staff. These decisions have created confusion and delay, leaving it unclear who will approve state energy assistance plans or oversee disbursement of funds now that the Continuing Resolution has been enacted.

The lawmakers noted that LIHEAP is already an underfunded and oversubscribed program—reaching only about 17 percent of eligible households. Without swift action to release funds, millions of seniors and families could be left without critical energy assistance until early 2026.

Key Impacts of Delayed LIHEAP Funding:

Families face dangerous exposure to freezing winter temperatures and life-threatening summer heat.

Rising electricity and heating costs are straining household budgets, particularly in rural and low-income communities.

Administrative delays at HHS threaten to postpone LIHEAP disbursements by months.

“Providing reliable LIHEAP funding is not a political choice, it is a moral and public health imperative,” Ruiz concluded. “We must act now to protect the most vulnerable families before temperatures drop, and lives are put at risk.”

Indiana has emerged as a pioneering state in the quest to transform environmental liabilities into strategic resources through its ambitious Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction program. Governor Mike Braun's administration has established a comprehensive framework targeting the recovery of critical minerals from approximately 1,900 abandoned mining locations scattered across the state's coal belt.

The initiative centres on extracting rare earth elements from various types of coal mining byproducts, including coal gob (coarse mining refuse), processing slurry containing fine materials, and acidic mine drainage deposits. This strategic pivot aligns with federal encouragement from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Office of Surface Mining, which have explicitly positioned Indiana as a testing ground for domestic rare earth supply chain development.

The programme represents more than just mineral recovery; it embodies a paradigm shift where historical mining liabilities become potential assets in America's critical minerals energy security strategy. By targeting unconsolidated materials that contain trace concentrations of yttrium, rubidium, and other strategic elements, Indiana aims to demonstrate that coal-producing regions can contribute meaningfully to national security objectives.

Assessing the Scale of Available Coal Waste Resources

Indiana's coal waste inventory presents a substantial foundation for Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction efforts, though the true commercial potential remains under evaluation. The state's abandoned mine sites contain diverse materials accumulated over decades of coal production, including fine coal refuse, coal ash deposits, and various processing residues.

Regional Distribution Analysis:

• Southwestern Indiana: Concentrates the majority of historical coal operations and associated waste materials

• West-central regions: Contains significant coal ash deposits from power generation facilities

• Northwestern areas: Features processing slurry deposits from historical coal preparation plants

• Scattered sites: Distributed across 1,900 documented locations requiring individual assessment

The materials targeted for extraction include coal gob piles containing coarse refuse materials, fine coal processing slurry with potentially higher rare earth concentrations, and acidic mine drainage deposits where leaching processes may have concentrated certain elements. Each material type presents unique extraction challenges and opportunities based on its geochemical composition and physical characteristics.

Coal ash represents a particularly interesting component of Indiana's inventory, as power plant combustion can concentrate rare earth elements that were originally dispersed throughout coal seams. These deposits often contain measurable concentrations of light rare earth elements, though recovery methods remain largely experimental.

Commercial Viability Assessment: Grade Reality Check

The fundamental challenge facing Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction lies in the extremely low concentrations of target elements compared to traditional mining operations. Current assessments indicate approximately 10 grams of yttrium per cubic yard in typical coal waste materials, representing concentrations far below conventional commercial thresholds.

Grade Comparison Framework:

Source Type Typical Concentration Commercial Status Chinese Ion-Adsorption Clays 500-2,000 ppm REO Actively mined Hard-Rock Monazite 50,000+ ppm REO Primary REE source Indiana Coal Waste 100-300 ppm REO Pre-commercial Carbonatite Deposits 2,000-8,000 ppm REO Established operations

This grade differential represents a critical economic hurdle. While traditional ion-adsorption clay operations in China's southern provinces extract rare earth elements from deposits containing 500 to 2,000 parts per million total rare earth oxides, Indiana's coal waste typically registers between 100 and 300 ppm according to preliminary assessments.

The concentration gap becomes even more pronounced when compared to hard-rock rare earth operations like Mountain Pass in California, where monazite deposits contain 50,000 to 100,000 parts per million rare earth oxides. This means Indiana's coal waste contains roughly 1/500th the concentration of elements found in commercially viable hard-rock deposits.

Converting the reported 10 grams of yttrium per cubic yard to standard industry measurements yields approximately 13 parts per million, which falls dramatically short of the general industry benchmark of 1,000 ppm total rare earth oxides for standalone commercial viability.

Emerging Processing Technologies for Low-Grade Materials

Despite the grade challenges, several innovative processing methodologies show potential for extracting rare earth elements from Indiana's low-grade coal waste materials. These technologies focus on maximising recovery efficiency while minimising processing costs through novel approaches that align with sustainable mining practices.

Bioleaching Applications

Biological extraction methods utilise specialised bacteria to dissolve rare earth elements from complex coal matrices. This approach offers several advantages over traditional chemical processing:

• Environmental sustainability: Reduces reliance on harsh chemical reagents

• Selective extraction: Bacteria can target specific elements whilst leaving unwanted materials

• Lower energy requirements: Operates at ambient temperatures and pressures

• Scalability potential: Can process large volumes of low-grade feedstock

Research institutions are exploring bacteria species including Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans for their ability to mobilise rare earth elements from coal ash and processing residues. While still in pilot-stage development, bioleaching represents a potentially transformative approach for coal waste valorisation.

Ion-Exchange Recovery Systems

Ion-exchange technology offers another pathway for processing large volumes of low-grade coal waste materials. This methodology employs specialised resins to selectively capture and concentrate target elements:

• Selective separation: Resins can target specific rare earth elements

• Continuous processing: Allows for automated, high-throughput operations

• Minimal infrastructure: Requires less capital investment than conventional mining

• Regenerative capability: Resins can be reused multiple times

The technology builds upon established industrial processes used in water treatment and metal recovery operations. Specialised resins designed for rare earth applications show promise for concentrating elements from dilute solutions created by leaching coal waste materials.

Hybrid Chemical Processing

Integrated processing approaches combine multiple extraction techniques to enhance overall recovery rates whilst optimising costs. These hybrid systems can adapt to the specific mineral compositions found in different types of Indiana coal waste:

• Multi-stage processing: Combines acid leaching, ion-exchange, and precipitation

• Waste stream optimisation: Maximises utilisation of all process inputs

• Adaptive workflows: Can adjust to varying feedstock characteristics

• Cost efficiency: Reduces overall processing expenses through integration

Federal Support and National Security Alignment

Federal backing represents a critical component enabling Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative. The strategic alignment between state objectives and national security priorities creates funding mechanisms that could make otherwise uneconomic projects financially viable through industry innovation trends.

The U.S. Department of Energy and Office of Surface Mining have positioned Indiana as their preferred testing ground for domestic rare earth development technologies. This federal endorsement provides access to research funding, technical expertise, and regulatory support necessary for advancing extraction methodologies.

Key Federal Programmes Supporting the Initiative:

• Critical Materials Research Programmes: DOE funding for innovative extraction technologies

• Mine Reclamation Grants: Federal funding for environmental remediation with REE recovery components

• USGS Technical Support: Geological expertise and resource assessment capabilities

• National Defense Authorization: Strategic minerals research and development funding

The alignment addresses multiple policy objectives simultaneously: environmental remediation of abandoned mine sites, domestic critical minerals production, and reduced dependence on foreign rare earth suppliers. This multi-faceted approach enables funding streams that wouldn't support standalone mining operations.

Economic Model: Reclamation-Integrated Approach

Indiana's economic strategy cleverly repositions rare earth extraction as a secondary benefit of federally mandated environmental reclamation activities. Rather than pursuing traditional mining economics, the state treats REE recovery as value-added outcomes from necessary cleanup operations, incorporating mine reclamation innovations throughout the process.

Three-Tier Economic Structure:

Primary Objective: Environmental remediation of abandoned mine sites using federal reclamation funding

Secondary Benefit: Rare earth element recovery to offset cleanup costs and generate modest revenues

Tertiary Value: Technology development and export potential for other coal-producing regions

This approach circumvents traditional mining economics by leveraging environmental compliance requirements to subsidise extraction research and development. Federal reclamation grants effectively cover the base costs of site preparation, material handling, and initial processing infrastructure.

The model acknowledges that standalone REE extraction from Indiana's low-grade materials cannot compete with Chinese production costs or established hard-rock operations. However, when integrated with mandatory environmental cleanup activities, the combined value proposition becomes economically attractive.

Corporate and Research Institution Involvement

Several companies have established operations targeting coal waste rare earth extraction across the broader Appalachian and Midwest regions, with Indiana representing a significant expansion opportunity. These operations typically focus on processing capacities ranging from several hundred to several thousand metric tons annually.

The corporate landscape includes both established mining companies diversifying into coal waste processing and specialised startups developing novel extraction technologies. Companies are attracted to Indiana's initiative due to federal funding availability, regulatory support, and abundant feedstock materials.

Research Institution Partnerships:

• Indiana Geological and Water Survey: Leading state-level geological assessment and resource mapping

• Purdue University: Materials science and chemical engineering research support

• Indiana University: Geochemistry and environmental impact assessment studies

• Regional Collaborations: Multi-state geological surveys sharing data and methodologies

These partnerships leverage federal Department of Energy funding for three-year evaluation projects designed to demonstrate technical feasibility and economic potential. The collaborative approach pools expertise and resources whilst reducing individual institutional risks.

Global Context: International Coal Waste REE Programmes

Indiana's initiative operates within a broader international context of coal waste valorisation programmes, each addressing unique local conditions and strategic objectives. This global perspective provides valuable insights for feasibility study insights development.

International Comparison Framework:

Region Development Stage Key Advantages Primary Focus Indiana, USA Pilot/Early Commercial Federal funding support Integrated reclamation Appalachian Region Commercial operations Established supply chains Industrial-scale processing European Union Research-focused Advanced processing tech Environmental compliance Australia Exploration-stage High-grade coal waste Export potential

The Appalachian region has achieved more advanced commercial deployment, with several facilities processing coal waste at industrial scales. These operations provide valuable precedents for Indiana's programme whilst highlighting both opportunities and challenges in scaling extraction operations.

European Union coal waste programmes emphasise research and development of environmentally sustainable processing technologies, often with stronger regulatory frameworks and higher environmental standards. Australia's coal waste REE exploration benefits from higher-grade deposits but faces greater distances to processing facilities and export markets.

Environmental Benefits and Processing Considerations

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction offers significant environmental advantages beyond mineral recovery, addressing long-standing ecological and public health concerns associated with abandoned mine sites. The National Academies report emphasises the potential for transforming environmental liabilities into productive assets.

Primary Environmental Outcomes:

• Acid Mine Drainage Remediation: Processing neutralises acidic water contamination affecting local watersheds

• Land Reclamation: Converts abandoned industrial sites into productive or recreational land uses

• Waste Volume Reduction: Significantly reduces coal waste pile volumes through processing

• Groundwater Protection: Eliminates ongoing leaching from unmanaged waste deposits

Modern extraction techniques prioritise environmental sustainability through closed-loop water systems that prevent contamination of local water resources. Processing facilities employ selective chemical processes designed to minimise reagent consumption and waste generation.

The integration of rare earth extraction with environmental remediation creates positive feedback loops where mineral recovery helps fund more comprehensive cleanup activities than would be economically feasible through reclamation grants alone.

Processing Infrastructure Requirements

Successful implementation requires specialised processing infrastructure adapted to coal waste characteristics:

• Materials handling systems: Capable of processing heterogeneous coal waste feedstocks

• Chemical processing facilities: Equipped for selective rare earth extraction and purification

• Water treatment systems: Managing both process water and acid mine drainage

• Quality control laboratories: Ensuring product specifications meet industrial standards

Technical and Market Development Challenges

Despite promising technological developments and federal support, Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction faces substantial technical and market challenges that must be addressed for commercial success.

Primary Technical Hurdles

Low Concentration Economics represent the most significant obstacle to commercial viability. Processing enormous volumes of coal waste to achieve meaningful rare earth output creates transportation, handling, and processing cost challenges that compound with scale.

Current extraction technologies achieve limited recovery efficiency from coal waste matrices, often capturing less than 50% of available rare earth content. Improving recovery rates requires continued technology development and optimisation for specific coal waste compositions.

Processing Complexity stems from coal waste containing diverse mineral matrices that require specialised separation techniques. Unlike traditional rare earth ores with predictable mineralogy, coal waste presents variable compositions that complicate standardised processing approaches.

Quality control for end-product specifications remains challenging when processing heterogeneous feedstocks. Industrial customers require consistent rare earth purity levels and elemental ratios that are difficult to achieve from variable coal waste inputs.

Market Development Requirements

Supply Chain Integration represents a critical success factor requiring development of downstream processing capabilities. Indiana's initiative must establish connections to facilities capable of converting rare earth concentrates into finished products for electronics, renewable energy, and defence applications.

Logistics networks require establishment for consistent delivery schedules and quality specifications. Industrial customers need reliable supply chains with predictable pricing and delivery terms that coal waste operations must demonstrate over extended periods.

Market Positioning Challenges:

• Price competition: Must compete with established Chinese and other international suppliers

• Volume limitations: Cannot match scale of traditional mining operations

• Quality consistency: Must demonstrate reliable product specifications

• Customer development: Building relationships with downstream industrial users

Implementation Timeline and Success Metrics

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction programme follows a phased implementation approach designed to demonstrate technical feasibility whilst building toward commercial viability.

Short-Term Objectives (2025-2027)

The initial phase focuses on establishing pilot-scale operations at selected abandoned mine sites across Indiana's coal belt. These demonstration projects will test various extraction technologies under real-world conditions whilst generating data on processing costs and recovery rates.

Phase One Milestones:

• Site Selection: Identify 3-5 abandoned mine locations with optimal coal waste characteristics

• Technology Validation: Demonstrate bioleaching and ion-exchange methods at pilot scale

• Regulatory Approval: Secure necessary permits for processing operations

• Funding Security: Obtain federal grants for expanded reclamation-integrated projects

• Partnership Development: Establish relationships with downstream processing facilities

Federal funding represents a critical enabler for initial operations, with grants from the Department of Energy and Office of Surface Mining providing essential capital for pilot project development. These funding sources reduce private sector risk whilst demonstrating government commitment to domestic rare earth development.

Long-Term Vision (2028-2035)

The expansion phase envisions scaling successful pilot operations to process substantial volumes of coal waste whilst establishing Indiana as a regional centre for critical mineral processing.

Strategic Development Goals:

• Production Scaling: Process 10,000+ tons of coal waste annually across multiple facilities

• Economic Viability: Achieve cost-competitive rare earth element production through process optimisation

• Technology Transfer: Export proven extraction methodologies to other coal-producing states

• Regional Hub Development: Establish downstream processing capabilities for value-added products

Success depends on achieving cost reductions through technological improvements, scale economies, and continued integration with federally funded environmental remediation programmes. The long-term vision positions Indiana as a testing ground for technologies that could be replicated across coal-producing regions nationwide.

Investment Risk Assessment and Strategic Implications

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction presents a complex investment proposition requiring careful evaluation of technical, economic, and strategic risk factors.

High-Risk Factors

Unproven commercial economics represent the primary investment risk, as current extraction costs exceed potential revenues at prevailing rare earth prices. The integration with federal reclamation funding provides crucial subsidies, but long-term viability requires either significant cost reductions or sustained government support.

Technology development uncertainties create additional risk as bioleaching and specialised ion-exchange processes remain largely experimental for coal waste applications. Scaling laboratory successes to industrial operations often encounters unforeseen technical challenges and cost escalations.

Regulatory approval processes for coal waste processing operations involve multiple agencies and environmental impact assessments that could delay or prevent project implementation. Changing federal priorities or reduced funding for reclamation programmes could significantly impact project economics.

Strategic Investment Advantages

Domestic supply chain security benefits provide strategic value beyond traditional financial returns. Companies and government agencies increasingly prioritise domestic rare earth sources to reduce dependence on Chinese suppliers and enhance supply chain resilience.

The environmental value proposition offers additional investment rationale through environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria that many institutional investors prioritise. Projects that simultaneously address environmental remediation and critical mineral production align with sustainable investment themes.

Technology development potential creates intellectual property and export opportunities that could generate returns beyond initial rare earth production. Successful coal waste extraction technologies could be licensed to other regions or countries facing similar challenges.

Market Psychology and Investor Positioning

Early-stage positioning allows investors to participate in potential breakthrough technologies before commercial validation reduces investment risks and returns. The federal government backing provides credibility and reduces regulatory uncertainties that typically complicate early-stage resource projects.

Investment interest should focus on companies with strong technical teams, federal funding relationships, and realistic development timelines. Speculative claims about massive resource values should be evaluated sceptically against demonstrated extraction capabilities and processing costs.

The market psychology around domestic rare earth production often involves significant hype cycles that can create investment opportunities and risks. Successful investors will distinguish between genuine technological progress and promotional claims unsupported by economic fundamentals.

Industry Context and Future Outlook

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative operates within broader industry trends toward supply chain diversification and critical mineral security. The programme's success could establish replicable models for coal-producing regions nationwide whilst advancing American strategic mineral independence.

The innovation hub potential extends beyond immediate rare earth production to encompass research and development capabilities that could benefit multiple critical mineral sectors. Universities, national laboratories, and private companies collaborating in Indiana could generate technologies applicable to other domestic mineral resources.

Global competitive positioning remains challenging given China's integrated rare earth supply chains and cost advantages. However, Indiana's programme targets specific market segments where domestic sourcing provides strategic value despite higher costs, particularly for defence and critical infrastructure applications.

The integration of environmental remediation with mineral extraction represents an innovative business model that could influence policy and investment approaches in other resource sectors. Success in Indiana could encourage similar programmes for mining waste streams containing critical minerals.

Long-Term Strategic Implications

The transformation of environmental liabilities into strategic assets aligns with broader trends in sustainable resource development and circular economy principles. Indiana's initiative demonstrates how historical industrial activities can provide feedstock for future critical mineral needs.

Federal support for coal waste rare earth extraction reflects broader policy priorities emphasising domestic critical mineral production and supply chain resilience. Continued bipartisan support for these objectives provides a favourable policy environment for programme expansion.

Technology development in Indiana could position American companies as leaders in low-grade rare earth extraction, creating export opportunities and competitive advantages in global critical mineral markets. The expertise gained from coal waste processing could apply to other unconventional rare earth sources worldwide.

Indiana's coal waste rare earth extraction initiative represents a pragmatic approach to domestic critical mineral development that acknowledges economic realities whilst pursuing strategic objectives. While immediate commercial returns remain uncertain, the programme's alignment with federal priorities and environmental benefits creates a foundation for sustained development and potential breakthrough achievements in American rare earth production capabilities.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-15 04:01:13+00:00,Arizona Technology Council,Arizona tech leader warns repeal of energy standards could undermine economic growth,Not Available,,,,,https://www.aztechcouncil.org/news/zylstra-warns-against-repealing-clean-energy-rules/,"Arizona’s technology economy is thriving, powered by innovation, growth and a shared commitment to building a more resilient future.
It will inject uncertainty into Arizona’s energy future, weaken the competitive advantage that clean technology brings and ultimately drive higher costs.
Across the state, companies are investing in advanced manufacturing and clean technology facilities that depend on affordable, reliable and increasingly renewable power.

Energy efficiency can improve grid stability Expanding efficiency programs that reduce demand and improve grid stability is common sense, not partisanship.","Arizona’s technology economy is thriving, powered by innovation, growth and a shared commitment to building a more resilient future. However, this progress is now at risk.

The Arizona Corporation Commission’s ongoing effort to repeal the state’s Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST) and Energy Efficiency (EE) rules threatens to undo bipartisan, pro-business energy leadership that has strengthened Arizona’s economy and increased Arizona’s grid reliability.

The ACC’s stated goal is to cut costs and preserve reliability. Repealing these standards will do the opposite. It will inject uncertainty into Arizona’s energy future, weaken the competitive advantage that clean technology brings and ultimately drive higher costs.

Adopted in 2006, the REST rules established a clear framework for utilities to gradually increase the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. The EE rules adopted in 2010 require utilities to help customers reduce energy use and peak demand through rebates and technology upgrades.

Together, these policies have been among the most successful, pro-growth energy tools Arizona has implemented. They have attracted billions in private investment, created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and helped utilities avoid building expensive power plants, which translates into lower electric bills.

Across the state, companies are investing in advanced manufacturing and clean technology facilities that depend on affordable, reliable and increasingly renewable power. These investments have spurred job growth in both urban and rural communities, strengthened our supply chains and helped make Arizona one of the top states for clean energy manufacturing.

Energy efficiency remains the most cost-effective way to meet Arizona’s growing energy demand. According to The World Bank, for every dollar invested, consumers and businesses have seen nearly $4 in returns through lower utility bills and avoided infrastructure costs.

Energy efficiency can improve grid stability

Expanding efficiency programs that reduce demand and improve grid stability is common sense, not partisanship. Every megawatt saved through smarter energy use is a megawatt that doesn’t have to be generated, transmitted, or paid for by consumers.

Opponents of the REST and EE rules argue Arizona already has “met its goals” and utilities now voluntarily pursue clean energy targets, making the rules unnecessary. Voluntary goals can change overnight, however, and utilities may decide to walk back their clean energy commitments. Without a clear, consistent policy framework, there’s no guarantee that private investment in renewables and efficiency will continue at the pace our growing economy demands.

Some also claim the rules have “cost ratepayers billions.” That may have been true 15 years ago when early solar projects were expensive. But the point of policy is to drive progress, and it worked. Solar and wind prices have fallen by more than 80% since those early investments. Repealing the rules now would cut off the very progress that made clean energy affordable in the first place.

And while critics point to Arizona’s dust storms as proof that solar is unreliable, that’s exactly why we have a diversified energy mix. When gas or nuclear plants supplement renewables during peak demand, that’s not failure. That’s a well-designed system doing its job.

Repealing rules sends the wrong signal

The Arizona Technology Council represents more than 750 science and technology companies statewide, from innovative startups to Fortune 500 firms. Many support and depend on clean, renewable energy to power advanced manufacturing and data operations. These companies choose Arizona because our state has historically embraced an “all-of-the-above” approach: practical, balanced and forward-looking.

Repealing these rules would send the wrong signal to employers and investors at a time when other states are doubling down on clean technology and grid modernization. It would undercut Arizona’s leadership in industries like solar manufacturing, battery storage and high-tech construction, industries that bring quality jobs and long-term economic value.

The ACC should not pick winners and losers but provide stability, predictability and fairness. The REST and EE standards do exactly that.

If the ACC wants reform, let’s reform. But reform should mean modernizing standards and rules, not repealing them altogether. Let’s update the rules to reflect today’s technology and give utilities flexibility to meet them. Let’s continue to expand efficiency programs that save money and strengthen reliability. And let’s keep the policies that have made Arizona a national leader in energy innovation.

The Council urges the ACC to keep the REST and EE standards in place and build upon their proven success. Our future depends on it.

Jones publishes two papers on associations between intimate partner violence and non-communicable conditions

Brooke Jones, doctoral student in the Department of Maternal and Child Health, has published two papers in BMC Public Health and the Journal of Gender-Based Violence on associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) and certain non-communicable conditions.

“Associations between IPV and non-communicable diseases – a systematic review,” published in BMC Public Health, identified consistent associations between IPV and adverse outcomes across cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease, based on findings from 39 studies. Cancer emerged as the most frequently studied condition, with 19 publications, of which 14 focused specifically on breast or gynecological cancers. In contrast, research on the other non-communicable diseases was more limited, revealing an uneven distribution of scholarly attention and underscoring important gaps for future investigation. The research highlights a growing body of evidence linking IPV with worsened outcomes for individuals living with non-communicable diseases.

“Exploring attitudes towards intimate partner violence research and intervention among people with cystic fibrosis,” published in the Journal of Gender-Based Violence, explored perspectives on IPV-related research and clinical intervention among people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) and their family members. Fifty-four individuals completed the survey. While most (59.1%) find studying IPV in CF to be either ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ important, most (61.4%) had never been screened in outpatient health care settings, suggesting a critical gap in care. Key barriers to pwCF leaving abusive relationships included financial and insurance-related dependence as well as self-esteem concerns.",https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/112/2020/12/COMM_McGavran_Greenberg_738x491.png,N,,2025-11-15 11:06:17.109992

The Biden administration in 2024 had begun to study and seek public input on the need for additional environmental protections for certain lands on Alaska’s North Slope.

“By rescinding the 2024 rule, we are following the direction set by President Trump to unlock Alaska’s energy potential, create jobs for North Slope communities and strengthen American energy security,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “This action restores common-sense management and ensures responsible development benefits both Alaska and the nation.”

The action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to “modernize resource policy in Alaska,” according to the Interior Department. In October, the department announced actions that include reopening the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing and the completion of right-of-way permits for the Ambler Road project, which would provide access to an area rich in critical metals.

Other actions to increase Alaska energy production include a land exchange to facilitate the construction of a road between King Cove and the airport at Cold Bay which will convey approximately 490 acres within the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to King Cove Corporation in exchange for 1,739 acres to be added to another part of the refuge.

The game is at 9 p.m. Friday with the Tar Heels heavily favored. So that might affect the crowd that shows up at the Smith Center.

The Eagles, now in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, are 1-3 after opening the season with a 48-point blowout loss at N.C. State followed by closer defeats at Virginia and App State.

They are coached by LeVelle Moton, in his 17th season and a former star at his alma mater, who has been honored numerous times as a player and coach for Central. He grew up in a crime-infested neighborhood in Boston until his single mother moved him and an older brother to Raleigh and a safer place to live.

He was an all-conference and all-state high school star at Sanderson, averaging 23 points as a junior and just under 30 as a senior, putting up 51 points against Cary High School before signing with Central and becoming the university’s third all-time leading scorer with the nickname “poetry in motion.”

As an honorable mention All-American at Central, he was the 1996 CIAA Player of the Year and was inducted into the NCCU Hall of Fame in 2004 as the Eagles’ career leader in 3-point field goals (213). Moton has been mentioned over the years as a candidate for several bigger jobs but has remained in Durham with his wife Bridget and raised their two children. His Velle Cares Foundation has an annual event “Single Mother Salute” and celebrates more than 100 single mothers each year across the Triangle and gives out a Single Mother of the Year Award (named for his mother Hattie McDougald).

Moton holds a career coaching record of 278-219, including eight MEAC regular season and tournament championships. The last of those titles came in 2019 and 2020 before NIL and eventually revenue share began, which has made it even more difficult for mid-major schools.

The Eagles play in the 3,500-seat McDougald-McLendon Arena. It is named for long-time Durham civic leader Richard McDougald and former NCCU coach John McLendon, who in 1944 helped organize “The Secret Game” between what was then called North Carolina College and the Duke University Medical School, which was the first fully integrated college basketball game.

Central also has a rich athletic heritage in track & field under Olympic coach Leroy Walker. The Eagles football team was coached by former UNC All-ACC lineman Rod Broadway, who later had undefeated seasons at Grambling and North Carolina A&T.

Sam Jones, who won 10 NBA championships with the Celtics as one of the greatest shooters in the game, played at Central and returned there to coach for two seasons in the 1970s. As a five-time NBA all-star, his fame and presence made the Eagles games must-attend. The gym filled up an hour before tip-off, and the drum line didn’t stop until the game was over, win or lose.

Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps.

At a virtual meeting Thursday, EV companies, drivers and local government officials told the Maryland Department of Agriculture that the $150-per-port fee it will levy to pay for the cost of inspections could make it too expensive for companies or others to offer EV charging.

“This feels like such a sock in the gut to me,” said Lynn Parsons, an EV driver who testified at the hearing. “I hope I’m wrong. But for someone who has struggled to find EV charging stations, this just feels like it’s going to slow down the advancement of adding additional charging stations.”

But Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks defended the testing, which will be administered by the weights and measures division that already tests gas pumps, grocery store scales and other equipment around the state for accuracy. That division relies on fees to fund its operations, he said. And state oversight is something drivers are asking for, Atticks said.

“We heard from a number of owners and drivers of EVs about the need for not only registration, but inspection — and then inspection as a prompt for remediation,” he said.

Atticks said lawmakers gave his department the authority to levy inspection fees as part of the annual Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act this year. The department prepared the regulation, passed it to the legislature’s regulations committee and then opened a 30-day public comment period — that drew zero comments.

Some speakers at Thursday’s meeting said they felt blindsided by the news of the fees, which came in late September. They argued that the regulation was quietly ushered toward the finish line, and there wasn’t an effort to solicit robust comment from the public until Thursday’s meeting — after the regulation had already taken effect, and the department heard pushback.

Maryland joins suit against Trump administration on electric vehicles

Atticks said that the department did not directly notify any stakeholders, because the law doesn’t require it. The department followed its typical procedure for rule-making, he said.

The new policy requires that all EV chargers that offer a charge in exchange for payment be registered with the state by Jan. 1, and pay the $150 fee for each port at the station. Inspectors will begin visual checks in January, Atticks said, ensuring that chargers are registered (and affixing decals confirming that) and clearly display key information like the responsible party and the method of sale.

They’ll also tag and shut down any chargers that are inoperable, said Atticks, who recounted his own misadventures driving his state-owned electric vehicle around Maryland.

“There have been numerous examples that I have experienced where getting to a charger, the charger is not working and it is not easily possible — with the device or with the app that is associated with the device — to somehow prompt that it be refreshed,” he said. “I think over time, systems upgrade to allow that. Until we’re at that point, these inspections are going to be pretty critical.”

Sometime in the spring, he said the department hopes to begin testing the charging ports for accuracy, using a roughly $135,000 piece of equipment, known as a “standard,” that will check whether chargers are accurately tabulating the amount of electricity dispensed.

The cost of the standard is just one factor that went into the department’s decision to charge $150 per port, Atticks said. The fee also needs to cover the cost of electricity for each test session, which can take up to 30 minutes per port, garage or parking lot entry fees, travel costs and the potential need for return trips if chargers are in use.

In short, “it will take a lot” to inspect the chargers, Atticks said.

In an early October letter signed by industry heavyweights, including Tesla and Rivian, the companies asked that the fee be paused, and ultimately lowered to $25 per port. They also asked to limit the total fees levied at any one location. Their letter said other states have set fees at $20-$25 per device. Connecticut charges $50 per device, and Florida $100, but Maryland would still be top of the pack.

“Maryland’s new EV charging device registration fee — the highest in the nation — will discourage EV charging deployment, will impose additional expenses on Maryland businesses, and will further hinder the state from achieving its EV adoption commitments,” the letter reads.

But Atticks said not all those states have to fund their operations through fees, as Maryland does. And some states have realized they “underestimated the amount of time and expense that it would take to accurately inspect EV chargers, and so they are going back to adjust their fees,” he said.

Atticks also pushed back against speakers who compared the EV inspection fee to the $20 annual fee the department charges for gas pumps. That fee is not per pump but per meter, he said, and with each gas pump having between four and 10 meters, the actual cost is $80-$200 per gas pump.

The new fees will leave businesses that offer EV charging with three options, according to the EV companies’ letter: Try to eat the cost, pass the cost on to customers, or cut costs by decommissioning chargers.

The changes come as the state grapples with ambitious commitments to electric vehicles — and ambitious climate goals.

Maryland is one of several states that follow California’s emissions standards, which require an increasing share of car sales be EVs, until model year 2035, when all new cars would have to be zero-emission.

But Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order in April that allows the state to delay penalties for car manufacturers under the rule for model years 2027 and 2028. The EV charging companies point to that as evidence that the industry cannot afford additional stumbling blocks.

Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

“The State has acknowledged the market challenges facing ZEV [zero-emission vehicle] adoption; now is not the time to impose a new annual registration fee on EV chargers that is the highest such fee in the nation,” their letter said.

Parsons and others Thursday were particularly concerned that the same fee will be levied for all types of commercial chargers, whether they are DC fast chargers at highway rest stops or slower Level 2 chargers at isolated condo or apartment complexes, which typically generate considerably less revenue.

Robert Borkowski, owner of EV charging company Plug IO, which focuses on installing chargers at multi-unit dwellings, said in an interview that many charging ports at housing complexes may not break even financially, because of the new fees.

“We do not have enough EVs to offset that cost, because right now, we are still in a very early [stage] of building out the infrastructure,” said Borkowski, who also spoke at Thursday’s meeting. “There may be not enough EVs, just even to generate the revenue to cover $150 per year.”

Others ech0ed the cost concerns. Anthony Willingham, public policy manager for charging company Electrify America, argued that the new fee structure will make it harder for his company to find welcoming sites for chargers, such as gas stations.

“It just makes the idea and the product much less attractive, especially when the registration fee is much higher than it is — or then it would be — in other jurisdictions,” Willingham said.

He said his company began installing chargers in 2017, some of which are still operational today. They are faltering not because of neglect but because of high demand, said Willingham, who compared it to :putting your dishwasher in a commercial kitchen. It’s going to struggle.”

Baltimore Gas & Electric, which operates hundreds of chargers around the state, also complained during Thursday’s meeting. Utilities are already required to report to the state’s Public Service Commission on the reliability of their chargers, and are required to maintain 97% uptime, said BGE’s Stephanie Leach. Charger shutoffs by Agriculture Department inspectors could make the PSC’s uptime standard harder to reach, she said.

And, like the others, she also bemoaned the inspection cost.

“We have over 700 chargers in the ground —public chargers and then additional multifamily chargers. So we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars that will we will incur in registration fees this year,” said Leach, strategic programs manager at BGE.

Several speakers asked whether the department could cut inspection costs by inspecting less often, for example, or bypassing the expensive equipment and conducting visual inspections only.? But department staffers seemed resolute, and didn’t indicate that any changes would be made to their inspection plans.

Borkowski said he worries that condos and apartments with EV chargers that aren’t used very much will rip them out, to avoid the registration fee, or a fee for an inoperable charger. It would take a homeowners association or condo board that is “really pro EVs” to convince residents they should keep paying for costly charging stations because it’s “going to benefit you in the future,” he said.

Borkowski said he is already considering lowering the number of chargers in two upcoming projects at multi-unit complexes, because of the new fees.

Brian Booher, an EV specialist with the Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, agreed with Borkowski about the risk of charger shutdowns. He said the department should focus on fast-chargers being used by travelers in need of rapid power, rather than slower chargers used by building residents who are not necessarily in a rush to find a charge.

“The issues that we’ve encountered with reliability really apply and are most frustrating when we’re trying to find that fast charging — when we need power quick and it just doesn’t work,” Booher said. “The Level 2s around the county are really often there for convenience or you need them overnight.”

Atticks said concerns with multi-unit dwellings would be “one of our priorities to take back and just consider: What is the path forward?” But he also noted that other states don’t seem to differentiate between types of chargers in their programs.

“Now, look, this is new. We’re only, at best, a few years into any state regulating EV chargers,” Atticks said. “If we can be the ones to innovate and come up with the newest, best alternative, we’ll be happy to do that.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54486116423_04fa1b1fa3_o-1024x7681763175895.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=VTVt3OFY,N,,2025-11-15 00:58:23.870440

NEVI’s slow rollout occurred during the exact period when federal EV subsidies were propping up demand.
NEVI will ultimately deliver thousands of charging stations using taxpayer money to solve a problem Tesla already solved profitably.","President Biden promised a national network of 500,000 EV chargers would “sprout up very quickly.” Four years later, only 25 charging locations had opened, handing Donald Trump perfect campaign ammunition to mock the program as government waste. But beneath the political disaster lies an unexpected success story: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program forced America’s fragmented charging industry to adopt common standards that are finally making EV road trips reliable—and the program survived Trump’s inauguration day freeze attempt to become operational under his own administration.

The gap between Biden’s 2021 promise and 2025 reality gave Trump one of his most effective attack lines. At the Republican National Convention, he called the federal effort a “crazy electric Band-Aid” and claimed “They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didn’t work,” according to Politico Magazine’s deep dive into the program. The numbers were exaggerated—it was actually 15 stations at that point—but Trump had identified a genuine failure that resonated with voters frustrated by slow government action.

The Promise Versus The Reality

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg set expectations in 2021 when he predicted charging stations would appear “very quickly around the country.” Congress approved $5 billion for NEVI as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, with the primary goal of building a safety net of charging stations every 50 miles along major highways.

The execution proved far more complex than anyone anticipated. States struggled with Title 23 regulations—the 818-page rulebook governing federal transportation spending—while navigating Depression-era labor requirements and Biden-era Buy America mandates requiring 55% domestic content. The problem: hardly any American factories existed to produce EV chargers that could meet those standards.

Supply chain chaos compounded delays. Getting an electrical transformer for a charging station could take three years during the pandemic recovery. State departments of transportation, experts at building roads and bridges, found themselves managing technology projects involving software, payment systems, and grid connections—skills completely outside their expertise.

The Hidden Achievement No One Noticed

While NEVI failed to deliver visible charging stations, it succeeded at something more fundamental: forcing the chaotic charging industry to get its act together.

Before NEVI, America’s charging network was fragmented chaos. Companies like EV Institute in Maryland operated stations with 50-kilowatt speeds when modern EVs needed 150kW or more. Payment systems didn’t work across networks. Reliability was abysmal—Politico reporters visiting Maryland stations found multiple locations completely non-functional, with disconnected customer service numbers and graffiti-covered chargers displaying “OUT OF ORDER” signs.

NEVI’s 35,000-word guidance document established mandatory standards for reliability, interoperability, cybersecurity, and payment systems. To access billions in federal funding, charging providers had to meet these requirements. The program essentially told the industry: “You want government money? Here are the rules everyone must follow.”

The impact extended beyond NEVI-funded stations. States and utilities began adopting the federal standards as their own requirements. What started as conditions for federal funding became industry-wide best practices.

Tesla’s Network Opened Because Of NEVI Incentives

One of NEVI’s most significant but underappreciated achievements was helping push Tesla to open its Supercharger network to non-Tesla vehicles. The chance to tap NEVI funding was part of what spurred CEO Elon Musk to make the strategic shift, according to Politico’s reporting.

That decision transformed the competitive landscape. As EVXL documented in June 2025, Tesla’s Supercharger network dwarfs competitors like Electrify America, particularly along key routes. Tesla operates approximately 73,000 Supercharger stalls globally, and the network processed roughly 587,000 charging sessions per day during 2025.

The reliability gap remains stark. J.D. Power reported in May 2025 that public EV charger reliability hit 84% success rate—a notable improvement from 80% in 2021, but still highlighting the work remaining for non-Tesla networks.

Trump Tried To Kill It But Couldn’t

On inauguration day, Trump announced he would freeze NEVI along with numerous other Biden programs. But Democrats had written the program into law with such specific detail and embedded it so deeply into core federal highway spending that Trump found little room to maneuver.

The program not only survived a court challenge but was reluctantly adopted by the administration. While Trump relaxed some of the most burdensome requirements, the core mission of constructing a federal charging network endured, shielded by layers of Democratic legalisms and technicalities.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in summer 2025 that the administration would reopen funding, saying “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Duffy threw out Biden’s 35,000-word guidance document and replaced it with a brief 2,500-word version “to allow states to actually build EV chargers.” Gone were strict spacing requirements and detailed federal oversight. States gained flexibility to declare when their networks were finished.

Some EV advocates who typically opposed Trump policies found themselves praising the changes. The Electrification Coalition said it “appreciate[d] the Department’s efforts to streamline the program.”

Stations Finally Coming Online Under Trump’s Watch

With regulatory burdens reduced and states now experienced with the process, NEVI is hitting its stride. State transportation departments have wrapped their heads around charging infrastructure. Money is flowing and thousands of stations are under construction.

Analysts expect thousands of NEVI-funded chargers may be online by 2027 or 2028—exactly when the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation predicted back in 2022, though that timeline offered no political benefit to Biden.

Maryland officials say their first wave of 22 stations will be online by late 2026. Across the country, privately funded charging plazas are being built near highways without any federal assistance, suggesting NEVI’s standards have helped create conditions for market-driven expansion.

Andrew Dick of Electrify America told Politico that NEVI created “a level of consistency and cohesion that didn’t exist before,” noting that the federal rules became adopted as standard industry practice even beyond NEVI-funded projects.

EVXL’s Take

This story perfectly encapsulates the subsidy-dependent dysfunction we’ve been documenting across the EV industry. Biden’s NEVI program failed spectacularly at its visible mission—building charging stations—while succeeding at the invisible work of forcing industry standards. Then Trump killed it on principle but was forced to resurrect it because Democrats had made it legally unkillable.

The irony runs deep. Back in August 2024, we covered Trump’s wildly exaggerated claims about NEVI, noting his “$9 billion for 8 chargers” line was hyperbole but pointed to genuine failure. Now those same charging stations are being built under Trump’s relaxed rules, and he’ll likely take credit for “fixing” a program he tried to eliminate.

Here’s what nobody wants to admit: the charging infrastructure problem was always solvable through market forces if government would just get out of the way. Tesla proved this by building the world’s most reliable charging network without federal handouts. The company operates 73,000 Supercharger stalls globally that actually work, process 587,000 sessions daily, and recently opened real-time availability data to Google Maps for all EV drivers.

Meanwhile, NEVI spent four years navigating Title 23 regulations, Buy America requirements, and state bureaucracy to build 25 locations. The program’s real achievement—forcing reliability standards—could have been accomplished through simple federal mandates rather than a $5 billion spending program.

But let’s connect this to the broader collapse we’re witnessing. NEVI’s slow rollout occurred during the exact period when federal EV subsidies were propping up demand. Now that the $7,500 tax credit expired on September 30, 2025, we’re seeing the real market. As we reported last week, U.S. vehicle sales cratered in October with EV sales plunging 24% in a single month.

The timing matters. All those battery plants we documented sitting idle? The $28 billion Battery Belt collapse? That’s happening simultaneously with charging infrastructure finally coming online. We’re building the roads after the gold rush ended.

NEVI will ultimately deliver thousands of charging stations using taxpayer money to solve a problem Tesla already solved profitably. The program survived not because it was good policy, but because Democrats buried it so deep in federal spending that even a hostile administration couldn’t extract it without Congressional action. That’s not evidence of smart governance—it’s evidence of how hard it is to kill bad programs once they’re embedded in the bureaucracy.

The real lesson here isn’t about charging infrastructure. It’s about the dangers of building entire industries on government subsidies rather than actual consumer demand. When the subsidies end, demand collapses, and you’re left with empty battery plants and charging stations that finally work but serve a market that no longer exists at scale.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

Discussions at COP30 have reinforced Africa’s dual imperative: expand universal energy access while building resilient, low-carbon systems.","The first days of COP30 in Belém have underscored Africa’s urgent energy needs, with leaders emphasizing that closing the continent’s energy-access gap is critical for both development and climate resilience. More than 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa remain without electricity, while UNEP estimates suggest that developing nations will need more than $310 billion annually by 2035 to adapt to climate-related impacts. COP30 participants have stressed that achieving energy access requires not only pledges but substantial, targeted capital and robust partnerships.

Among the first signals from the summit, major multilateral development banks (MDBs) reaffirmed their commitment to accelerate and scale support for African countries through adaptation and resilience finance. While MDBs delivered a record $137 billion in climate finance last year, nearly 40% went to high-income countries and only about 30% to adaptation projects. Meanwhile, the African Development Bank has unveiled a suite of climate-finance tools to help nations transition to low-carbon economies and access large-scale funding, reflecting a growing emphasis on structured, bankable projects in Africa. These early actions highlight a central challenge: while adaptation, renewable energy and energy-access projects are critical, they often remain less attractive to private capital, slowing deployment where it is needed most.

Against this backdrop, COP30 has highlighted priorities for Africa’s energy investment, including decentralized renewable energy systems, storage-enabled solutions, resilient grid infrastructure and integration with local industrial and social development objectives. Early initiatives at the summit – particularly those linking energy access with smallholder agriculture and social protection – underscore the importance of projects that simultaneously address climate, energy and socioeconomic goals. At the “Africa Day” dialogue, ministers and development institutions emphasized the need to mobilize financing for renewable energy, infrastructure and climate-resilient solutions, while noting that many existing mechanisms remain insufficiently attractive to private investors, limiting project scale and impact. Notably, the launch of the Climate‑Resilient Social Protection and Smallholder Agriculture Finance Partnership, endorsed by 44 countries, highlighted the interconnected nature of climate action, energy access and poverty reduction. The implication for energy investment is clear: integrated models combining decentralized renewables, storage, agro-industrial linkages and local services are likely to deliver the greatest impact.

These insights from COP30 underscore the need for forums that translate priorities into actionable investment opportunities. The Invest in African Energy (IAE) Forum, scheduled for March 30-April 1, 2026 in Paris, provides such a platform, bridging the gap between ambition and execution. While COP30 highlights why Africa needs urgent investment – the scale of the challenge and the imperative for resilient, inclusive projects – the IAE Forum demonstrates how stakeholders can convert these insights into pipeline-ready opportunities. It brings together African governments, investors, development institutions and private sector actors to explore financing models, risk-mitigation structures and deal flow that support both energy access and climate objectives.

Discussions at COP30 have reinforced Africa’s dual imperative: expand universal energy access while building resilient, low-carbon systems.

,American Energy,2025-11-15 01:17:04+00:00,Jefferson Public Radio,Data centers are putting new strain on California's grid. A new report estimates the impacts,"Alejandro Lazo, www.ijpr.org, alejandro-lazo-calmatters",,,,,https://www.ijpr.org/environment-energy-and-transportation/2025-11-14/data-centers-are-putting-new-strain-on-californias-grid-a-new-report-estimates-the-impacts,"California is a major hub for data centers — the facilities that store and transmit much of the internet.
DataCenterMap, a commercial directory that tracks data centers worldwide, lists 321 sites across the state.
But the authors say their findings underscore the need for uniform reporting standards for data centers’ energy and water use.
The report said California should establish ongoing local monitoring and review of data centers — and make the findings public.
Ren, the UC Riverside researcher, said that California’s cleaner grid and stricter pollution rules are helping blunt some environmental impacts of data centers already.","California is a major hub for data centers — the facilities that store and transmit much of the internet. But just how much these power-hungry operations affect the state’s energy use, climate and public health remains an open question for researchers.

A new report released this week by the environmental think tank Next 10 and a UC Riverside researcher attempts to quantify that impact — but its authors say the report is only an estimate without harder data from the centers themselves.

“We are just making these reports pretty much in the dark — since there’s almost zero information,” said Shaolei Ren, an AI researcher at UC Riverside and co-author of the report. “We have extremely little information about data centers in California.”

Ren and his coauthors conclude that between 2019 and 2023, electricity use and carbon emissions by California data centers nearly doubled, while on-site water consumption slightly more than doubled. Much of the increases were attributable to the electricity required to run artificial intelligence computations. But many of the report’s estimates, including its health impacts, are based on limited data — a key issue researchers said they encountered repeatedly when crafting the report.

The report underscores a growing tension in the industry: advocates who support clean energy and experts who study energy demand agree the days of steady, flat energy use at data centers are over, but there’s far less consensus on just how sharply electricity demand will climb.

“In very simple terms, a lot of the uncertainty comes from: what is our life going to look like with AI in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years — how integrated is it going to become?” said Maia Leroy, a Sacramento-based advocate who focuses on clean energy and the grid. “Are we reaching a point where the use is going to plateau, or is it going to continue?”

Experts say more transparency is essential to better understand what resources data centers demand in California.

Liang Min, who manages the Bits and Watts Initiative at Stanford University, says the state should improve its forecasts for energy demand to support clean energy goals. Min, who investigates AI’s growing strain on the electric grid, told CalMatters that demand at power centers rises in rapid, unpredictable phases and can shift quickly with each new generation of hardware.

The California Energy Commission, which plans for energy use and the growth in demand, “can play a pivotal role,” in understanding and adapting to the demands of AI.

As demand grows, policy responses lag

In Sacramento, efforts to add transparency and guardrails around data centers have struggled this year. California lawmakers shelved most consumer and environmental proposals aimed at data centers, even as they approved a plan to regionalize California’s power grid to help meet demand from the sector. They set aside two bills focused on curbing data centers’ energy use — one requiring operators to disclose their electricity use and another that offered clean power incentives.

Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a separate proposal that would have required data center operators to report their water use, even after the bill was weakened. In the end, Newsom — who has often highlighted California’s dominance in the artificial intelligence sector — signed only one measure, allowing regulators to determine whether data centers are driving up costs.

Mark Toney, who leads The Utility Reform Network and supported the transparency measure, has questioned whether data centers justify the costs they’re pushing onto ratepayers.

He warned of the centers’ “voracious consumption of energy and water, increased carbon emissions, and jacking up ratepayer bills.”

Hard facts about data centers are tough to find in California because most rent out power, cooling and floor space to other companies, said Ren, the UC Riverside researcher. Such colocation facilities don’t run their own servers or technology, so they report less information publicly than data centers built by major tech companies in other states.

While estimates vary, California has the third-most data centers in the country, after Texas and Virginia. DataCenterMap, a commercial directory that tracks data centers worldwide, lists 321 sites across the state. More in California are expected in coming years.

The centers operate around the clock and often rely on diesel backup generators to maintain service during power failures — a practice that adds both greenhouse gases and local air pollutants. They also consume energy and water depending on their cooling methods.

Rising data-center demand, and rising questions

F. Noel Perry, the businessman and philanthropist who founded Next 10, said his organization’s report shines light on what is fundamentally a black box. “To solve a problem, we have to understand what the problem is,” he said.

“We’ve seen the proliferation of data centers in California, in the U.S. and across the world — and we also are seeing major implications for the environment,” Perry told CalMatters. “The real issue has to do with transparency — and the ability of elected officials and regulators to create some rules that will govern reductions in emissions, water consumption.”

The report estimated that data centers used 10.8 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023, up from 5.5 terawatt-hours in 2019, accounting for 6% of the nation’s total data center energy use. Unless growth is curbed or better managed, the report’s authors project demand could rise to as high as 25 terawatt-hours by 2028, equal to the power use of roughly 2.4 million U.S. homes.

Carbon emissions from the sector nearly doubled during the same period, climbing from 1.2 million to 2.4 million tons, researchers estimated, while on site water use grew from 1,078 acre feet in 2019 to 2,302 acre feet in 2023. That’s enough to meet the annual water needs of almost seven thousand California households.

The report’s authors also estimated the public health costs from air pollution associated with data centers have potentially risen, from $45 million in 2019 to more than $155 million in 2023, with the burden expected to reach as high as $266 million by 2028.

Most of those costs stem from indirect pollution produced by fossil-fueled power plants that supply the grid. But authors pointed out that regions dense with data centers — particularly Santa Clara County, home to Silicon Valley — could face higher localized risks from diesel backup generators.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, said the report exaggerates the impact of backup diesel generators, which are tightly regulated and rarely used in California, minimizing their contributions to air pollution. Data centers don’t control the water used in electricity generation, said Diorio. Since those water impacts don’t happen on site, it’s not fair to blame that on the centers themselves.

“It paints a skewed picture of this critical 21st-century industry,” Diorio said in a statement.

Diorio said the report also overlooks how cooling technology varies by region and has become more efficient in recent years.

But the authors say their findings underscore the need for uniform reporting standards for data centers’ energy and water use. The report said California should establish ongoing local monitoring and review of data centers — and make the findings public.

The announcement came Friday during a community event in Midlothian attended by federal, state and local leaders. The investment — Google’s largest in any state — includes a new data center campus in Armstrong County, two in Haskell County, and continued buildout of the company’s Ellis County facilities and Dallas cloud region.

“This is a Texas-sized investment in the future of our great state,” Gov. Greg Abbott said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Texas has become a key location for next-generation computing. “Texas offers the right combination of energy, workforce and innovation,” Pichai said. “This investment will bring new data center campuses online, support thousands of jobs and help power the next era of AI development.”

Rural counties shift into the tech spotlight

The Panhandle and West Texas campuses bring major technology investment to rural areas traditionally known for agriculture and energy. Local leaders said the projects will diversify their economies and provide long-term jobs.

Armstrong County Judge Adam Ensey called Google’s investment “a generational opportunity” that places the region at the edge of the global digital economy. Haskell County Judge Kenny Thompson said the new campuses will strengthen infrastructure and create “top-tier employment opportunities” for residents.

Google is joining a growing cluster of high-density computing projects in the region.

Armstrong County commissioners recently approved an amendment to Crusoe Energy’s tax abatement agreement for a 3.5 million-square-foot AI data center complex south of Claude. Four buildings are currently under construction off Lima Road east of Highway 207 and could be completed within two years, according to company spokesman Tyler Hunt. Under the revised abatement, the county will receive $1.35 million per building per year, once each becomes operational, which could produce earlier revenue for the county beginning in 2026. Hunt said at the time that the company was negotiating with a tenant but did not yet have a final commitment.

Judge Ensey said the Crusoe structure benefits the county by tying payments to individual buildings as they come online rather than waiting for multiple phases to be completed. He also noted Armstrong County officials are tracking other regional developments, including Fermi America’s proposed 18 million-square-foot AI data center and energy campus in neighboring Carson County.

Part of a statewide data center boom

Texas has seen rapid growth in hyperscale data centers as companies seek land, renewable energy and access to the ERCOT grid. Google recently opened the first building at its Red Oak campus in Ellis County and continues expanding its Midlothian site and Dallas cloud region — part of the company’s global network of 42 cloud regions.

Deputy Secretary of Energy James Danly said the projects reflect the United States’ effort to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence. “This investment strengthens America’s AI competitiveness while helping keep energy reliable and affordable,” Danly said.

Energy planners say the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure is expected to increase statewide power demand, prompting closer coordination between developers and ERCOT.

State leaders, including Sen. John Cornyn, said the expansion will support national competitiveness in AI and cybersecurity.

Energy plans shaped around high-power AI needs

Google outlined several energy commitments to support the electricity demands of AI computing:

More than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power purchase agreements with developers including AES, Enel, Clearway and Ørsted.

A co-located solar and battery storage project at one of the Haskell County campuses, developed with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate, designed to align on-site clean energy with heavy compute loads.

A $30 million Energy Impact Fund, beginning in 2026, to support local weatherization, energy efficiency upgrades and workforce development.

Company officials said pairing energy supply with data center load can reduce transmission strain and improve long-term grid planning.

Water and environmental commitments

Google said its new Texas campuses will use advanced air-cooling systems that significantly reduce water use, limiting consumption to non-computing needs such as kitchens and employee facilities.

The company also announced:

$2.6 million to Texas Water Trade to restore up to 1,000 acres of wetlands in the Trinity–San Jacinto Estuary, delivering about 300 million gallons of freshwater annually.

More than $2 million for agricultural programs, including regenerative farming efforts in North Texas and irrigation-efficiency projects in the High Plains.

Preparing Texas workers for AI-era jobs

To meet rising demand for electricians and data center technicians, Google partnered with the electrical training ALLIANCE to train more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, supported by Google.org’s AI Opportunity Fund.

The company also committed $7 million for AI-related initiatives in healthcare, energy and education. Funding includes support for rural health outreach through CareMessage, energy research at the University of Texas and Texas Tech University, and AI-skills programs at Houston Community College.

Colleges across the state — including UT, Texas A&M, Texas State, Dallas College and South Texas College — are part of Google’s AI for Education Accelerator, which provides free AI training and career certificates to students and faculty.

Texas’ digital landscape continues to shift

Local officials said Google’s expansion — combined with active construction by Crusoe Energy in Armstrong County and the proposed Fermi America project in Carson County — reflects how the Panhandle and West Texas are becoming a significant cluster for AI and cloud-computing infrastructure.

Midlothian Mayor Justin Coffman said Google’s presence has already shaped local economic development. “Their presence is a catalyst for long-term growth,” Coffman said.

“Our region has long powered America through agriculture and energy,” Ensey said. “Now it will help power the future of innovation.”","https://www.amarillo.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/14/NAGN/87279018007-47-a-1634.jpg?crop=7624,4289,x0,y398&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-14 21:04:52.251062

Fortunately, as coal plants have shuttered, researchers have noted a decrease in associated mortality rates, meaning these deaths can be prevented.
Beyond the health burdens, economic costs and legal concerns around the order, Campbell is also inefficient.","Joining a slew of retired coal power plants in the state, the JH Campbell Generating Plant’s planned closure in West Olive was meant to signal the beginning of a new era — one where our energy needs can be met by cleaner, more sustainable means.

But just a week before Campbell was supposed to power down, the US Department of Energy issued an emergency order on May 23 to Consumers Energy to keep the plant online. With another extension on the horizon, it’s unclear how long the Campbell plant will be caught in limbo.

As long as Campbell and other coal-fired power plants keep polluting the air, Michiganders will continue to suffer immediate and long-term health consequences.

Most coverage has focused on the financial cost to ratepayers — including more than $80 million Consumers spent to keep Campbell running from May to September. But the human toll of coal is beyond economic comprehension, contributing to overburdened health care systems, sick children, and preventable, premature deaths.

Representing more than 400 Michigan health professionals, we at the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action (MiCCA) know from a vast body of literature that coal-burning power plants are a major source of fine particulate matter air pollution.

Airborne particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter — known as PM2.5 — are imperceptible to the human eye. The smaller the particles, the greater the health risk, as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. PM2.5 exposure is linked to a myriad of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues.

Many industrial activities emit PM2.5, including vehicle tailpipe emissions and the combustion of oil and natural gas. These sources are a significant concern for clinicians in our network, but coal pollution is especially harmful to public health.

In a 2023 study published in Science, researchers found that PM2.5 from coal was associated with a 2.1-times greater risk of death than other sources of air pollution. Using emissions and Medicare data, the study’s authors also found that 460,000 deaths in the US were attributable to coal-related PM2.5 from 1999 to 2020.

And PM2.5 isn’t the only pollutant associated with coal power plants. Nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and heavy metals like mercury, lead and arsenic are all linked to coal-fired generation.

Robust data shows that people living near coal power plants face higher rates of hospitalization, chronic lung disease, and premature deaths. Pregnant women are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight, and research suggests that exposure to coal ash can harm children’s cognitive development.

Fortunately, as coal plants have shuttered, researchers have noted a decrease in associated mortality rates, meaning these deaths can be prevented. Trips to the emergency department and hospitalizations for lung-related causes have dropped, too.

The misguided order to keep Campbell operational also comes amid a number of proposed federal rollbacks that would weaken regulations on several public health measures, including the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which limit emissions of hazardous pollutants from power plants.

Beyond the health burdens, economic costs and legal concerns around the order, Campbell is also inefficient. In legal filings challenging the order, environmental groups detailed how even during the summer’s highest demand day, the regional grid operator had a surplus of energy.

Actions that rescind environmental protections and force the continued operation of dirty coal are shortsighted and threaten to reverse decades of public health progress.

As health professionals, we cannot understate the importance of having affordable and reliable energy. But there is no evidence-based justification for prolonging a technology that is no longer necessary to meet our energy needs and causes undue harm to our most vulnerable communities.

We hope Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel will continue to fight this irrational order, and we call on the US Department of Energy to end this political theater and leave coal in the 20th century, where it belongs.

Saudi Aramco is shaking up the global gas market, locking in long-term US LNG supply agreements and a multibillion-dollar stake in a Louisiana project as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince heads to Washington.

What does this mean?

Long dominant in oil, Saudi Aramco is now pivoting heavily into liquefied natural gas. The company is set to acquire a stake in Woodside Energy’s $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG facility, securing up to 2 million tons of LNG annually. It’s also in talks for another 2 million tons each year from Commonwealth LNG’s proposed Cameron, Louisiana plant. With these deals, Aramco aims to multiply its global LNG footprint from 4.5 million tons currently under development to a target of 20 million tons per year. While none of the companies have issued official statements, this aggressive push reflects rising LNG demand worldwide—especially in Asia and Europe—as buyers look for stable supply and US exports become more dominant.

Why should I care?

For markets: The US steps into the LNG driver’s seat.

With the US on course to claim the global top spot for LNG exports, these massive deals put Louisiana center stage for the industry’s expansion. The billions flowing into Woodside’s project alone show strong conviction in higher long-term demand, while major players jockey for a secure foothold in the evolving LNG landscape. Investors will be watching how these moves influence LNG prices, trade patterns, and corporate strategies as the sector heats up.

PHILADELPHIA - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today announced the award of a grant of $45,000 to the Baltimore Development Corporation under the Smart Growth: Saving Open Space, Revitalizing Brownfields program. The grant will support the establishment of “Smart Sites,” a program to market brownfield sites to potential developers.

Brownfields are abandoned industrial and commercial properties where contamination has been a barrier to expansion or redevelopment.

“Smart Sites will make things easier for those interested in developing a brownfields site in Baltimore by streamlining permit and approval procedures, and identifying a single point of contact within government to assist the developer,” said Donald S. Welsh, administrator for EPA’s mid-Atlantic region.

.

Through “Smart Sites,” state and city governments will promote sites that have been identified as development priorities. The program will target sites most likely to create smart growth projects, considering the potential for a mix of uses and proximity to public transit.

Promotion of brownfields development encourages land recycling, while reducing development pressure on greenfield sites. This helps protect air and water quality by reducing the amount of vehicle miles traveled and the amount of land paved over by greenfield development. The “Smart Sites” approach, which includes a website to publicize financial incentives for developing brownfields, will also serve as a model for other communities of how to inventory, manage, and promote the reuse of brownfield sites.

EPA’s “Smart Growth: Saving Open Space, Revitalizing Brownfields” grant program is an important component of EPA Administrator Whitman’s “Open Space Preservation Strategies for Promoting Smarter Growth and Environmental Preservation” initiative. Announced Jan. 24, 2002, this initiative recognizes the critical importance of linking open space preservation and Brownfield redevelopment through a smart growth approach to achieve better environmental protection. In addition to the grants, the initiative provides technical assistance to states and communities to prioritize open space for preservation.

Government of Canada, ""Budget 2025: Canada Strong"", (November 4, 2025) [Budget 2025].
Budget 2025, p 347.
Budget 2025, p 351.
Budget 2025, p 349.","On November 4, 2025 (""Budget Day 25"") the Federal Government tabled Budget 2025.1 As part of Budget 2025, the Government introduced several tax measures, including proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the ""Tax Act""), aimed at maintaining Canada's role as a global leader in the critical minerals space and continuing its journey to a net-zero economy. These measures are summarized below.

Extension of Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

Budget 2025 confirms the Government's intention, originally announced on March 3, 2025, to extend availability of the 15% mineral exploration tax credit (the ""METC"") available to subscribers of flow-through shares in resource issuers undertaking certain grassroots exploration activities.2 Under the current legislation, the METC would not apply to flow-through share agreements entered into after March 31, 2025, so confirmation that the Government intends to proceed with the extension, as previously announced, is welcome.

Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (""CMETC"") is a 30% tax credit available to investors who subscribe for flow-through shares in mining companies that explore for certain critical minerals. The list of eligible critical minerals currently includes copper, nickel, lithium (including lithium from brines), cobalt, graphite, rare earth elements, scandium, titanium, gallium, vanadium, tellurium, magnesium, zinc, platinum group metals, and uranium.

Budget 2025 proposes that the list of eligible critical minerals be expanded to include bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten.3 The proposed expansion of the eligible critical minerals list would apply to investments in flow-through shares issued under agreements entered into after Budget Day 25 and on or before March 31, 2027.4

Canadian Exploration Expense

Canada's flow-through share regime generally permits principal business corporations to renounce to subscribers of flow-through shares certain qualified expenditures incurred in the exploration phase of a mineral project's life. Expenditures capable of such renunciation must constitute ""Canadian exploration expenses"" (""CEE"") as defined in the Tax Act, and generally constitute expenses incurred for the purpose of determining the existence, location, extent or quality of a mineral resource in Canada.

Budget 2025 proposes to amend the definition of CEE to clarify that expenses related to determining economic viability or engineering feasibility of a mineral resource do not constitute CEE and are therefore not capable of renunciation pursuant to a flow-through share agreement.5 This amendment is effective as of Budget Day 25.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit

The Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (""CE ITC""), which is a 15% refundable tax credit (reduced to 5% in certain circumstances) in respect of the capital cost of eligible property and equipment used in the generation, storage and transmission of electricity, was first proposed in Budget 2023. Budget 2024 contained further details regarding the design and implementation of the program, proposed to be available in respect of new (i.e., not previously used) eligible property and equipment acquired and available for use on or after April 16, 2024 and before 2035, but the program has not yet been enacted. Budget 2024 restricted availability of the CE ITC to Canadian corporations, certain provincial and territorial Crown corporations, corporations owned by municipalities, corporations owned by Indigenous communities, pension investment corporations, and certain tax-exempt Canadian corporations.

Budget 2025 proposes that the Canada Growth Fund be expressly included as an entity eligible for the CE ITC, effective as of Budget Day 25.6 Additionally, recognizing that the Canada Growth Fund may act as an investor in other eligible entities, Budget 2025 proposes that financing provided by the Canada Growth Fund would not reduce an eligible entity's cost of property for purposes of computing entitlement to the CE ITC.7

Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit

The Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit (""CTM ITC)"" is a 30% refundable tax credit in respect of the capital cost of eligible property and equipment used in the manufacture of renewable energy equipment (e.g., equipment used to manufacture solar, wind, water or geothermal equipment) or the extraction and processing of certain critical minerals (lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements and graphite).

Budget 2025 proposes to expand eligibility for the CTM ITC to support polymetallic extraction and processing by adding to the list of eligible critical minerals the following: antimony, gallium, germanium, indium and scandium.8 The expanded list will apply in respect of property that is acquired and becomes available for use on or after Budget Day 25.

Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Investment Tax Credit

The carbon capture, utilization and storage investment tax credit (""CCUS ITC"") is a refundable tax credit in respect of the capital cost of certain eligible equipment utilized in the capture, utilization and storage of carbon. The rate of the credit ranges from 37.5% to 60% depending on the particular use of the eligible equipment. Under the current legislation, the CCUS ITC is available in respect of expenditures incurred prior to 2041, but the applicable rate of the CCUS ITC gradually decreases between 2031 and the end of 2040.

Budget 2025 proposes to delay the onset of reduced credit rates by five years such that the current full rates will apply to expenditures until the end of 2035 and the reduced rates would begin to take effect thereafter.9

EESI Articles: “Data Center Energy Needs Could Upend Power Grids and Threaten the Climate” and “Data Centers and Water Consumption”","Whitehouse Lands in Belém: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I) held a press call this morning from Belém, where he is serving as the entirety of the U.S. Congressional delegation. In his opening remarks, the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee outlined four key messages that will guide his engagement at COP. First, he said that the Trump Administration represents the will of the fossil fuel industry rather than the will of the American people on climate issues. Second, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is our last “lifeboat” for climate safety. Third, economic shocks of the climate crisis are occurring, including an insurance crisis that is spreading across the U.S. And finally, the fossil fuel industry is the villain in this story of climate action.

EESI Article: “Trade in the Age of Climate Change: The Role of a U.S. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism”

Shipshow: Sen. Whitehouse said that one goal for his engagement at COP30 will be protecting CBAM from what happened to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Net-Zero Framework—a U.S.-led campaign that paused the process for a year, which Whitehouse described as a “thuggish battering.” The internationally-supported landmark IMO proposal would establish a marine fuel standard and impose an emissions fee on the global shipping industry.

EESI Briefing: International Trade and Climate Policy

We Cannot Afford Fossil Fuels: Sen. Whitehouse was also asked if he agrees with Bill Gates’s controversial memo, which urged the climate community to shift its focus from rising temperatures to poverty and disease. Contrasting Gates, he instead proposed a new approach that connects fossil fuel “mischief” to the affordability crisis facing American consumers. Sen. Whitehouse added that innovation will never solve the climate crisis so long as the government continues to subsidize the fossil fuel industry.

EESI Fact Sheet: Proposals to Reduce Fossil Fuel Subsidies

Polluter Presence: Kick Big Polluters Out, a global network of more than 450 organizations, reported that more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists are present at COP30. This is the largest proportion—one in every 25 attendees in Belém—in UNFCCC history. COP30 is also operating under new rules dictating that nongovernment observers must disclose their funding sources and institutional ties. However, this rule does not apply to government delegations, which account for 160 of the 1,600 lobbyists. Larry Rousseau of the Canadian Labour Congress remarked that “this is not what meaningful participation looks like .… If we are serious about an ‘implementation COP,’ if we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we must be serious about protecting these negotiations from the vested interests that profit from delay.”

Drivers of Change: A new declaration on transportation decarbonization and resilience responds to a lack of specific global action on transportation emissions and calls for a shared framework with measurable goals and indicators to monitor progress. It also calls for a “just, inclusive, and tailored” transition; accordingly, the contributions of each participating country will be commensurate with the “differing capacities and realities” of developing countries. The declaration, co-led by Chile and Brazil, has so far been signed by Austria, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. At a press event for the declaration, one Chilean transportation minister touted an 8.5% improvement in efficiency standards for light-duty vehicles, and success in deploying 4,400 electric buses in Santiago. Meanwhile, a representative from the Dominican Republic reported success in meeting the country’s 2020 NDC to build out its capital’s metro system.

Resilience Stats: Race to Resilience, an initiative of the High-level Climate Champions, released its 2025 progress report. During his opening remarks, Chile’s COP25 High-Level Champion Gonzalo Muñoz highlighted the initiative’s accomplishments: 437 million people have been touched by resilience work, 18.4 million hectares of ecosystems in 78 countries have been conserved, and $4.2 billion in adaptation finance has been deployed. Muñoz underscored that the insurance sector has immense ability to accelerate progress. “Insurance companies know that they need to provide new conditions for business to thrive and for governments to be more stable … Race to Resilience can provide the link of the insurance sector to all of the other sectors of the economy to generate the conditions that we require for being resilient.”

EESI Briefing: Risky Business: Insurance in the Era of Climate Change

Women Leading Towards a Net-Zero Future: A session at the We Don’t Have Time studio highlighted inclusive leadership by women who are shaping business and climate policy. We Mean Business Coalition CEO María Mendiluce shared that moving to net zero is not easy, but that when women take the lead on climate, positive change happens through collaboration. “Change is not linear, it’s exponential,” she said. Kerry Constabile, director of decarbonization strategy at Amazon, added that successful business strategies for net zero should focus on collective action over silos or competition. For women leaders specifically, Constabile highlighted the importance of mentorship.

A Win-Win-Win for Climate, Health, and Justice: A UNFCCC side event hosted by the World Health Organization and the United Nations University spotlighted the intersectional approach to climate, health, and justice through the lens of two major breakthroughs: the Belém Health Action Plan, which was released yesterday, and the International Court of Justice’s July decision that states are obligated to protect people from climate harm. This event also featured the release of two special reports supporting the Belém Health Action Plan: one that compiles evidence underpinning the plan, and another that offers guidance on social participation to strengthen the plan’s implementation.

Data Center Discourse: A press conference held by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) focused on artificial intelligence data center infrastructure and the associated climate costs. Jean Su, director of the CBD Energy Justice Program, pointed out that the U.S. consumes more energy from data centers than anywhere else in the world, with dangerous consequences for environmental justice. Speaking on the situation in Brazil, Cynthia Picolo from the Laboratory of Public Policy and Internet shared that the country’s policy framework has been designed to streamline data center development without public input or socio-environmental considerations. Su and her fellow panelists proposed guardrails through the UNFCCC, such as the disclosure of national data center emissions in future NDCs.

City staff briefed the committee on recent federal policy changes that narrow funding and regulatory tools local governments expected to use for climate and electrification work. ""The scaling back of clean energy and electrification incentives was a major shift,"" a staff presenter said, listing reduced production and investment tax credits, cuts to consumer rebates and termination of programs such as the EPA’s Solar for All.

Members and staff discussed how those federal shifts translate to state and local effects. An attendee from the state energy forum reported that the Oregon 'homes' electrification programs remain funded and are moving toward a 2026 implementation timeline, but several Inflation Reduction Act and competitive grant opportunities have largely been exhausted. ""Those funds were already allocated,"" a participant said of state-level programs obligated to proceed.

Committee members flagged administrative actions that could also affect local work, including proposed changes to the EPA endangerment finding and revocation of the Clean Air Act waiver that underpins stricter state vehicle standards. Staff noted the City of Bend filed public comments opposing any rescission of the endangerment finding.

Discussion covered strategic responses: members suggested building coalitions with other cities, targeted advocacy to protect obligated programs, and profiling local infrastructure projects (for example, wastewater treatment upgrades linked to climate-driven costs) to communicate state and federal impacts to elected officials.

Next steps: the committee and staff will monitor federal and state program rollouts, continue coalition participation, and identify policy and funding opportunities to prioritize under a tighter resource environment.

This LCRA power plant will help us both meet the needs of today and prepare our grid for the future.”

Under the grant agreement, LCRA will be eligible to receive a maximum total grant award of $22.56 million for the project, Timmerman Power Plant Unit 1. This grant may be paid in annual payments of up to $2.256 million per year, over a 10-year period.

Annual payments are contingent upon the performance of the power plant. Performance is measured by ERCOT during an annual “test period” and compared to the performance of a reference group of other generation resources in the ERCOT region.

Specific performance metrics are outlined in the PUCT’s CBG rule. Timmerman Power Plant Unit 1’s first test period will run June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2027, after which LCRA may receive its first grant payment, the PUC said.

Energy Transfer Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Energy Transfer, you need to believe in a world where natural gas remains a vital bridge fuel for power generation and data infrastructure, underpinned by long-term contracts with top-tier customers. The recently announced 20-year agreement with Entergy Louisiana reinforces Energy Transfer's ties to fast-growing digital demand but does not materially alter the most immediate catalyst: the successful delivery and ramp-up of large-capacity pipeline projects, nor does it offset the core risk of execution delays and volume shortfalls in key basins.

Recent news about the new Midland Basin processing plant, expected online in late 2026, stands out as directly relevant. This facility complements the long-haul transportation commitments and supports Energy Transfer’s push to reliably meet the surging demand for natural gas tied to both new power plants and hyperscale data center clients, reinforcing near-term growth catalysts while putting additional pressure on execution. The real challenge, however, is the risk of construction delays or cost overruns, which investors should be aware of because...

Energy Transfer's outlook anticipates $99.8 billion in revenue and $6.7 billion in earnings by 2028. Achieving this requires annual revenue growth of 7.4% and a $2.2 billion increase in earnings from the current $4.5 billion.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause new California laws expected to require thousands of companies to report emissions and climate-risk information.

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C. Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades.
Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.
Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.
These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.","(NEXSTAR) – The increasing need for data centers amid the AI boom means the U.S. is looking for additional sources of energy, and the Trump administration thinks nuclear is part of the solution.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.",https://www.wbtw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/11/NuclearWDCWNexstar.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 03:58:22.152144

THE DETAILS

Kimmeridge owned 5.66 million shares in Devon as of the end of September, the filing said. That would equate to an approximately 0.9% stake in Devon, according to Reuters calculations, and make it Devon’s 14th-largest shareholder, according to data provider LSEG. Devon shares fell 1% in the opening 30 minutes of trading on Friday, amid a broader market sell-off, giving the company a market value of around $22 billion.

The 13F filing from Kimmeridge did not detail anything beyond the number of shares held at the end of the third quarter, and whether Kimmeridge has since increased or decreased its position. The filing came at the deadline for investment firms to reveal their holdings in public companies as of September 30.

When approached by Reuters, Kimmeridge declined comment. Devon did not respond to a comment request.

THE PLAYERS

Oklahoma City-based Devon is one of the larger independent U.S. shale producers, with operations in multiple formations including the Delaware portion of the Permian basin covering Texas and New Mexico, the Eagle Ford of South Texas and Oklahoma’s Anadarko basin.

The company’s shares have gained 4% year to date, in line with the performance of the S&P Energy index.

Among the best-known activists within the oil and gas industry, Kimmeridge has in recent years pushed energy companies for better governance practices, prioritizing shareholder returns over expansive drilling programs, and consolidation to achieve economies of scale. Kimmeridge said on November 4 it owned a stake in Devon peer Coterra Energy, and was pushing for leadership changes and the sale of its Appalachia and Oklahoma operations to focus on Coterra’s Delaware basin holding.

Here's what's happening to electricity prices - CNBC,"Spencer Kimball, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/14/data-centers-are-concentrated-in-these-states-heres-whats-happening-to-electricity-prices-.html,"But in at least three states with high concentrations of data centers, electric bills climbed much faster than the national average during that period.

Texas and California In other states, however, the relationship between rising electricity prices and data centers is less clear.
California, meanwhile, has the third most data centers in the nation and the second highest residential electricity prices, nearly 80% above the national average.","Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame with U.S. mid-term elections on the horizon.

Residential utility bills rose 6% on average nationwide in August compared with the same period in the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The reasons for price increases are often complex and vary by region. But in at least three states with high concentrations of data centers, electric bills climbed much faster than the national average during that period. Prices, for example, surged by 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois and 12% in Ohio.

The tech companies and AI labs are building data centers that consume a gigawatt or more of electricity in some cases, equivalent to more than 800,000 homes, the size of a city essentially.

Virginia has the highest concentration of data centers in the world. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the state's recent governor's race in a landslide by campaigning on cost of living. Spanberger put at least part of the blame for rising electricity prices on data centers, promising to make tech companies ""pay their own way and their fair share"" of the escalating costs.

The governor's race could be a harbinger of political headwinds for the AI industry's data center buildout with the mid-term elections just a year away and Democrats zeroing in on affordability as their central issue. In Washington, some Democratic senators are targeting the close relationship that President Donald Trump has developed with the leaders of the major tech companies and AI labs.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's ""sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,"" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from ""being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.""

""The techlash is real,"" said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

""Data centers aren't always great neighbors,"" said Silverman, now a researcher at Johns Hopkins University. ""They tend to be loud, they can be dirty and there's a number of communities, particularly in places with really high concentrations of data centers, that just don't want more data centers.""

Virginia, Ohio and Illinois

Looking at the top fives states for data centers can help sort out some of the politics of data centers from what is actually happening to electricity prices.

Virginia, Illinois and Ohio are among those states and are mostly served by the same grid operator, PJM Interconnection. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., serving more than 65 million people across 13 states including New Jersey where Silverman advised the state utility board.

The PJM grid is facing a major imbalance between demand and supply. It holds auctions to secure electric capacity from power plants to ensure the grid remains reliable. The auction for 2024 to 2025 resulted in a bill of $2.2 billion. The bill then surged more than 500% to $14.7 billion for 2025 to 2026.

An independent watchdog that monitors those PJM auctions found that data center demand, actual and forecast, made up $9.3 billion, or 63% of the total power capacity bill for 2025 to 2026. In the latest auction, prices jumped another 10% to $16.1 billion.

""Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices,"" the firm Monitoring Analytics said in its June Independent Market Monitor report.

Those capacity prices get passed down to consumers in their utility bills, Silverman said. The data center load in PJM is also impacting prices in states that are not industry leaders such as New Jersey, where prices jumped about 20% year over year. Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor's race in the Garden State in part on promising to freeze electric bill increases.

""It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now,"" Silverman said of data center impact on capacity prices.

There are other reasons for rising electricity prices, Silverman said. The aging electric grid needs upgrades at a time of broad inflation and the cost of building new transmission lines has gone up by double digits, he said.

The utilities also point to rising demand from the expansion of domestic manufacturing and the broader electrification of the economy, such as electric vehicles and the adoption of electric heat pumps in some regions.

Although some Democrats are blaming the White House, the conditions that led to rising electricity prices in the PJM region began before the second Trump administration took office.

PJM's process for bringing new electric supply online has ""crashed and burned,"" Silverman said. Tax subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act led to a surge of renewable energy projects waiting for grid connection. PJM is struggling to keep up with approvals, which can take five years in some cases, he said.

PJM's watchdog said the grid may have seen tight power supplies without data centers, but the demand growth would have been slower and allowed more time for the market to address it.

""It is misleading to assert that the capacity market results are simply just a reflection of supply and demand,"" the watchdog said, describing the rapid load growth from data centers as ""unprecedented.""

Trump promised to cut electricity prices in half during his first year in office. That has not happened and is unlikely to happen in the coming years due to tight supply and demand.

""It's hard to see utility bills coming down in this decade,"" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.

Texas and California

In other states, however, the relationship between rising electricity prices and data centers is less clear. Texas, for example, is second only to Virginia with more than 400 data centers. But prices in the Lone Star state increased about 4% year over year in August, lower than the national average.

Texas operates its own grid, ERCOT, with a relatively fast process that can connect new electric supply to the grid in around three years, according to a February 2024 report from the Brattle Group.

California, meanwhile, has the third most data centers in the nation and the second highest residential electricity prices, nearly 80% above the national average. But prices in the Golden State increased about 1% in August 2024 over the prior year period, far below the average hike nationwide.

One of the reasons California's electricity rates are so much higher than most of the country is the costs associated with preventing wildfires. PG&E, the largest utility in the state, said in March that it expects rates to remain stable this year as costs associated with wildfire prevention are taken out of customers' bills.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108214315-17609846542025-10-20t181904z_237714832_rc2ofhalqo8x_rtrmadp_0_amazon-outages-aws.jpeg?v=1760984688&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-11-14 19:01:21.126486

Scout Motors, the emerging automotive manufacturer revitalizing an iconic American brand, has selected Charlotte, North Carolina, as the home of its corporate headquarters.

This major investment will bring more than 1,200 high-quality jobs to the Charlotte region over the coming years and marks a key milestone for Scout Motors as it establishes a central hub for leadership and innovation in advance of the start of production for the Scout Traveler SUVs and Scout Terra trucks.

“Charlotte is the ideal home for Scout Motors — a place as dynamic as our people and brand, where heritage and pride meet progress and innovation,” said Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Scout Motors.

“With a thriving talent pool, world-class universities, and a deserved reputation as a launchpad for bold ideas, Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably.”

This decision follows a comprehensive, multi-state evaluation process as Scout Motors sought the right location to serve as the long-term center of gravity for the company’s corporate operations. Charlotte stood out for its combination of workforce strength, business climate, livability, strategic location, and alignment with the Scout brand’s adventurous spirit.

Just over an hour north of the company’s Production Center that is under construction in Blythewood, South Carolina, the Charlotte location will further cement Scout Motors’ presence in the Carolinas and enable seamless coordination between manufacturing, corporate and technical operations.

The Scout Motors headquarters will be at the Commonwealth development in Plaza Midwood. Conveniently located in the heart of Charlotte’s most eclectic neighborhood, this vibrant development blends restored historic architecture with striking new construction.

Construction is progressing rapidly at Scout Motors’ Production Center in Blythewood, with initial production targeted to begin in 2027. Once it reaches full capacity, the Production Center is expected to create more than 4,000 jobs in South Carolina and attract additional suppliers and economic opportunities to the region.

The Charlotte headquarters will serve as the home base for executive leadership, research and development, finance, IT, sales, marketing, and other key corporate functions.

Scout Motors will begin establishing its Charlotte presence gradually, with plans for initial staffing and office development beginning in 2026 and full headquarters operations scaling up in the coming years.

Steve Spinks, CEO of The Spinx Company, was named the 2025 Business Leader of the Year by The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce (SC Chamber). The award was presented during the SC Chamber’s 46th Annual Summit on Oct. 29.

The SC Chamber selected Spinks “in recognition of his unwavering commitment to improving South Carolina’s business climate, his positive contributions to the state’s business community, and his dedication to giving back to the communities the Spinx Company serves.”

“I am deeply honored to receive this recognition from the SC Chamber,” said Spinks.

“Our business community faces many challenges, and the Chamber continues to be a vital advocate on the frontlines of these issues. I am grateful for the support they provide to me and my colleagues. As business leaders, it’s essential that we speak up and share our stories to advance the Chamber’s efforts on important matters such as tort reform. I look forward to continuing to work alongside the Chamber to strengthen South Carolina’s business community.”

The SC Chamber’s annual Business Leader of the Year award recognizes an individual who is the embodiment of personal success, and who has demonstrated a business record based on ethical conduct and corporate responsibility, public service, contributions to the preservation of South Carolina’s government, and commitment to creating a favorable business climate to improve the state’s economy.

The South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs (SCDVA) announced Retired Army Master Sergeant Major Alfonso J. Boyd as the newest South Carolina Veteran of the Year. The Veteran of the Year award serves as recognition to honor the contributions of veterans in the community.

Boyd served with distinction in the United States Army for approximately 22 years. He returned to his hometown and established a successful JROTC program for Great Falls and Lewisville High Schools.

He later moved to expand the JROTC program at Chester High School. He served Chester County for at least 12 years in that capacity, helping to expand the minds and experiences of his students. Since then, he has aided Chester County veterans in receiving over a million dollars in benefits.

Boyd leads a productive team of disabled American veterans in an effort to seek and uplift other veterans. He leads the way in comradery by joining and encouraging others to become members of multiple veterans’ organizations to strengthen and preserve the attitude of a grateful nation. He is actively involved and supports the county's voting registration efforts.

He established and continues to sponsor the local “Ride For Jesus” Motorcycle Sunday held yearly in Chester County. He works actively in the church to motivate and guide youth to pursue careers and become productive citizens.

Boyd has been the commander of Disabled American Veterans, James D. Wessinger Chapter 19 for 10 years. He planned and executed programs such as 2017 Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Tournament and Banquet, Quilt of Valor ceremonies, three Dinner with a General ceremonies celebrating the three native Chester County Generals, and the first-ever Vietnam Veteran Widow recognition ceremony.

The Veteran of the Year is selected by an Internal Selection Committee from Veteran of the Month candidates during a yearly cycle that runs from November through October.

VELUX, the global leader in skylights and daylight solutions, announced this week that its next-generation skylight won a prestigious Good Housekeeping 2026 Home Reno Award.

VELUX USA is headquartered in Fort Mill, South Carolina.

The VELUX Skylight System is a first-of-its-kind product that features a pre-installed, remote-controlled, solar-powered shade that reduces heat loss in winter and blocks heat gain in summer.

Research shows that when the double-pleated, room-darkening solar shade is in the down position, it enhances the already industry-leading thermal performance by up to 45 percent and blocks up to 19 percent more of the sun's radiation, providing year-round comfort and energy savings.

As homeowners increasingly prioritize wellness and smart home functionality, skylights are emerging as a key upgrade in renovation projects. The venting model of the Skylight System enhances indoor air quality by quickly refreshing stale indoor air, which the EPA reports is often two to five times more polluted than outdoor air.

Studies show that skylights can help remove indoor pollutants up to 15 times faster than vertical windows alone.",http://locable-assets-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/resource/file/1255510/unnamed_20-_202025-11-14T111055.202.jpg?timestamp=1763175492,N,,2025-11-14 21:58:15.143411

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/NuclearWDCWNexstar.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-14 20:00:06.252605

Under its multiple-use mission, BLM manages lands for diverse purposes, including livestock grazing, energy development, recreation, and conservation. The agency also administers onshore federal energy and mineral resources generally.

BLM discretionary appropriations typically are provided in Title I of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations acts. For FY2025, the enacted level in P.L. 119-4, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, was $1,412.0 million. BLM also receives a portion of the discretionary appropriations to DOI for wildland fire management. In addition, BLM receives mandatory (permanent) appropriations under various statutes. The Interior Budget in Brief estimated FY2025 mandatory appropriations at $507.2 million, excluding $95.0 million for BLM deferred maintenance.

FY2026 Discretionary Appropriations Action

For FY2026, BLM is receiving appropriations at FY2025 levels under a continuing resolution (CR)—P.L. 119-137, Division A. The CR is in effect through January 30, 2026, unless other appropriations for BLM are enacted earlier. From October 1, 2025, until November 12, 2025, BLM experienced a lapse in appropriations because no FY2026 appropriations had been enacted. A BLM Contingency Plan (September 2025) addressing operations during a lapse in appropriations stated that many agency activities would cease while setting out exceptions (e.g., emergency response). It also stated that most BLM lands would be publicly accessible but not all services would be available.

For FY2026, President Trump requested $936.1 million for BLM—$475.9 million (34%) less than the FY2025 enacted level of $1,412.0 million. (See Table 1.) Among other changes, the President proposed decreases for BLM's two largest accounts—Management of Lands and Resources (MLR) and Oregon and California Grant Lands (O&C).

On July 24, 2025, the House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 4754 (H.Rept. 119-215), with $1,301.6 million for BLM for FY2026. This would be a decrease of $110.4 million (8%) from the FY2025 level. H.R. 4754 contained decreases for the MLR and O&C accounts, among other changes. Also on July 24, 2025, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 2431 (S.Rept. 119-46), with $1,374.6 million for BLM for FY2026. This would be a decrease of $37.3 million (3%) from the FY2025 level. (See Table 1.) S. 2431 would decrease funding for the MLR account and maintain level funding for the O&C account, among other provisions.

Discretionary Appropriations Accounts

Management of Lands and Resources (MLR). This account, BLM's largest, funds diverse activities and subactivities. For instance, the land resources activity includes subactivities such as rangelands and cultural resources. Table 1 shows amounts for the account's nine main activities (and mining law administration, with offsetting collections). Relative to the FY2025 level of $1,260.5 million, the President sought a $433.1 million decrease for FY2026. Details are not available on how the decrease would be reflected in the accounts' activities.

Relative to FY2025 enacted, the House committee-reported bill would be a $99.9 million decrease for the MLR account. Of the nine main activities (excluding mining law administration), H.R. 4754 would provide decreased funding for five activities, increases for two activities, and level funding for two activities. The Senate committee-reported bill would be a $36.8 million decrease for the MLR account. Of the nine main activities, S. 2431 would provide funding decreases for six activities, funding increases for two activities, and level funding for one activity. Despite its overall lower account total, H.R. 4754 contained higher funding than S. 2431 for some activities.

Oregon and California Grant Lands. This account funds management of more than 2 million acres of forested lands in Western Oregon, primarily for timber production. The FY2025 appropriation was $115.5 million for this account. Relative to the FY2025 level, the President sought a $46.2 million decrease, H.R. 4754 would be a $10.6 million decrease, and S. 2431 would provide level funding.

Range Improvements. The Range Improvements account funds rehabilitation, protection, and improvement of BLM rangelands. By law, 50% of grazing fees collected on BLM lands or $10.0 million—whichever is greater—is credited to a Range Improvements Fund. In recent years, BLM grazing receipts typically were less than $20.0 million annually and BLM received $10.0 million through this account, as in FY2025. For FY2026, H.R. 4754 contained $10.0 million; the President's request and S. 2431 contained $9.4 million.

Service Charges, Deposits, and Forfeitures. This account allows BLM to use monies paid to the agency for activities such as rights-of-way processing and energy and minerals authorizations. The FY2025 estimate was $30.0 million, offset by collections, the same as in the FY2026 House and Senate committee-reported bills. For FY2026, the President estimated $35.0 million, offset by collections.

Miscellaneous Trust Funds. This account appropriates contributions made to BLM (e.g., from individuals, states, and businesses). The FY2025 enacted amount was $26.0 million, the same as contained in H.R. 4754 and S. 2431. The President's request estimated $30.0 million.

Selected Mandatory Appropriations

Deferred Maintenance (DM). BLM estimated its DM at roughly $6.27billion in FY2024, more than five times the FY2019 estimate ($1.1 billion). The increase is largely due to changes in estimation methods. BLM receives both discretionary and mandatory appropriations for DM. Interior appropriations laws provide discretionary funds, with $20.0 million in FY2025. For FY2026, the President's discretionary request for BLM DM is unclear, due to the lack of an FY2026 budget justification. H.R. 4754 contained $17.5 million and S. 2431 included $8.0 million.

For FY2021-FY2025, a primary source of mandatory funding for DM was the National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund (LRF), established by P.L. 116-152, the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA). Under GAOA, BLM's mandatory appropriation was about $95.0 million annually. The effect of this funding is not clear, because appropriations can take multiple years to spend, BLM's DM estimation methods have changed, and other factors. The President's FY2026 request proposed reauthorizing the LRF (p. DH-12), and the Senate Appropriations Committee supported reauthorization (S.Rept. 119-46, p. 5). The House Committee expressed interest in revising bill and report language, if needed, if the LRF is reauthorized (H.Rept. 119-215, p. 10).

The President's FY2026 budget request proposed to direct $17.3 million of mandatory funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to BLM DM in FY2026. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the proposal (S.Rept. 119-46, p. 11). The House Appropriations Committee stated that H.R. 4754 did not reflect an Administration proposal to amend LWCF law to authorize funding for DM (H.Rept. 119-215, p. 9).",https://www.congress.gov/img/opengraph1200by630.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 21:04:40.657269

TerraGen, a renewable energy developer, opened the Monte Cristo I Windpower Project in Hidalgo County, Texas this week. The facility has a 238.5-megawatt capacity — equivalent to powering 81,000 homes a year. And, 78.5 of those megawatts are committed to the copper mine outside Salt Lake City.

The agreement strengthens the company’s renewable energy portfolio in the country, Rio Tinto Kennecott managing director Nate Foster said in a statement.

Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon mine has been in operation for over 120 years and currently is ready to remain active until 2026. Up until recently, there were plans in place to extend mining until 2032, but the company is also preparing feasibility studies to prolong the mine’s life until 2040.

The agreement also follows a switch to renewable diesel to power haul trucks and other heavy machinery equipment at the open-pit mine.

Bill Gates raised some eyebrows last week – and probably the blood pressure of climate activists – when he published a memo calling for a “strategic pivot” on climate change.

In his memo, the Microsoft founder, whose philanthropy and impact investments have focused heavily on fighting climate change, argues that, while global warming is still a long-term threat to humanity, it’s not the only one.

There are other, more urgent challenges, like poverty and disease, that also need attention, he argues, and that the solution to climate change is technology and innovation, not unaffordable and unachievable near-term net zero policies.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” he writes.

Gates’ memo is timely, given that world leaders are currently gathered in Brazil for the COP30 climate summit. Canada may not be the only country reconsidering things like energy policy and near-term net zero targets, if only because they are unrealistic and unaffordable.

It could give some cover for Canadian COP30 delegates, who will be at Brazil summit at a time when Prime Minister Mark Carney is renegotiating his predecessor’s platinum climate action plan for a silver one – a plan that contains fewer carbon taxes and more fossil fuels.

It is telling that Carney is not at COP30 this week, but rather holding a summit with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith.

The federal budget handed down last week contains kernels of the Carney government’s new Climate Competitiveness Strategy. It places greater emphasis on industrial strategy, investment, energy and resource development, including critical minerals mining and LNG.

Despite his Davos credentials, Carney is clearly alive to the fact it’s a different ballgame now. Canada cannot afford a hyper-focus on net zero and the green economy. It’s going to need some high octane fuel – oil, natural gas and mining – to prime Canada’s stuttering economic engine.

The prosperity promised from the green economy has not quite lived up to its billing, as a recent Fraser Institute study reveals.

Spending and tax incentives totaling $150 billion over a decade by Ottawa, B.C, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec created a meagre 68,000 jobs, the report found.

“It’s simply not big enough to make a huge difference to the overall performance of the economy,” said Jock Finlayson, chief economist for the Independent Contractors and Business Association and co-author of the report.

“If they want to turn around what I would describe as a moribund Canadian economy…they’re not going to be successful if they focus on these clean, green industries because they’re just not big enough.”

There are tentative moves in the federal budget and Climate Competitiveness Strategy to recalibrate Canada’s climate action policies, though the strategy is still very much in draft form.

Carney’s budget acknowledges that the world has changed, thanks to deglobalization and trade strife with the U.S.

“Industrial policy, once seen as secondary to market forces, is returning to the forefront,” the budget states.

Last week’s budget signals a shift from regulations towards more investment-based measures.

These measures aim to “catalyse” $500 billion in investment over five years through “strengthened industrial carbon pricing, a streamlined regulatory environment and aggressive tax incentives.”

There is, as-yet, no commitment to improve the investment landscape for Alberta’s oil industry with the three reforms that Alberta has called for: scrapping Bill C-69, a looming oil and gas emissions cap and a West Coast oil tanker moratorium, which is needed if Alberta is to get a new oil pipeline to the West Coast.

“I do think, if the Carney government is serious about Canada’s role, potentially, as an global energy superpower, and trying to increase our exports of all types of energy to offshore markets, they’re going to have to revisit those three policy files,” Finlayson said.

Heather Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, said she thinks the emissions cap at least will be scrapped.

“The markets don’t lie,” she said, pointing to a post-budget boost to major Canadian energy stocks. “The energy index got a boost. The markets liked it. I don’t think the markets think there is going to be an emissions cap.”

Some key measures in the budget for unlocking investments in energy, mining and decarbonization include:

incentives to leverage $1 trillion in investment over the next five years in nuclear and wind power, energy storage and grid infrastructure;

an expansion of critical minerals eligible for a 30% clean technology manufacturing investment tax credit;

$2 billion over five years to accelerate critical mineral production;

tax credits for turquoise hydrogen (i.e. hydrogen made from natural gas through methane pyrolysis); and

an extension of an investment tax credit for carbon capture utilization and storage through to 2035.

As for carbon taxes, the budget promises “strengthened industrial carbon pricing.”

This might suggest the government’s plan is to simply simply shift the burden for carbon pricing from the consumer entirely onto industry. If that’s the case, it could put Canadian resource industries at a disadvantage.

“How do we keep pushing up the carbon price — which means the price of energy — for these industries at a time when the United States has no carbon pricing at all?” Finlayson wonders.

Overall, Carney does seem to be moving in the right direction in terms of realigning Canada’s energy and climate policies.

“I think this version of a Liberal government is going to be more focused on investment and competitiveness and less focused around the virtue-signaling on climate change, even though Carney personally has a reputation as somebody who cares a lot about climate change,” Finlayson said.

“It’s an awkward dance for them. I think they are trying to set out a different direction relative to the Trudeau years, but they’re still trying to hold on to the Trudeau climate narrative.”

“Eliminating for-cause removal protections would expose energy investors to political uncertainty and policy volatility, which risk higher costs for American consumers and producers,” the former FERC commissioners said.

The U.S. Supreme Court should uphold Humphrey’s Executor, a precedent that provides tenure protection to members of independent agencies, a bipartisan group of 11 former commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told the court Thursday.

If the court decides to overturn or modify the precedent, it should specify that its decision does not affect ratemaking commissions such as FERC, the former federal energy regulators said in an amicus brief.

In Trump v. Slaughter, the Supreme Court is considering whether President Donald Trump has the authority to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission at will. The case centers on the 1935 Humphrey’s Executor precedent and follows Trump’s mid-March decision to fire two Democratic commissioners at the five-member FTC.

The U.S. Constitution gives the president the authority to fire commissioners on multimember administrative agencies, such as the FTC, according to a brief filed by U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer. “Congress’s creation of independent agencies since Humphrey’s Executor does not justify retaining the decision,” Sauer said in the brief.

A decision by the court that would let a president fire FERC commissioners without cause and replace them with members of the administration’s party would threaten a key piece of the U.S. economy, according to the brief from the former agency officials.

Following what has been a norm, FERC currently has three Republican commissioners and two Democratic members, all with staggered terms and with the majority coming from the president’s party. The commissioners oversee wholesale electric and gas rates as well as transmission and oil and gas pipeline rates.

“Eliminating for-cause removal protections would expose energy investors to political uncertainty and policy volatility, which risk higher costs for American consumers and producers,” the former FERC commissioners said. “With FERC sitting at the center of the nation’s energy renaissance, discarding its structure could damage America’s global economic position.”

Rates set by FERC help finance $40 billion in new pipelines and power lines annually, and last year more than $1 trillion of oil, natural gas and electricity flowed through that infrastructure, they said.

“Overturning Humphrey’s Executor would bulldoze the structural supports that Congress built into ratemaking commissions to protect its price-setting power from abuse,” the former FERC commissioners said. “By shielding agency action from political control, for-cause removal protections allow ratemaking commissions to sustain stable policies for the long-term benefit of regulated companies and American consumers.”

The former commissioners contend that maintaining for-cause removal protections for ratemaking commissions exercising legislative power would appropriately defer to Congress’ powers over interstate commerce.

At the time, I gave a statement to the press that Louisiana gaining the ability to do its own permitting of carbon capture and storage projects was putting our state “on the verge of a new golden age” of energy production and all that comes with it — new jobs, more state revenue and a stronger economy.

With carbon capture and storage poised to take American energy dominance to new heights, we were years ahead of any other state.

As the Trump administration repealed many of the Biden-era tax credits, it doubled down on support for carbon capture and storage in the One Big Beautiful Bill because the technology is viable and has a market demand.

In the two years that followed Louisiana gaining primacy, industry announced $70 billion in new investment coming to our state, almost all with a carbon capture and storage component. Investments like this coming to fruition can create more of the job opportunities that will keep our kids here in Louisiana and improve lives across our state.

But as we’ve had the opportunity to use this existing technology to supercharge Louisiana's economy past other Southern states, we have spent two legislative sessions debating whether to kneecap the biggest economic advantage Louisiana has had in our lifetime.

Now, almost two years since gaining Class VI primacy, Louisiana has only permitted one project, and Texas is on the verge of surpassing us.

This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it has awarded Texas with Class VI primacy, officially erasing Louisiana's head start. My counterpart at the Texas Oil and Gas Association Todd Staples is saying “Texas is now poised to lead the world in CCS, which means more investment and more jobs for Texans.”

While we no longer have the lead, the game is not over. Companies are deciding, right now, whether it is better to do business in Louisiana or Texas. They are looking at regulatory uncertainty, the influence of antibusiness trial attorneys, and the hesitancy of a state to seize clear opportunities.

The same trends held for clean energy projects more broadly.
Meanwhile, Trump’s Department of Energy recently said it would cancel a number of major grants for EV, battery and other clean energy manufacturing projects, hitting both Democratic and Republican districts.
His office didn’t respond to questions about ending the tax credit and other moves to cut support for EVs.
Lists have circulated showing more widespread DOE grants in line for cancellation, potentially affecting EV, battery, and other clean energy projects, including across a number of red states.","(TNS) — Congressional Republicans opposed sweeping electric vehicle and battery incentives passed under former President Joe Biden, but many praised the individual projects they funded — welcoming new jobs to their districts, hailing developments in press releases and attending ground-breaking ceremonies.

Now, though, many of those same projects supported by 2022's Inflation Reduction Act are under threat.

Amid dramatic policy shifts under President Donald Trump and shaky consumer demand, almost $23 billion worth of EV and battery projects have been canceled this year alone, involving more than 30,000 jobs, with 76 percent of those scrapped investments located in Republican districts, according to Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C., data and policy research firm. Others are being downsized or delayed. And the pace of new investments has stalled since Trump's election, according to E2, a nonpartisan business group focused on energy and the environment.

""It's a self-inflicted wound by our leadership in Washington,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2. “This is an industry that just had left the starting line and was roaring down the track, and all of a sudden, unfortunately, it's facing hurdles and roadblocks that are tough to manage.""

Billions of dollars for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing — along with thousands of promised jobs — flowed to congressional districts represented by Republicans after the IRA's passage, spurred on by the new federal grants, loans and tax credits. In the last three years, well over 60 percent of new battery and clean vehicle projects went to these GOP-controlled districts, according to E2 data. The same trends held for clean energy projects more broadly.

The current flurry of cancellations follows the passage of the GOP-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act and other major policy changes pushed by the president. Trump has described moving from gas cars to EVs as “a transition to hell,” and labeled tax credits supporting such green energy projects a “giant scam.”

His signature tax and spending legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, strips several key supports for EVs, including the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing, which is expected to sharply reduce customer demand over the coming months. Meanwhile, Trump’s Department of Energy recently said it would cancel a number of major grants for EV, battery and other clean energy manufacturing projects, hitting both Democratic and Republican districts.

Three House Republicans representing districts with four combined EV battery gigafactories — stretching from Marshall, Michigan, south to Bowling Green, Kentucky — voted in favor of Trump’s big bill, despite getting among the largest total EV investments of anywhere in the country. These plants and many others, as The Detroit News previously reported, are trying to navigate an increasingly uncertain future, in some cases pausing construction and hunting for new customers beyond the auto industry.

Plenty of GOP lawmakers and other conservative leaders, like state governors, have publicly supported the projects in the past. But now they are carefully navigating a party and president who have taken a hard line against EVs.

U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, represents a district encompassing two massive battery plants at different stages of completion. He celebrated their arrival and the jobs they would bring, noting in 2022 his area was “becoming an EV battery corridor and a leader in manufacturing this technology.”

He, at times, has raised concerns with EVs and the level of subsidies plants received, and other times indicated more support was needed. His office didn’t respond to questions about ending the tax credit and other moves to cut support for EVs.

U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz, a Republican who represents the Kokomo, Indiana, area, where a large EV battery project is partially built, in 2022 signed onto a congressional letter to the DOE endorsing the project, and the agency later approved a $7.5 billion loan for it. Her office didn’t respond to questions about ending the tax credit and other federal support for the project.

U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, a Republican who represents the large Ford Motor Co. battery plant in Marshall that remains under construction, has in the past both celebrated the new jobs but also raised serious concerns with the project’s ties to the Chinese firm — CATL, or Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. — licensing battery technology to Ford. His office declined to comment on the project’s current status or on how he views the future for EVs in the United States with less government support.

In letters sent before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer, some Republicans whose districts had benefited from the IRA’s clean energy tax breaks had flagged concerns about cutting them. But the legislation ultimately passed with overwhelming GOP support in both chambers.

“The state politics of this are really complicated,” especially with the midterm elections coming up, said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan professor emeritus in political science who studies environmental policy.

On one hand, he said, “most congressional districts are in such safe territory, it’s hard to see any partisan shift of control in them.” Yet there are GOP-controlled House districts that have seen broad benefits from clean energy investments where “this really could be a factor.”

Rabe said Republican politicians — especially in safe districts — will be wary of saying anything positive about EVs or other clean energy technologies that could invite backlash from the White House, and perhaps attract a primary challenger backed by Trump.

Even as Republicans on the national stage have fully turned against EVs, it’s been a different story on the state and local level. Several red-state governors, for instance, have fully embraced the EV manufacturing industry over the last couple of years, with their economic development agencies shelling out hundreds of millions to attract new projects.

“The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he wants to be the electric mobility capital of the world,” said E2’s Keefe — and he just might succeed if the Republican governors of nearby South Carolina or Tennessee don’t “beat him to it.”

""These governors and the elected officials that represent these areas are all about bringing jobs and opportunity and investments to their states and regions,” Keefe added, “and unfortunately they're being thwarted by their party leadership in Washington.”

In Hardin County, Kentucky, which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the last election, local leaders say the community has been largely receptive to Ford's massive new BlueOval SK battery plant.

And in Kokomo, Republican Mayor Tyler Moore recently recalled the full-court press that local and state officials used to attract what turned into a $6.3 billion, 2,800-job commitment from battery maker StarPlus Energy. Even then-Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, had shown up in town to personally make the case to company officials, the mayor said, as Indiana sought to beat out neighboring states, including Michigan, vying for the investment.

Moore said he and other local leaders, knowing the potential impacts on the new battery plant, had more recently reached out to Spartz and other members of Congress to try to save the EV tax credit. The effort failed when the credits ended Sept. 30.

“At the local level, political lines need to be blurred,” Moore said. “On the federal level, if there’s a movement that’s more liberal or Democratic-leaning in nature that’s going to benefit our workforce here — and because we’ve got such a strong union presence and such — why would I, as a local Republican mayor, do anything that’s going to jeopardize (that)?”

The Trump administration continues to target EV and other clean energy subsidies that were approved under former President Biden. The latest example is DOE confirmation that it has terminated funding awards for 223 such projects totaling $7.5 billion. A DOE-provided list shows the grants cover everything from hydrogen and fuel cell projects, to university research efforts, to EV advocacy and research. One federal official posted that the moves were to stop “Green New Scam” funding that is fueling “the Left’s climate agenda,” and the cuts were targeting blue states.

A planning document obtained by The News indicated cancellations also might affect $800 million in grants for Michigan, including a $500 million grant for General Motors Co.’s Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant to convert to EV production.

The area is represented by U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett, a Charlotte Republican, who said he'd been in touch with the automaker and the Trump administration about it. Last month, he said his ""top priority will always be standing with the auto workers and ensuring tax dollars are spent effectively as we unwind the Biden EV mandates that tied the hands of our auto industry and stifled our manufacturing economy.""

Barrett praised GM's move to keep making the next-generation gas-powered Cadillac CT5 at the plant — reversing, for now, its EV conversion plans. GM recently acknowledged that a gas-powered vehicle wouldn't qualify for the conversion grant.

Lists have circulated showing more widespread DOE grants in line for cancellation, potentially affecting EV, battery, and other clean energy projects, including across a number of red states. DOE officials have not yet confirmed all of the projects will ultimately be cut off.

In an interview on CNN last month, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright called many of the grants “an incredible, irresponsible deployment of taxpayer money,” and pledged not only to target Democrat-led states. A review continues, he said, and “more project (cancellation) announcements will come.”

The Colorado Energy Office and the governor’s office announced in a joint news release on Thursday that homeowners could be eligible for up to $14,000 in rebates for heat pumps, electric stoves and other appliances and upgrades.

The funding was made available through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a federal law passed under former President Joe Biden that directed hundreds of billions of dollars toward clean energy and climate-related programs.

That included $140.3 million in rebates for Colorado, which are now being passed down to residents as part of the state’s Home Energy Rebate Program .

Here’s what homeowners could be eligible for:

Up to $8,000 for a cold climate heat pump for space heating or cooling

Up to $4,000 for a breaker box upgrade

Up to $2,500 for electric wiring

Up to $1,750 for a heat pump water heater

Up to $1,600 for insulation, air sealing and ventilation

Up to $840 for an electric stove, cooktop, oven or heat pump clothes dryer

The rebates are income-based. Households making below 80% of their county’s area median income are eligible to receive the full amount, while those making between 80% and 150% could see up to half.

The rebates are expected to be available through 2029, or until funds run out. These benefits are different from the federal clean energy tax credits that were also passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, some of which have already been phased out. Credits for electric vehicles ended in September, while credits for home appliances and solar installation expire on Dec. 31.

For the rebate program, homeowners must work with a registered contractor to receive the benefit. More than 55 contractors across Colorado have already begun the registration process, and the state will continue to add to the list of approved contractors over the coming weeks as more contractors complete the process.

EV across USA solar charging stations for off grid vehicle charging

EV Across USA launches to educate and empower Americans nationwide to switch to electric vehicles through outreach, incentives, and community events.

We’re building a future where electric vehicles aren’t just for the few—they’re for everyone,”

— Dan Kost, Executive Director of EV Across USA.

FORT COLLINS, CO, UNITED STATES, November 14, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Bi State Developers, A Colorado Corporation, announces the launch of three groundbreaking initiatives that will transform how America approaches electric vehicle infrastructure in remote locations. The company's flagship innovation centers on revolutionary EV solar charging carports designed specifically for off-grid deployment.

Breaking Through Traditional Infrastructure Barriers

You've seen the headlines about America's strained power grid. You've watched utility companies struggle with the massive costs of extending electrical infrastructure to remote locations. Now, there's a solution that changes everything.

Bi State Developers' new EV solar charging carports represent a fundamental shift in how we think about electric vehicle infrastructure. These systems don't require connection to the traditional power grid, eliminating the primary cost barrier that has kept EV charging out of America's most remote locations.

Alt text: Solar-powered EV charging carports providing off-grid charging solutions for remote locations - EV Across USA sustainable infrastructure

The Three Major Initiatives Reshaping EV Infrastructure

The company's comprehensive approach addresses multiple sectors simultaneously:

Initiative One: Off-Grid Solar Carport Systems

The flagship program delivers complete EV charging solutions that operate independently of electrical grid connections. These systems combine solar energy collection with advanced battery storage, creating reliable charging stations in previously impossible locations.

Initiative Two: Rapid Deployment Framework

A streamlined installation process that reduces deployment time from months to weeks. The modular design allows for quick assembly and immediate operation, perfect for emergency response situations or urgent infrastructure needs.

Initiative Three: Weather-Resilient Backup Systems

Each installation includes integrated propane generator backup systems, ensuring operation during severe weather conditions when solar panels may be covered with snow or sunlight is limited.

Revolutionary Impact on Target Markets

Your organization faces unique challenges when it comes to EV infrastructure. Traditional solutions require expensive grid connections that simply aren't feasible in remote locations. Bi State Developers' approach eliminates these constraints entirely.

Utility Companies benefit from reduced infrastructure investment while still meeting clean energy mandates. The off-grid approach means no costly transmission line extensions or grid capacity upgrades.

Municipalities can now offer EV charging in parks, recreational areas, and other remote public facilities without the prohibitive costs of electrical infrastructure expansion.

National Forest Services gain the ability to support electric vehicle tourism while maintaining environmental integrity. The solar carports actually provide dual benefits – vehicle charging and covered parking areas that enhance visitor experience.

Alt text: Off-grid solar carport EV charging station supporting sustainable transportation in remote areas - EV Across USA clean energy solutions

Military Bases can implement secure, independent charging infrastructure that doesn't rely on civilian power grids, enhancing both operational security and energy independence.

Technical Superiority and Cost Advantages

The engineering behind these systems delivers measurable advantages over traditional grid-tied installations. You save significantly on installation costs by eliminating the need for electrical infrastructure expansion. The modular design means faster deployment and easier maintenance.

Each carport system includes:

High-efficiency solar panel arrays optimized for various geographic locations

Advanced battery storage systems with extended lifecycle ratings

Intelligent charging management that prioritizes vehicle needs

Weather monitoring systems that automatically engage backup power

Remote monitoring capabilities for maintenance scheduling

The propane generator backup system represents a crucial innovation. When solar panels are compromised by snow cover or extended periods of limited sunlight, the backup system ensures continuous operation. This reliability factor makes the systems suitable for critical infrastructure applications where charging availability cannot be compromised.

Eliminating EV Range Anxiety in Remote Areas

The fundamental promise of these systems extends beyond simple cost savings. They address a critical barrier to EV adoption – the fear of being stranded in remote areas without charging options.

American electric vehicle owners will no longer face limitations on where they can travel. National parks, remote recreational areas, and rural destinations become accessible to EV drivers when reliable charging infrastructure exists independent of traditional electrical grids.

This accessibility factor drives economic development in previously underserved areas. Rural communities can now attract EV-driving tourists and residents without waiting for costly grid infrastructure improvements.

Market Timing and Industry Disruption

The launch comes at a critical moment in American energy infrastructure development. Traditional electrical grids face increasing strain from extreme weather events, growing electricity demand, and aging infrastructure. Bi State Developers' solution provides resilience through independence.

Industry analysts project significant growth in off-grid charging solutions over the next decade. Early adopters gain competitive advantages in serving EV-driving customers while contributing to national energy security goals.

The timing also aligns with federal infrastructure initiatives and clean energy mandates. Organizations implementing these systems often qualify for various tax incentives and grant programs, further improving the economic case for adoption.

Scalability and Future Expansion

You can start with double-carport installations and expand as demand grows. The modular design allows for seamless capacity increases without major infrastructure changes. This scalability makes the systems attractive for organizations with uncertain future charging demand.

The technology platform also supports future enhancements. As battery technology improves or new charging protocols develop, existing installations can be upgraded rather than replaced.

With Qcells residential solar panels on one in three rooftops in the US, a growing fleet of energy storage systems, and demand for clean energy spiking across the globe, Qcells faced mounting constraints to scale its operations. Holding it back was its infrastructure. Built on fragmented open-source tools across thousands of decentralized sites, Qcells’ existing platform was slowing innovation, hindering customer expansion, and affecting its ability to offer solar energy to millions around the world.

“We set our sights on streamlining operations in the US first by shifting our focus from energy troubleshooting to energy innovation,” says Sanjeev Lakkaraju, Senior Director of Data Engineering at Qcells North America. “We knew that unifying our data on a dependable, secure, AI-driven data platform would help us deliver on our mission to provide solar energy to communities around the world.”

Delivering on its mission with a unified data architecture

Qcells chose Microsoft Fabric and Azure to unify its fragmented data, fragile pipelines, and limited scalability. “Speed is innovation. Fabric streamlines operations by eliminating complexity and providing a single analytics pipeline that can accelerate time to market for new solutions,” says Youngchoon Park, President of Grid & Energy Service Business at Qcells North America.

Before the transformation, the Qcells tech team could only dream of connecting thousands of solar and energy storage assets into a single, responsive network. Now data flows seamlessly across the Qcells organization. Power BI dashboards bring real-time insights to every decision-maker, turning hours of manual reporting into instant, actionable intelligence. Semantic models ensure that everyone—from field technicians to executives—speaks the same data language, no matter what position they hold. And with Azure SQL as the highly secure, scalable backbone, Qcells can finally focus on what matters: delivering new energy solutions at speed.

“We’re thrilled this transformation was conceived, executed, and championed by our Qcells internal team,” says Lakkaraju. “The native connectors and low-code data flows in Fabric made interoperability with systems like Snowflake, SAP, and Salesforce much easier—so our small team could move a lot faster.”

Powering energy innovation that gets results

With its transformed digital backbone, Qcells confidently launched two groundbreaking, customer-facing energy solutions: the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) portal and Fleet Manager platform—energy service solutions built on Azure. The VPP portal brings together solar panels, batteries, and EV chargers, turning everyday customers into active participants in the energy grid. With a few clicks, homeowners and businesses can sell surplus power back to the grid, earning rewards while strengthening community resilience. Meanwhile, the Fleet Manager platform gives Qcells’ operations teams a real-time window into every site, enabling predictive maintenance and seamless optimization across the country.

“Fabric Real-Time Intelligence and Power BI in our Fleet Manager platform gives us live visibility into thousands of sites, instantaneously,” says Shuai Zhang, Director of Grid & Energy Service Operations at Qcells North America. “Before Fabric, troubleshooting a single site could take hours. Now, with real-time insights, Qcells’s teams can spot and solve issues across thousands of sites in seconds, delivering energy reliability and cost efficiencies customers can feel.”

“In the past, deploying traditional solutions of this size could take years. With Microsoft Fabric, we accomplished product release from project inception in just nine months, achieving a nearly 50% improvement in time to market compared to our previous benchmarks,” says Park. “Also, scaling from hundreds to millions of users no longer requires additional management overhead, resulting in another 40% savings and a 25% decrease in site licensing fees. This is how we drive efficiency and innovation.”

“We can now respond to real-time grid events and provide instant insights to our stakeholders,” says Lakkaraju. “This has not only improved our operational agility but also accelerated our mission for clean energy.""

Scaling confidently to better serve the world

“We’re now scaling this unified approach to markets worldwide, offering rapid innovation, operational efficiency, and customer-centric solutions that fuel homes and businesses globally,” says Park. “We plan to offer our service to third parties, including OEMs, commercial partners, and global enterprises. Integration with Qcells will be as simple as flipping a switch. Fabric makes that possible.”",https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico?v2,N,,2025-11-14 19:59:09.252583

Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane (also known as ethylene dichloride) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA preliminarily determined that 1,2-dichloroethane presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment driven by certain conditions of use (COUs).

1,2-Dichloroethane Draft Risk Evaluation

EPA is preliminarily determining that 1,2-dichloroethane presents unreasonable risk of injury to human health driven by inhalation and dermal risks to workers and inhalation risks to occupational non-users (ONUs) from 15 COUs. EPA is also preliminarily determining that 1,2-dichloroethane presents an unreasonable risk to the environment driven by chronic exposure to aquatic invertebrates via surface water and sediment exposures from two COUs. The agency did not preliminarily identify a risk of injury to human health or the environment from five other COUs evaluated for 1,2-dichloroethane. For COUs with unreasonable risk to workers, these preliminary risk determinations do not reflect the use of personal protective equipment (PPE); however, as the draft risk evaluation shows, the use of PPE may reduce exposures to and mitigate risk from 1,2-dichloroethane.

EPA is preliminarily determining that 1,2-dichloroethane exposure to consumers or the general population, associated with any COU, does not significantly contribute to unreasonable risk of injury to human health.

Read the draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane.

Next Steps

Upon publication of the Federal Register notice, the agency will accept public comments on the draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane via docket EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0427 on regulations.gov for 60 days.

EPA’s Science Advisory Council on Chemicals (SACC) reviewed the draft human health hazard assessment for 1,2-dichloroethane during the September 2024 SACC meeting. The draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane released today reflects both SACC and public comments on the draft human health hazard assessment for 1,2-dichloroethane. Additionally, the methodologies used in the development of the 1,2-dichloroethane draft risk evaluation have been previously peer reviewed by the SACC. Therefore, EPA is not soliciting additional external peer review of the draft risk evaluation for 1,2-dichloroethane.

After the agency has considered public comments, EPA will issue a final risk evaluation that includes its determination as to whether 1,2-dichloroethane represents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-standard-og.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 19:59:39.359729

The laws are the most sweeping of their kind in the nation, and a collection of business groups argued in an emergency appeal that they violate free-speech rights.

The measures were signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023, and reporting requirements are expected to start early next year.

Lower courts have so far refused to block the laws, which the state says will increase transparency and encourage companies to assess how they can cut their emissions.

The Chamber of Commerce asked the justices to put the laws on hold while lawsuits continue to play out.

One requires businesses that make more than $1 billion a year and operate in California to annually report their direct and indirect carbon emissions, beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

That includes planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels directly, as well as releases from activities such as delivering products from warehouses to stores and employee business travel. The Chamber of Commerce estimates it will affect about 5,000 companies, though state air regulators say it will apply to roughly 2,600.

The other law requires companies that make more than $500,000 a year to biennially disclose how climate change could hurt them financially. The state Air Resources Board estimates more than 4,100 companies will have to comply.

“Without this Court’s immediate intervention, California’s unconstitutional efforts to slant public debate through compelled speech will take effect and inflict irreparable harm on thousands of companies across the country,” the companies argued.

Companies that fail to publish could be subject to civil penalties. ExxonMobil also challenged the laws in a lawsuit filed last month.

The state has argued that the laws don’t violate the First Amendment because commercial speech isn’t protected the same way under the Constitution.

In 2023, Newsom called the emissions-disclosure law an important policy and of the state’s “bold responses to the climate crisis, turning information transparency into climate action.” The environmental group Ceres has said the information will help people decide whether to support the businesses.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule last year requiring some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, but the agency paused the regulation amid litigation.

The conservative-majority Supreme Court has cast a skeptical eye on some environmental regulations in recent years, including a landmark decision that limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in 2022, and another that halted the agency’s air-pollution-fighting “good neighbor” rule.

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said the EPA has failed for months to release a report on PFNA, a type of PFAS contaminant. PFAS, often called “forever chemicals,” are man-made substances found in air, groundwater and drinking water across the country.

“There is no legitimate reason for this delay,” Pingree said.

“This isn’t just a few states,” she added. “Every state has these impacts.”

Pingree sent a letter last month to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding an update, but she said the agency has not responded. She argues the government shutdown is hardly a viable excuse.

In a statement, the EPA cited ongoing litigation as the reason for the delay and said “the Trump EPA is committed to addressing PFAS and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable.”

In May, the agency upheld Biden-era drinking water regulations on two PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, but said three others — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — remain under legal review.

Pingree said she worries the agency is bowing to industry pressure.

“We’re just worried that this follows a pattern of this administration being … bullied by the industry that, of course, doesn’t want to have to deal with this chemical,” she said.

Environmental advocates also accuse the EPA of ignoring clear scientific evidence. Kyla Bennett, a former EPA scientist who now works with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said PFAS exposure can cause developmental issues in children, obesity, cholesterol problems and thyroid disorders.

“My fear is that with these people running the agency, the American people are going to start to get sicker and sicker,” Bennett said. She described the environment for current EPA scientists as “hostile.”

Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who co-chairs the bipartisan PFAS Caucus, is also sounding the alarm. She accuses the EPA not only of delaying the PFNA report but of slowing PFAS cleanup work at military bases across the country.

Dingell joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers who sent a letter of concern to the Defense Department last month. She also plans to continue pressing the issue with Trump administration officials.

“I’m going to be relentless in pushing for action,” she said.",https://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2025/11/EPANexstarDCB.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-14 19:01:28.818228

Trump, urging the administration to finalize key biofuel policies that strengthen domestic energy production, promote the use of U.S.-grown soybean oil, and ensure that federal programs prioritize American feedstocks over imports.

In the letter, the groups commended the President’s leadership in restoring access to the China market and expanding global export opportunities for U.S. soybeans and soybean meal, while emphasizing that strong domestic market growth is critical. The organizations called on the administration to finalize policies that expand domestic biofuel production, include strong volumes for biomass-based diesel (BBD) in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and limit the generation of RFS credits for foreign feedstocks and biofuels.

The U.S. soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion over the past four years to increase capacity by over 25 percent and today crushes more than half of all soybeans grown by U.S. farmers. To maximize their impact, these investments depend on stable federal policy frameworks that provide certainty for biofuel producers and preserve the economic value of U.S. soybeans here at home.

The organizations also highlighted the importance of the U.S. Department of the Treasury finalizing guidance for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit without delay. Timely and clear implementation is essential to providing market certainty for ongoing biofuel investment and ensuring that the benefits of the 45Z credit flow to fuels produced from North American feedstocks, as directed by Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The Company expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.
Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.
These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.","(NEXSTAR) – The increasing need for data centers amid the AI boom means the U.S. is looking for additional sources of energy, and the Trump administration thinks nuclear is part of the solution.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C. Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades.
Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

These are not nuclear explosions,” Wright claimed in a Fox News interview over the weekend.","(NEXSTAR) – The increasing need for data centers amid the AI boom means the U.S. is looking for additional sources of energy, and the Trump administration thinks nuclear is part of the solution.

These data centers, along with electric cars and an increase in U.S. manufacturing, will sharply raise demand for energy, according to Berkeley Lab reports.

But is nuclear a viable option?

“This is an industry that boomed from the mid-‘50s to the late ‘70s,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who also delivered the keynote address at this year’s American Nuclear Society conference in D.C.

Nuclear energy infrastructure, however, has slowed in recent decades. The average age of a nuclear power plant in the United States is 41 years old.

Wright says the Trump administration is seeking to build small, modular reactors — a new, and cheaper alternative, though one that hasn’t been demonstrated.

“President Trump’s bold objective was to get multiple reactors running before our 250th anniversary [on] July 4 next year,” he said. “I think we’ll get one or two under that deadline.”

The timeline also took a hit during the government shutdown, as the agencies assigned to oversee the projects were shut down. Nuclear regulators were furloughed; the Department of Energy also furloughed 80% of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the country’s nuclear stockpile.

That latter group, from the NNSA, had never before been furloughed, even amid a shutdown. This unprecedented move was blasted by Democratic lawmakers, but Wright claims it was somewhat necessary due to the length of the shutdown.

“We’ve never had a shutdown so long. That is the longest government shutdown in history,” Wright said.

Trump, too, had recently raised concerns that the U.S. would be resuming nuclear weapons testing after more than 30 years, indicating as much in an interview with “60 Minutes” amid the shutdown.

Wright, however, said that would not be the case.

Accoding to the latest data from the California Energy Commission, 13,880 MW come from 248 large utility-scale projects.
Within the United States, California leads all states on installed storage capacity, followed by Texas with roughly 9 GW.
At COP30 on Thursday, Newsom also announced that California is joining the Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge, a COP initiative backed by more than 100 countries and organizations.
We’re deploying more battery storage than any state in America, building a stronger grid, cutting pollution, and making abundant clean energy even more affordable.”","Addressing the UN Climate Change Conference in Brazil, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that California has installed 16,942 MW of cumulative energy storage projects, underscoring the state’s climate leadership.

The new total represents an increase of about 1,200 MW in the past six months and a 2,100% surge since Newsom took office in 2019. California has now built one-third of the 52 GW of storage capacity estimated to be needed by 2045 to reach its clean energy goals – a major step toward redefining grid reliability and accelerating the state’s transition to 100% clean energy, the governor said.

Accoding to the latest data from the California Energy Commission, 13,880 MW come from 248 large utility-scale projects. The rest is from behind-the-meter battery systems installed on more than 200,000 homes (2,213 MW) and businesses, schools and local government facilities (849 MW). Within the United States, California leads all states on installed storage capacity, followed by Texas with roughly 9 GW.

The state’s rapid battery buildout has allowed the grid to remain stable even as renewable penetration has grown. California has now gone three consecutive years without needing a Flex Alert – a voluntary call issued by CAISO asking residents and businesses to reduce electricity use during the early evening peak to prevent rolling blackouts. Batteries have played a pivotal role in avoiding those alerts by providing power as solar generation declines.

Newsom emphasized that storage investments, along with new clean generation, have strengthened the grid’s ability to meet demand during heat waves and extreme weather. Even as California added record amounts of new clean energy – now supplying nearly 67% of in-state retail electricity sales – and faced warmer-than-average temperatures in 2024, the grid held steady, underscoring its growing reliability and resilience.

Battery systems now provide enough capacity to serve about one-quarter of California’s record peak demand for several hours. Meanwhile, the California Independent System Operator, which serves roughly 80% of the state’s electricity consumers, has on average met demand with 100% clean energy for nearly six hours every day so far this year.

At COP30 on Thursday, Newsom also announced that California is joining the Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge, a COP initiative backed by more than 100 countries and organizations. California will be the first subnational government to join the pledge, which sets global targets to deploy 1,500 GW of energy storage, double worldwide grid investments, and build 25 million kilometers of new transmission by 2030 – essential steps toward achieving the global renewable-energy tripling goal agreed to at COP28.

Newsom is the most senior US political figure attending the COP30 summit in Belém after President Trump took the unprecedented step of not sending a US delegation. Appearing on several panels earlier this week, Newsom criticized the administration’s absence as an abdication of responsibility and referred to Trump as an “invasive species” whose dismissal of the climate crisis is “an abomination.”

In his latest adress, Newsom said: “Donald Trump’s reckless energy agenda puts China first and America last – letting Beijing seize the global clean energy economy and the good-paying jobs, manufacturing, and economic prosperity that come with it. California won’t stand by and watch.”

“While Donald Trump is failing, the Golden State is leading.

“This investment allows us to accelerate from excellence to exponential growth – transforming knowledge into impact for North Carolina, the nation and the world.”","Historic commitment elevates N.C. A&T’s cumulative support from Scott to $108 million, fueling its ascent as leading doctoral research HBCU

EAST GREENSBORO, N.C. (Nov. 14, 2025) — North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University today announced a record $63 million investment from philanthropist and author MacKenzie Scott, the largest single gift ever received by the university.

Five years after Scott’s landmark $45 million gift, this latest commitment raises her total support to $108 million. It affirms her confidence in the university’s vision, leadership and trajectory as one of the nation’s most dynamic research institutions.

“No investor in higher education history has had such a broad and transformational impact across so many universities,” said Chancellor James R. Martin II. “North Carolina A&T is deeply grateful for Ms. Scott’s reaffirmed belief in our mission and for the example she sets in placing trust in institutions like ours to drive generational change through education, discovery and innovation.”

Accelerating A&T’s Strategic Vision

Scott’s investment will catalyze A&T’s next phase of growth, aligning directly with Preeminence 2030: North Carolina A&T Blueprint, which envisions the university as a model for 21st century doctoral research land-grant excellence. The investment will advance A&T’s pursuit of the Research 1-Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production designation in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, strengthen student success outcomes and expand research and innovation in key disciplines including engineering, agriculture, life and health sciences, data science and artificial intelligence.

“This is an investment in A&T’s capacity to solve society’s most pressing challenges,” said Martin. “It will accelerate our momentum as a research and innovation powerhouse, ensuring that A&T continues to lead at the intersection of technology, human progress and social transformation.”

Trust, Stewardship and Long-Term Impact

Like her previous investment, Scott’s latest commitment is unrestricted – reflecting both trust in A&T’s leadership and confidence in its stewardship. This flexibility will enable the university to deploy resources strategically to achieve sustainable impact that extends well beyond campus borders.

A&T’s growing endowment – expected to surpass $300 million following this investment – will strengthen its ability to attract exceptional talent, support transformative research and create opportunities that change lives and communities for generations.

“On behalf of the North Carolina A&T Board of Trustees, I extend our deepest gratitude to Ms. Scott for her extraordinary gift,” said board chair Gina L. Loften ‘90. “This transformative investment will strengthen our capacity to fulfill A&T’s mission of exemplary teaching, transformative research and impactful public service. It expands opportunities for our students, empowers innovation that addresses critical challenges and further elevates A&T’s leadership among the nation’s premiere institutions of higher learning.”

A&T’s Rising National Profile

Since Scott’s initial investment in 2020, A&T has experienced a period of remarkable growth and recognition. Enrollment now exceeds 15,000 students, making A&T the first historically Black college or university (HBCU) to surpass that milestone. The university was recently ranked America’s No. 1 public HBCU in LinkedIn’s national college rankings and has secured more than $350 million in research awards over the past five years. Faculty innovations have led to the development of numerous new patents and the establishment of expanded national partnerships in agriculture, the life sciences, autonomy and advanced manufacturing.

At least 36 states have crafted subsidies specifically for data center projects, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit watchdog group that tracks economic development incentives. But only 11 of those states — Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — disclose which companies receive those incentives.

In a new study, the organization examined a lack of transparency in data center deals, which are proliferating across the country as technology demands increase.

Despite data centers' significant energy requirements, states frequently compete heavily to land the projects, which invest millions or even billions into new construction. But the study noted those projects often employ nondisclosure agreements, project code names and subsidiary names that hide the firms behind the new server farms.

""Only when governments disclose information on which companies get public money and what they do with it can there be meaningful analysis, greater public participation, and wiser use of public financial resources,"" the report says.

Good Jobs First specifically examined sales and use tax exemptions that benefit data centers. The study does not account for local property tax abatements, corporate income tax credits and discounts on electricity and water rates.

Virginia, the largest data center market in the world, forgoes nearly $1 billion in state and local sales and use tax revenue each year without telling the public which companies benefit or how much they receive, the study said.

Good Jobs First underscored state calculations that show data center subsidies do not provide a return on taxpayer investments. It recommends states eliminate or curtail data center subsidies. ""At the very least, states should practice full transparency,"" the report said.

Good Jobs First says states must reassess their investments in data centers with federal cuts looming that will strain state finances.

The 70-year-old lawmaker said he had come to Belem, Brazil, to underline that Trump's aggressively pro-fossil-fuel policies do ""not represent the American people"" -- and that the United States is forfeiting a vast economic opportunity.

""Right now, we are deliberately losing our competition on solar, on wind, on battery storage, on electric vehicles and all the support technologies that go into that,"" he said in an interview.

""It is a huge self-administered blow that Trump is doing, entirely to pay back his fossil fuel donors.""

Whitehouse said that as he arrived in the Amazonian city in the early hours of the morning, he passed numerous Chinese electric vehicle dealerships -- a sight that hammered home his message about America falling behind.

The Trump administration declined to send an official delegation to the COP30 summit, leaving only a few prominent Democrats to attend in an unofficial capacity, including California Governor and presumed 2028 presidential-candidate Gavin Newsom.

""The Trump administration does not represent the American people on climate,"" said the Rhode Island senator, known for his long-running ""Time to Wake Up"" speeches on global warming in Congress.

""They are doing political work for the fossil fuel industry and the public very much supports climate action,"" he continued, citing a slew of polls to back his point.

For Whitehouse, one of the few remaining pathways to climate safety lies in carbon pricing, which he argued is essential to spark the innovation needed to slash emissions.

""If it's free to pollute, there's really no pathway to safety,"" he said, reiterating his support for Europe's carbon border tax -- a key point of contention with developing countries at COP30.

Trump, who received hundreds of millions of dollars from oil and gas giants during his presidential campaign, pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement for a second time on the day he returned to office.

Trump and Republican lawmakers have rolled back clean-energy tax credits and scrapped incentives for electric vehicles, prompting General Motors to scale back production.

Whitehouse's team said he will meet with ""heads of state, lawmakers, private sector leaders, environmental champions, and civil society leaders"" during his visit.

But he cannot take part in negotiations on the COP's outcome.

Attending the conference itself was made more complicated by resistance from the State Department, he said, which forced him to get his badge through a nonprofit organization.

""I've never seen the State Department be completely unwilling to support members of Congress traveling on an official Congressional Delegation, even to the point of refusing to help us get badges.""

In August 2021, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a Final Order (Final Order) declaring Goldston Oil Corporation (Goldston) as a Responsible Party with respect to the McBay Oil and Gas State Superfund Site, a 20.32-acre former oil refinery and reclamation plant near Grapeland, Texas. This decision was in connection with a single 1986 sale of 165 barrels of skim oil, allegedly containing two calculated barrels of basic sediment and water (BS&W).

In its Final Order, TCEQ designated Goldston, along with 146 other parties, as a Responsible Party with respect to this Superfund Site and attendant cleanup obligations. TCEQ made this Responsible Party designation under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, and exercised jurisdiction over Goldston, when its mere alleged statutory violation was, again, the sale of 165 barrels of skim oil to a third-party as part of a legitimate commercial transaction in 1986 without any knowledge of the purchaser’s planned use of the 165 barrels.

Thus, 35 years after the fact, TCEQ issued this Final Order labeling Goldston as a Responsible Party, with all the attendant legal issues and ramifications. With only 3-weeks notice of the TCEQ hearing to address this matter, the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) stepped forward in support of Goldston and the broader Texas oil and natural gas industry. TIPRO issued letters to TCEQ Commissioners in support of Goldston and officially engaged with legal counsel, but to no avail. Goldston’s Responsible Party designation was affirmed, despite a lack of corroborating evidence.

Goldston, in Travis County District Court, contested the TCEQ Final Order. TCEQ’s improper usurping of the RRC’s jurisdiction, in derogation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) and TCEQ, which has been formally memorialized in the Texas Administrative Code, was a centerpiece of Goldston’s position in this Travis County District Court lawsuit.

In connection with Goldston’s legal efforts, and through TIPRO’s steadfast, active involvement, RRC Commissioners meaningfully supported Goldston’s position, specifically with respect to Goldston’s effort to preserve the RRC’s jurisdiction and enforce the Petroleum Exclusion. This support included each Commissioner’s having written correspondence to express to Attorney General Paxton their respective concerns. RRC Chairman Jim Wright prepared and submitted an Affidavit in support of Goldston’s filed Motion for Summary Judgment, which is available here.

Through the pursuit of persistent legal efforts from the representation of counsel Gary Zausmer with Butler Snow LLP and the consistent support from TIPRO over the last four years, Goldston achieved a proposed settlement by July 2025. The Agreed Final Judgment, open for public comment until mid-August 2025, included TCEQ’s release and covenant not to sue Goldston, effectively removing them as a Responsible Party upon finalization, marking the first known outcome in Texas under similar circumstances of challenging this designation for historical skim oil sales.

On November 4, 2025, the Travis County Court Judge officially signed the settlement document. In this extraordinary outcome for Goldston and decisive victory for the Texas oil and natural gas industry, the Travis County District Court approved an Agreed Final Judgment resolving all claims in the litigation (D-1-GN-21-005412) against TCEQ over Goldston’s alleged responsibility for cleanup at the McBay Oil & Gas Superfund Site in Houston County, Texas. Key elements in the agreement include:

Exoneration as Responsible Party: The Court explicitly ruled Goldston is not a Responsible Party under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. TCEQ conceded that publicly available exculpatory evidence at the RRC (proving the transaction involved only unused, unrefined, uncontaminated crude oil) would have prevented their initial designation as a Responsible Party, retroactively clearing Goldston of all site-related liabilities.

Full Mutual Releases: TCEQ fully releases Goldston from any past, present, or future claims, costs, or actions tied to the site, Final Order, or litigation, including under state/federal environmental laws (e.g., CERCLA). Goldston receives complete protection from cost recovery, contribution, or indemnity demands.

No-Sue Covenants: TCEQ covenants never to sue or pursue Goldston for site remediation, response costs, or related enforcement, except narrow reservations (e.g., future post-Effective Date activities or criminal matters unrelated to this case). Goldston’s reciprocal covenant is limited to this dispute.

Contribution Protection: Goldston gains ironclad statutory shields (Tex. Health & Safety Code §361.277; CERCLA §§107/113) against third-party claims for recovery or indemnity on matters addressed here, ensuring no downstream financial exposure.

No Payments or Costs: Zero dollars awarded to either party; each bears its own litigation expenses, sparing Goldston and the TCEQ any additional financial burden.

This is a landmark ruling for the Texas oil and gas sector, safeguarding operational predictability and limiting regulatory overreach. By exonerating Goldston from liability as a Responsible Party under the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act for a 1986 transaction involving unused, unrefined, and uncontaminated crude oil, the settlement averts broader industry risks and reinforces key legal protections and jurisdictional constraints.

If this settlement was not achieved, it could have established a concerning norm requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and assume liability for the downstream fate of every barrel sold, potentially spanning decades. This would impose massive administrative and financial burdens, as companies might face retroactive cleanup costs for waste generated by unrelated third parties at distant sites like the McBay Superfund location. The judgment in favor of Goldston eliminates this threat in this context, allowing producers to focus on core operations without perpetual tracking obligations that could stifle innovation and increase costs across Texas’ vast energy market.

The ruling upholds critical exemptions for petroleum under environmental law, confirming that routine, traditional crude oil transactions fall outside the scope of hazardous waste regulations like the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. This mirrors federal CERCLA exclusions for petroleum not otherwise designated as hazardous, preventing the erosion of protections that have long shielded the industry from undue liability. Without this affirmation, routine sales could trigger Superfund-style claims, exposing companies to unpredictable remediation demands and undermining Texas’ pro-energy framework.

The settlement solidifies the RRC’s primary authority over oil and gas waste management, as evidenced by the reliance on RRC documentation (e.g., Form P-18) to prove the transaction’s legitimacy. This Judgment stands to curb potential encroachment into RRC-regulated domains, such as production, disposal, and recycling of oilfield wastes. By drawing clear lines, it supports efficient oversight under the RRC’s specialized rules, reducing duplicative regulation and ensuring Texas remains a leader in energy production without conflicting agency mandates.

Over the past five days, the Governor stepped up as the leading U.S. presence on the global stage – forging strategic partnerships with world leaders, strengthening international coalitions, and advancing solutions that protect the planet while building sustainable, equitable economies.

The Governor learned about local cultural conservation practices and nature-based solutions that support local livelihoods while protecting the forest. Today’s visit underscored the central role Indigenous communities play in safeguarding the Amazon — and the planet.

Strengthening California’s global climate partnerships at COP30:

Chile: California and Chile signed a memorandum of understanding regarding exchanging information, developing best practices, and cooperating on methane emissions reduction. Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas and the partnership between California and Chile opens up new opportunities for both partners to cooperate on methane reduction in waste, agriculture and energy sectors.

Colombia: California and Colombia signed a partnership to advance joint efforts on forest conservation, methane reduction, climate resilience, and clean energy development. The memorandum of understanding deepens coordination on protecting the Amazon, strengthening biodiversity, and expanding nature-based climate solutions that support sustainable and equitable economic growth.

Nigeria: California signed a memorandum of understanding with Nigeria on sustainable urban transportation, green ports, low-carbon transportation fuels, climate adaptation, methane detection and abatement policies, greenhouse gas emissions and air quality, and academic exchange and university partnerships. The partnership will build upon our shared commitment to sustainable growth, accelerate the transition to zero-emission transportation, and expand opportunities for the next generation.

Brazil: Governor Newsom signed a declaration of intention with the Brazilian federal government on innovation, as well as a partnership with the State of Pará to strengthen cooperation on wildfire prevention and response — enhancing forest monitoring, identifying areas most at risk, and sharing research and expertise to improve firefighting and emergency management. In September 2025, California announced a new partnership with Brazil to advance market-based carbon pricing programs, clean transportation expansion, including zero-emission vehicles and low-carbon fuels, and strengthen air quality management through enhanced monitoring and regulatory controls. The partnership also focuses on the conservation of 30% of lands and coastal waters by 2030, including nature-based solutions and biodiversity protection.

California’s climate leadership in action

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 81% in that same time period, all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

California also continues to set clean energy records. In 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve this level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day this year.

Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage has reached 16,942 megawatts (MW) and about a 1,200 MW increase in storage capacity in the past six months. Under Governor Newsom’s leadership, California has now built one-third of the storage capacity estimated to be needed by 2045 to reach 100 percent clean electricity.

It’s just one example of a crisis facing the U.S. power grid that can’t be solved simply by building more power lines, approving new power generation, or changing out grid software. The equipment needed to keep the grid running – transformers that regulate voltage, circuit breakers that protect against faults, high-voltage cables that carry power across regions, and steel poles that hold the network together – is hard to make, and materials are limited. Supply-chain bottlenecks are taking years to clear, delaying projects, inflating costs and threatening reliability.

Meanwhile, U.S. electricity demand is surging from several sources – electrification of home and business appliances and equipment, increased domestic manufacturing and growth in AI data centers. Without the right equipment, these efforts may take years longer and cost vast sums more than planners expect.

Not enough transformers to replace aging units

Transformers are key to the electricity grid: They regulate voltage as power travels across the wires, increasing voltage for more efficient long-distance transmission, and decreasing it for medium-distance travel and again for delivery to buildings.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the U.S. has about 60 million to 80 million high-voltage distribution transformers in service. More than half of them are over 33 years old – approaching or exceeding their expected lifespans.

Replacing them has become costly and time-consuming, with utilities reporting that transformers cost four to six times what they cost before 2022, in addition to the multiyear wait times.

To meet rising electricity demand, the country will need many more of them – perhaps twice as many as already exist.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation says the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, hit roughly 120 weeks – more than two years – in 2024, with large power transformers taking as long as 210 weeks – up to four years. Even smaller transformers used to reduce voltage for distribution to homes and businesses are back-ordered as much as two years. Those delays have slowed both maintenance and new construction across much of the grid.

Transformer production depends heavily on a handful of materials and suppliers. The cores of most U.S transformers use grain-oriented electrical steel, a special type of steel with particular magnetic properties, which is made domestically only by Cleveland-Cliffs at plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Imports have long filled the gap: Roughly 80% of large transformers have historically been imported from Mexico, China and Thailand. But global demand has also surged, tightening access to steel, as well as copper, a soft metal that conducts electricity well and is crucial in wiring.

In partial recognition of these shortages, in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy delayed the enforcement of new energy-efficiency rules for transformers, to avoid making the situation worse.

Further slowing progress, these items cannot be mass-produced. They must be designed, tested and certified individually.

Even when units are built, getting them to where they are needed can be a feat. Large power transformers often weigh between 100 tons and 400 tons and require specialized transport – sometimes needing one of only about 10 suitable super-heavy-load railcars in the country. Those logistics alone can add months to a replacement project, according to the Department of Energy.

Other key equipment

Transformers are not the only grid machinery facing delays. A Duke University Nicholas Institute study, citing data from research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, shows that high-voltage circuit-breaker lead times reached about 151 weeks – nearly three years – by late 2023, roughly double pre-pandemic norms.

Facing similar delays are a range of equipment types, such as transmission cables that can handle high voltages, switchgear – a technical category that includes switches, circuit breakers and fuses – and insulators to keep electricity from going where it would be dangerous.

For transmission projects, equipment delays can derail timelines. High-voltage direct-current cables now take more than 24 months to procure, and offshore wind projects are particularly strained: Orders for undersea cables can take more than a decade to fill. And fewer than 50 cable-laying vessels operate worldwide, limiting how quickly manufacturers can install them, even once they are manufactured.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines. Manufacturers including Siemens Energy and GE Vernova have multiyear backlogs as new data centers, industrial electrification and peaking-capacity projects flood the order books. Siemens recently reported a record US$158 billion backlog, with some turbine frames sold out for as long as seven years.

Alternate approaches

As a result of these delays, utility companies are finding other ways to meet demand, such as battery storage, actively managing electricity demand, upgrading existing equipment to produce more power, or even reviving decommissioned generation sites.

Some utilities are stockpiling materials for their own use or to sell to other companies, which can shrink delays from years to weeks.

There have been various other efforts, too. In addition to delaying transformer efficiency requirements, the Biden administration awarded Cleveland-Cliffs $500 million to upgrade its electrical-steel plants – but key elements of that grant were canceled by the Trump administration.

Utilities and industry groups are exploring standardized designs and modular substations to cut lead times – but acknowledge that those are medium-term fixes, not quick solutions.

Large government incentives, including grants, loans and guaranteed-purchase agreements, could help expand domestic production of these materials and supplies. But for now, the numbers remain stark: roughly 120 weeks for transformers, up to four years for large units, nearly three years for breakers and more than two years for high-voltage cable manufacturing. Until the underlying supply-chain choke points – steel, copper, insulation materials and heavy transport – expand meaningfully, utilities are managing reliability not through construction, but through choreography.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/702071/original/file-20251112-56-a9byln.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C187%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-14 16:01:34.656532

The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.

Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day’s available sunlight. The Sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.

Janta Power takes a different approach. The company’s pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.

NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS

Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the Sun’s path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.

Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.

Janta’s towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.

Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.

The company’s 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.

That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.

For businesses and communities, Janta Power’s technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.

For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.

The first-in-the-nation standard requires most new buildings to install efficient, electric appliances such as heat pumps instead of health-harming gas, propane, and fuel-oil systems.

The Empire State was on the precipice of fully enacting the All-Electric Buildings Act that Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed in 2023. The first-in-the-nation standard requires most new buildings to install efficient, electric appliances such as heat pumps instead of health-harming gas, propane, and fuel-oil systems. Regulators finalized the rules in July; they were set to take effect Dec. 31.

But on Wednesday, the state agreed to not enforce the zero-emissions standard until the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals makes its decision on a two-year-old lawsuit challenging the All-Electric Buildings Act. Climate-advocacy nonprofit Earthjustice expects that’ll delay the landmark building code until at least the fall of 2026, as oral arguments have yet to be scheduled.

The legislation ​“was a promise that New York would stop locking families into expensive, polluting fossil-fuel systems and start building for the future,” said Democratic Assemblymember Gabriella Romero on a Thursday call with reporters. ​“Delaying this law is a total betrayal of that promise.”

Putting the all-electric building code on ice is an abrupt about-face for the administration. On Oct. 1, the state filed a brief saying that New Yorkers would ​“suffer irreparable harm if the Code amendments are delayed from taking effect,” because it would allow new buildings to depend on fossil-fuel equipment that would generate greenhouse gases and local air pollution for decades to come. That, in turn, would drive up the health, agriculture, and broader economy costs imposed by worsening climate catastrophes.

But just over one month later, Hochul signaled openness to pausing the law after a group of 19 Democratic state legislators raised concerns about its affordability and impact on the grid. Multiple studies have found that the grid has ample room for all-electric new buildings, and making them the default would benefit the planet and people’s pocketbooks.

Hochul’s office has positioned the delay as a pragmatic step that could expedite implementation of the rule in the long term. By voluntarily pausing the law, Hochul may be trying to avoid a potentially multiyear holdup should the case reach the U.S. Supreme Court and get on its ​“shadow docket.” That emergency process is typically less transparent than the court’s usual decision-making protocol.

“The Governor remains committed to the all-electric-buildings law and believes this action will help the State defend it, as well as reduce regulatory uncertainty for developers during this period of litigation,” Ken Lovett, energy and environment spokesperson for Hochul, told Canary Media. She’s ​“resolved to providing more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for New Yorkers.”

Earthjustice argues that there’s no reason to expect that the groups challenging the law would’ve been able to hamper its implementation if the state hadn’t made the concession itself.

The plaintiffs in the case — including the New York State Builders Association, National Association of Home Builders, and National Propane Gas Association — allege that the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act preempts the all-electric buildings law. That same reasoning was used to overturn Berkeley, California’s pioneering gas ban. In July, New York prevailed when a federal district judge in the state rejected the argument.

Hochul’s decision to slow-roll building electrification is part of her administration’s realpolitik embrace of fossil fuels. Last Friday, New York regulators signed off on a Trump-backed underwater gas pipeline, after having denied the requisite permits three times before. The same day, her administration announced a deal to allow a gas plant that mainly powers cryptocurrency mining to keep operating for at least five years. She also has yet to sign a bill that repeals gas-hookup subsidies. Legislators passed it in June.

Hochul justified recent moves by saying the state needs to ​“govern in reality.”

“We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans, including our New York delegation, which is why we have adopted an all-of-the-above approach,” she said last week in a statement.

Democratic Assemblymember Sarahana Shrestha said she’s deeply concerned about the administration’s trajectory. Reducing the lethal and expensive harms born of the climate crisis ​“is not an optional goal,” she said. ​“Really, we’re talking about a disruption to our economy if we don’t act — in the same way the pandemic disrupted our economy.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2217332123.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=bd7db0f30e6c6f489573564316ebc059,N,,2025-11-14 18:01:54.953361

""Our partnership with ABB reflects Applied Digital’s commitment to redefining what is possible in data center scale and performance,” said Todd Gale, chief development officer, Applied Digital.
Last month, the firm made the first 50MW phase of its Ellendale, North Dakota, data center ready for service.
Elsewhere, Applied has a 106MW facility in Jamestown, North Dakota, known as JMS01, and is also planning a 200MW facility in Iowa.","US data center developer Applied Digital has expanded its partnership with power technology provider ABB, which will supply power infrastructure for the company’s second AI campus in North Dakota, US.

The expansion builds on an agreement struck earlier this year between the two firms, under which ABB committed to supply Applied with its HiPerGuard Medium Voltage Static Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) for Applied's 400MW data center campus in Dickey County, North Dakota.

""The medium voltage architecture developed with Applied Digital is a big step forward for large-scale AI facilities. Working together closely from the start enabled both teams to identify opportunities to drive higher efficiency, performance, and reliability, along with lower costs and faster time to market,” said ABB smart power president Massimiliano Cifalitti.

The expansion will see ABB deliver low and medium-voltage electrical architecture for Applied's planned 300MW Polaris Forge 2 campus near Harwood, North Dakota. ABB will also deploy its HiPerGuard UPS at the Forge 2 campus. The campus is scheduled to reach operational status in 2026 and 2027, phased across two buildings.

""Our partnership with ABB reflects Applied Digital’s commitment to redefining what is possible in data center scale and performance,” said Todd Gale, chief development officer, Applied Digital. ""Polaris Forge 2 represents the next evolution of our AI Factory model - beginning with two 150MW buildings with the ability to scale - solidifying our position as a leader in delivering high-performance, energy-efficient AI infrastructure.”

The new data center is located some 140 miles (225.3km) northwest of the new site. Groundbreaking at the Ellendale site occurred in 2022, with the data center since repurposed from cryptomine hosting to AI and HPC as part of a major deal with AI cloud firm CoreWeave. Last month, the firm made the first 50MW phase of its Ellendale, North Dakota, data center ready for service.

Elsewhere, Applied has a 106MW facility in Jamestown, North Dakota, known as JMS01, and is also planning a 200MW facility in Iowa.

Earlier this month, Applied signed a deal with US energy technology provider Babcock & Wilcox for more than 1GW of natural gas capacity to power one of its AI data centers.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/applied_digital_ellendale_north_d.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-11-14 16:03:01.751261

About First Solar, Inc. First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) is America's leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company.","TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today announced that it will establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the Company’s international fleet. The Company expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

“This is the most important ethics, accountability and transparency legislation to move through the House and the Senate.
HB 5055 would allow sergeants to enforce the rules of the House or the Senate and the laws of the state.
This would enable sergeants to attend committee meetings with members as security and to investigate threats against members as individuals.
The supplemental for the 2025 budget contains funding for both the House and Senate to implement HB 5055, Hall said.","House Republicans rolled out their plan for economic development and job creation during a press conference Thursday afternoon.

HB 5292 and HB 5293 would create an annual payroll credit equal to 50% of the income tax withheld for each new job a company creates for up to 10 years.

To qualify for the credit, the positions created would have to be permanent, full-time jobs created after Sept. 30, 2025, and pay at least 150% of the median regional wage.

The program is capped at $50 million annually through 2036, with $10 million set aside for businesses with under 100 employees, $15 million set aside for businesses with between 100 and 999 employees, and $25 million set aside for businesses with more than 1,000 employees.

By capping the program at $50 million a year, taxpayers would get a better value, House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, said.

“It’s going to ensure that all kinds of businesses benefit,” he said. “This isn’t a project where four or five businesses … get the benefit. This is something everyone can aspire to … and once they perform, they’ll get the benefits.”

Rep. Mike Hoadley, R-Au Gres, said this was different from previous incentives, like the Strategic Outreach Attraction and Reserve Fund, because it doesn’t provide taxpayer money to businesses up front.

“The biggest benefit to this is it’s not corporate welfare,” he said. “It’s not upfront taxpayer money. It is sincerely performance incentives that goes right to job creators in this state.”

The program would apply to all businesses, Rep. Mark Tisdel, R-Rochester Hills, said.

“It is not limited to simply large employers- every employer from Main Street right on up to the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit could participate,” he said.

Any business can apply for the tax credit, regardless of industry, Hoadley said, adding, “the incentive starts around the first job.”

The plan works because the incentive doesn’t provide money up front, Tisdel said.

“It’s crediting against incremental growth,” he said. “We’re not mortgaging the future.”

The proposal also addresses Michigan Economic Growth Authority credits, which are still being paid out after being approved under the former Gov. Jennifer Granholm administration.

Most of those credits are 15 years old or older, and the total value of the remaining MEGA credits will start declining in 2026, dropping to nearly nothing in 2030, and they are scheduled to fully expire in 2031.

The bills roll MEGA credits into the Corporate Income Tax.

“We’re not walking away from the commitment,” Tisdel said. “We’re simply going to restructure that and try to get that out in 10 payments over the next 10 years.”

Tisdel said that although he believes the state has a responsibility to honor the promises made with MEGA credits, the economy has changed.

“It’s a new time. It’s a new opportunity for us to reset, and the economic realities in Michigan, in the U.S. and globally, require a kind of reevaluation of where we are and how we move forward on these programs,” he said. “There are a new set of rules, but we do recognize that we made a commitment.”

How the existing MEGA credits and the proposed tax credit would interact is unclear, Tisdel said.

“What I would advocate for is that the MEGA credits are a promise we made … and we still have an outstanding balance on those,” he said. “Now, if you want to grow jobs, if you want to add incremental jobs in the interim, I think that would be wonderful to reward those as well because we’re not digging into our base like we are with the MEGA credits.”

Tisdel said compliance and transparency would be handled through the Department of Treasury.

“They would have to be issuing to the state treasury affidavits, elements of their annual tax returns, indication that these incremental jobs have been in place,” he said. “Probably not a very good idea to lie to the Treasury Department.”

Hall said he wanted to get something done on economic development before the end of the year, and that he was talking to Sen. Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, about this bill package.

“We’ll make a deal, and we’ll come up with something hopefully by the end of the year,” he said.

Michiganders who received unemployment benefits they may not have qualified for during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic could see relief from having to pay that money back to the state under a bill advanced to the Senate floor on Wednesday.

SB 700, sponsored by Sen. Darrin Camilleri, D-Trenton, would waive the recovery of benefits paid by the Unemployment Insurance Agency between Feb. 7, 2020, and Sept. 5, 2021, by designating them the result of the agency’s administrative or clerical error and prevent recovery unless a determination is made that the payments were obtained fraudulently.

The bill was reported by the Senate Labor Committee just after UIA Director Jason Palmer testified before its members regarding the agency’s efforts to recoup nearly $2.7 billion in state unemployment funds doled out in 2020 and 2021 to people who should not have qualified for them, largely due to an administrative discrepancy between state and federal government regulations at the time.

“This was a time of panic, anxiety and confusion for so many across Michigan. Our neighbors found themselves suddenly out of work and unable to make ends meet as we took steps to contain the spread of COVID-19. During this challenging time, these UI payments were what kept food on the table and paid rent for millions of Michiganders,” Camilleri said. “I was proud that we fulfilled our responsibilities of state government and provided for the most vulnerable of our residents across the state by expanding payments and putting more money in the pockets of those left without a stable income. Now, as families are dealing with the on-again, off-again SNAP benefits and ACA premiums that are set to skyrocket due to Republicans in Congress refusing to act, these same residents are being told they owe thousands of dollars back to the state due to no fault of their own.”

The bill is supported by the Michigan AFL-CIO, Michigan Laborers District Council and Michigan Nurses Association and opposed by the Detroit Regional Chamber, Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and Michigan Small Business Association.

The Michigan Alliance for Legal Reform announced its formation on Wednesday focused on two goals: regulations for outside parties funding lawsuits and reviving the “open and obvious” doctrine in premises liability.

The newly formed alliance of legal experts and business groups told reporters that their main goal is to push for policy that restores Michigan to a healthy legal climate they say has been lost in recent Michigan Supreme Court decisions to expand liability.

Zach Rudat, the alliance’s director, also director of legal reform at the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said recent court rulings and pending litigation in the state undermine fairness and predictability of the legal process.

Advocates for plaintiffs disagree with the group’s agenda, saying the effort for fairness and balance is just “a guise.”

“Michigan’s legal system impacts everyone, even when they don’t set foot in the courtroom,” Rudat said. “Right now, the average Michigan household pays over $3,000 annually on a trickle down toward tax dollars that families could otherwise spend on groceries, mortgage payments, or monthly bills.”

Tiger Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform Association, explained that during his tenure at the association, Michigan used to be a state enacting key reforms, but has recently been on the radar for courts working outside of what is appropriate to expand liability, naming Michigan “a judicial hellhole.”

Starting in 1999, when a 5-2 conservative majority took hold of the Supreme Court, business groups extolled the state’s legal climate following a series of rulings restricting liability. However, starting in 2018, that 5-2 conservative majority has flipped, going from 4-3 conservative to 4-3 liberal to 6-1 liberal this term.

One of the group’s efforts is to revive the “open and obvious” doctrine for defense of premises liability, which shielded business or property owned from injury caused by a hazard that was reasonably visible. It was also used to dismiss meritless claims early in litigation.

This statute exists in 41 states. The Michigan Supreme Court abolished the doctrine in 2023, overturning a 2001 precedent.

Brad Ward, vice president of public policy and legal affairs for Michigan Realtors, said restoring this doctrine would lower costs, liability and “the threat of loss and abuse for property owners.”

There is legislation in the House now that could codify the liability doctrine and restore the status quo before the ruling (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Aug. 20, 2025).

Another key issue for the alliance is being spearheaded by Rep. Mike Harris, R-Waterford Township, by introducing HB 5281 to add transparency measures to third-party litigation funding, or when an outside investor finances another person’s lawsuit for a cut of the winnings.

The bill would require a funder to register with the state, prohibit funders from influencing how the case is handled, ban “foreign adversaries” from funding Michigan lawsuits, and cap funder earnings to protect compensation for the plaintiffs.

“Without oversight, the system has quietly grown into a $15 billion shadow industry that distorts justice,” Harris said. “Right here in the state today, a funder can bankroll a lawsuit without anyone knowing – not the judge, not the defendant, sometimes not even the plaintiff themselves. These financiers can influence settlement decisions, drag out litigation, and take a hefty portion of the award. It’s an unregulated marketplace that invites abuse, and it undermines the confidence in our courts here in the state, and it’s not just a fairness issue, it’s really a security issue.”

Harris said these “are common sense guardrails” and follow suit from states like California and Tennessee that have enacted transparency law on these funding mechanisms.

There are no clear examples of this in the state, Rudat said, because of this lack of transparency. Instead, he pointed to examples across the country like a man in New York who used third-party funders for his lawsuit on the health effects of the 9/11 cleanup effort, didn’t read the fine print, and lost all his earnings in the suit.

Wendy Block, senior vice president of business advocacy at the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said when the legal system does not function fairly, it can affect job creation, business investment, and even consumer costs.

“For Michigan to compete and win, we need clear and consistent laws that have staying power,” Block said. “The reality is this, though, businesses invest when and where they have confidence. This includes confidence in the fairness of our legal system. This is a key economic competitiveness factor.”

Brian Calley, Chief Executive Officer of the Small Business Association of Michigan, said for all the smaller operations in the state, one lawsuit can take them out with rising costs, and that the current legal environment created by “poor decisions from the Michigan Supreme Court” puts those businesses at risk.

Rudat said the new alliance is purely a legislative lobbying effort at this point and is not focused on any campaigns like judicial elections.

During the late 1990s and 2000s, business groups – led by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce – poured millions into the Supreme Court races. Recent cycles have not seen that type of investment. The Democratic nominees for the Supreme court of late have widely outspent their Republican opponents.

The Michigan Association for Justice, which represents trial attorneys, said in a statement that the alliance is just “a corporate-funded effort to strip away the rights of Michigan consumers, workers, and patients under the guise of ‘fairness’ and ‘balance.’”

“This is not a grassroots coalition, it’s an insurance industry wish list wrapped in talking points,” Steve Pontoni, executive director of the association, said in a statement. “For 30 years, the courts benefited the business community, making Michigan one of the worst places in the country for consumers and workers. It is not surprising that a coalition of groups that benefit from exploiting consumers, patients and workers would gather to try to put their thumb on the scales of justice again.”

The association said the reinstatement of the doctrine would allow negligent property owners to evade responsibility and that the transparency measures would make it harder for people to stand up to industries with much higher means than them.

The association also said job losses because of “tort tax” has been “repeatedly debunked.” The association urges lawmakers to reject the efforts that would “weaken” the justice system.

Bipartisan bills intended to improve transparency in the approval of legislative earmarks sailed through both chambers on Thursday following an agreement by both chambers to extend the period in which they must be introduced prior to being voted on.

Members of the Senate voted Thursday in favor of a compromise on bills that would create a 45-day period in which legislative earmarks would have to be submitted prior to being put up for votes.

Amended versions of the legislative earmark transparency package, HB 4420 and SB 596, were passed 35-0.

The House quickly moved to pass the legislation later Thursday, too.

Thursday’s votes mark a compromise struck to set a requirement that legislative earmarks must be submitted at least 45 days prior to being voted on in both legislative chambers.

As introduced, the Senate had set a 10-day period prior to voting. Last month, the House amended SB 596 to set the period at 60 days and sent it back to the Senate along with an amended version of HB 4420 (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Oct. 30, 2025).

The Senate votes on Thursday came after last month’s threat by House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, to refuse movement on any Senate bills through the House if the Senate does not move the earmark bills with a 60-day provision.

Another key change made to SB 596 states that any legislative earmark request introduced during the first year of a two-year legislative session applies to both fiscal years. Those introduced in the second year of the two-year legislation session would apply only to the final years of the cycle.

A substitute for HB 4420 was also adopted prior to the vote to align the bills.

“We want to get value for your dollars as taxpayers,” Hall said during a press conference Thursday afternoon. “This is the most important ethics, accountability and transparency legislation to move through the House and the Senate. … It’s going to make budgets much better.”

SB 596 passed the chamber unanimously, 101-0, as did the concurrence votes for HB 4420 and HB 5055. HB 5055 would allow sergeants to enforce the rules of the House or the Senate and the laws of the state. This would enable sergeants to attend committee meetings with members as security and to investigate threats against members as individuals. The bill would also authorize sergeants to work with local law enforcement, giving them statewide jurisdiction.

The supplemental for the 2025 budget contains funding for both the House and Senate to implement HB 5055, Hall said.

“That will allow us the opportunity to hire more sergeants and the equipment we need to carry this out,” he said.

Hall said although he would have liked to see legislation requiring public hearings for the earmarks, it was more important to get the 45 days.

“If I put in a requirement that forces them to have a committee hearing and they’re just going to make it a show committee hearing, why am I fighting for this?” Hall said. “I think it’s the best practice and we should have a committee hearing, and that’s something that we’re going to aspire to.”

During the press conference, Hall repeatedly emphasized that he was not getting enough credit for the transparency legislation on earmarks.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Michigan-capitol-building-at-night.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 11:05:57.997983

In Carlisle, a sleepy town in the heart of Pennsylvania Trump country, solar energy appears to have escaped the black hole of partisan politics. Or at least, that’s been the experience of Carlisle Area School District superintendent Colleen Friend, who has met little resistance spearheading a project to install a solar array about the size of a football field at a local elementary school.

The project is itself the beneficiary of a political anomaly, the $25 million “Solar for Schools” initiative. The bill that created it last year made it through Pennsylvania’s divided state government even though basically nothing else on energy policy has reached the governor’s desk in recent years.

It also remains one of the few policy bright spots for clean energy advocates in the state budget deal struck on Wednesday, which saw the program re-upped for another year, even as Democratic leadership agreed to exit a potentially paradigm-shifting regional carbon cap-and-trade program.

Friend isn’t surprised that Solar for Schools proved a survivor in a budget battle that dragged on for months. The bill signing ceremony in Harrisburg last year was “very bipartisan,” she said. Her school district received $252,000 in funding for the ongoing project, and Friend now plans to apply for more.

“We already know the next building we’re going to put a solar array at,” she said.

But does distributed solar — the diffuse installation of small-scale arrays on the roofs and lawns of homes, businesses and municipal buildings — present a wider bipartisan opportunity to move climate policy forward in the acrimonious world of Pennsylvania politics?

Long a fossil fuel juggernaut with bountiful reserves of coal and gas, Pennsylvania at one point was also considered an innovator on renewable energy. But it has since fallen into position as a national laggard. Fights over fracking and former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s move to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the interstate cap-and-trade program known as RGGI, had ground down any progress in the space to next to nothing.

On paper, distributed solar appears to have breakthrough potential. Solar for Schools’ wide bipartisan support last year followed what advocates describe as a herculean effort by its sponsor, state Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler. The Philadelphia Democrat and chair of the House Energy Committee toured the state to discuss its opportunities, focusing on economic benefits and reaching across the aisle.

Flora Cardoni, deputy director of the nonprofit PennEnvironment, helped champion the program and said it proved to be a rousing success in its first year, with 88 applications requesting $88 millionin funding, more than three times what the budget allowed. Ultimately, 73 schools were awarded a total of $22.6 million in May.

“There’s clear demand, that more schools applied for the Solar for Schools grants than were able to receive an award,” Cardoni said. “We would just love to see even more schools follow their lead.”

Distributed solar also stands to benefit from deregulatory policy, a potential attraction for conservatives. Among five energy-related statehouse bills packaged under Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s “Lightning Plan,” the one that promises to adjust regulations to facilitate “community energy” projects — picture neighbors subscribing to a local communal solar array — has garnered the most bipartisan support.

Distributed solar can also avoid perhaps the biggest hurdle to solar development in Pennsylvania at present: the backed-up queue of grid operator PJM Interconnection, which oversees large, utility-scale energy development. Utility-scale renewable projects are waiting years for approval to hook in, but distributed solar skips that step entirely.

Ron Celentano, president of the Pennsylvania Solar & Storage Industries Association, thinks it has high potential. He points to a 2018 analysis by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that found rooftop solar could account for 10 percent to 35 percent of all solar power in the state by 2030, if lawmakers enact solar-friendly policies.

“I tend to push hard on [distributed solar], because it’s often a missed opportunity in a lot of areas,” Celentano said.

And yet, advocates wonder how much ground can be covered, especially in light of the new budget agreement. Cardoni believes that RGGI could have generated about $1 billion annually for Pennsylvania to invest in clean energy technologies while forcing a market shift toward renewables, an impact that dwarfs an additional $25 million slated for the second year of Solar for Schools.

In the lead-up to the budget breakthrough, advocates had also heard that Lightning Plan bills could be part of the negotiations. But in the end, there was nothing to suggest that any of them, including the community energy bill, would be brought up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.

“We would need to get a lot of policies like that passed to make up for RGGI in terms of carbon reduction,” Cardoni said.

And even the calculus behind Solar for Schools is shifting. Advocates say that many school districts had planned to combine state grant money with federal financial incentives covering another 30 percent to 50 percent of costs, depending on demographic factors. But those credits are now scheduled to expire next year after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled them back.

With a deadline to start construction looming next summer, Celentano said that timelines are getting tight for school districts to go through bidding and design, never mind finding a contractor in the midst of a rush.

Pennsylvania schools continue solar projects despite tax rollbacks

Adding to the problem is what Celentano said are delays at Pennsylvania electric utilities such as PECO and PPL, which have their own waiting lines for applicants seeking to connect rooftop solar and other similarly sized ground arrays to the grid. PECO did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokesperson for PPL confirmed that approval for larger examples of such projects may take “one to three years, depending on complexity.”

“We remain committed to processing interconnection applications as quickly and efficiently as possible,” PPL spokesperson Dana Burns wrote in an email, adding that the utility is “actively working to minimize delays and prioritize transparency and communication with applicants.”

No schools districts have yet announced abandoning their plans, but Celentano said some clients have asked him to run new analyses on what costs will be without federal tax credits. He predicts many projects wouldn’t survive a scenario in which they lose up to half of their funding via federal incentives, and the impact on interest for a second year of funding remains unknown.

“There’s a little bit of concern to some of these schools: Are we going to make it?” Celentano said.

Bipartisan Opportunities

On paper, distributed solar has political potential across red and blue counties in Pennsylvania. In a September report analyzing the first year of Solar for Schools, PennEnvironment calculated that approximately 5,000 schools across the commonwealth have the physical capacity to install solar. Collectively, they would save a potential $342 million over the lifetime of the systems, while powering the equivalent of 187,000 homes and reducing carbon emissions by the equivalent of 300,000 cars.

“The rooftops of Pennsylvania’s roughly 5,000 schools are often flat and unshaded, making them excellent sites for solar panels,” the report noted.

What’s more, rural counties, with their often-abundant space, stand to benefit considerably. PennEnvironment calculated that Lancaster County, quintessential home of the Pennsylvania Dutch, had the second highest cost-savings potential, after Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County. And while the nonprofit found that the 20 counties that stand to save the most in total are the most populated, it is mostly rural counties that would save the most per school.

“That just speaks to the vast savings potential,” Cardoni said.

The 2018 Department of Environmental Protection solar potential report calculated that distributed solar would also employ more people than large “grid-scale” arrays, at about 3 to 5 jobs per megawatt hour installed, compared to less than 2.5 jobs.

In a high-end scenario where 35 percent of the state’s solar mix came from rooftop arrays, the analysis predicted the creation of more than 32,000 total jobs. That’s about triple the current number employed in Pennsylvania’s waning coal industry.

Fiedler, the Solar for Schools sponsor, said she leaned into the economic benefits of solar and sought the support of labor unions as she traveled across the commonwealth stumping for the program. It worked: In final votes on the legislation last year, 10 of 101 House Republicans and 21 of 28 Republican senators joined all Democrats in voting yes.

“We think as individual households the bills that we get are high,” Fielder said. “And they are, they’re going up. But for school districts it’s even more—add a couple of zeros on the end.”

Jim Gregory, a former three-term Republican state representative who is now executive director of the Pennsylvania Conservative Energy Network, said he also makes economic and reliability arguments when lobbying his former colleagues on supporting renewable energy. He believes the political gridlock on energy will have to give way soon, given dramatically escalating electricity ratesfor consumers in the state. He’s pitching solar as an important and quickly scalable option within an “all of the above” energy strategy, with the ability to take “pressure” off fossil fuel supplies.

“We can’t continue to do nothing. … The pain is going to overcome the fear that people have of a pipeline in their backyard on the Left, or a solar field on the farmer’s property next to theirs in rural Pennsylvania,” Gregory said.

But it’s not clear how much wider bipartisan support for solar truly exists in the legislature. Some efforts this year seem to have stalled out.

Democratic State Rep. Peter Schweyer’s community energy bill passed the House in May by a 114-89 margin, with more Republican support than Solar for Schools received. But the bill has remained in a Senate committee ever since, with no signs of movement even in the wake of a budget deal.

Democratic State Rep. Robert Merski, meanwhile, introduced a measure to put solar on municipal buildings like firehouses. But that legislation has remained stuck in a House committee since January.

And the cross-party coalition on these issues appears somewhat fragile.

State Rep. Craig Williams, a Republican from Delaware County in the Philadelphia suburbs, voted for both Solar for Schools and the community energy bill and said he believes there is a dire need to adjust state energy policy in the midst of rapidly rising costs.

“I’m trying to work across the aisle to get any form of generation online that’s clean and sustainable,” Williams said, adding he finds geothermal and nuclear particularly promising.

But Williams, a former PECO assistant general counsel, has also at times proved a thorn in the side of solar advocates, introducing amendments to legislation that they fear could negatively impact net metering, the way that owners of distributed solar panels receive financial compensation from utilities.

Williams said he thinks the current compensation system unfairly increases costs for non-solar owners, an issue utilities have also raised to state regulators. Solar advocates dispute that. Celentano said he’s pressed for evidence of such a cost shift, “and they can never show us the data.”

For Williams, discussions about advancing solar and community-generation policies are also part of an all-of-the-above strategy. He wants to see Democrats move off long-held positions against bringing new fossil fuel power plants online, citing concerns about power demand outstripping supply.

“There is a tremendous opportunity if we can get out of our own way,” Williams said.

What Next?

Numerous advocates said they believe Fiedler’s Solar for Schools program has benefited from a unique combination of her persistent efforts, fortunate timing and the non-controversial nature of saving school districts money. One former clean energy lobbyist, speaking on the condition of anonymity after taking a job with a public entity, said a one-off program with $25 million in the bank is more politically palatable than something with wider ramifications, like a community energy bill that could shift how electricity is generated and distributed in Pennsylvania.

“It’s a little bit of an easier selling point than saying, ‘Hey let’s create a whole new system of microgrids that the utilities see as an existential threat,’” the former lobbyist said, adding that he thinks supporters would be wise to focus on rising consumer costs. “I think that argument has not been made. And into that vacuum have come the utilities that quietly whispered in the ears of the Pennsylvania Senate to say, ‘Hey, this could hurt us.’”

The recent budget deal did little to boost hopes. Advocates note that a House vote on H.B. 501, the so-called PRESS bill that would elevate renewables in the state’s energy mix, has now been set for Monday, an apparent consolation prize to climate advocates upset about RGGI. But there’s no indication Senate Republican leadership will also bring it up in their chamber.

Similarly, the budget includes language that would clear the way for the state to use $156 million in federal “Solar for All” funding, which would install rooftop solar in low-income areas in Pennsylvania. But the fate of that Biden-era federal appropriation remains tied up in the court system after the Trump administration attempted to cancel it.

Sharon Pillar, executive director of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center, suggests that solar supporters may have better luck focusing not on the legislature but on the state Public Utility Commission, which has the power to draft new rules for utilities. In early November, the advocacy group Vote Solar launched a petitionasking the commission to require more transparency on utilities’ solar connection queues and also create “clear, enforceable timelines” for applications.

“If the state can fix those things—if they’re willing to—then we can be moving this forward without a lot of other action,” Pillar said.

In an email, PUC spokesperson Nils Hagen-Frederiksen said the commission has “not been made aware” of any backlogs for small-scale projects like residential rooftop solar, which he said are often given same-day, automatic approval for standard designs. But larger, more complex commercial arrays, he said , take more time to process given cost and safety consideration, along with an application rush ahead of federal incentive sunsets.

“The Commission continues to review interconnection-related issues statewide to ensure that the process remains timely, transparent, and fair for all customers,” Hagen-Frederiksen wrote.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/climate-change-pa-farmers-6-solar-panel-768x511.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:30.907868

Alaska LNG, a branch of the New York City and Anchorage-based Glenfarne energy company, and energy technology giant BakerHughes announced an alliance that will bring to reality and accelerate plans for a nearly 1,000-mile, 42-inch LNG pipeline down the middle of the Last Frontier, and a corresponding terminal on the Kenai peninsula.

The 807-mile pipeline is projected to begin near Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean and run down to Nikiski – a village halfway between Anchorage and Homer.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced the agreement, with Glenfarne CEO Brendan Duval saying that BakerHughes’ partnership on the project is a big deal due to the company’s expertise in LNG compression technology.

Duval said the deal reflects an increased momentum toward the mega-project’s future realization and praised the project’s ability to attract “global partners [in order] to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,” Wright said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

“Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum added that U.S. LNG is “not just an energy source [but] a strategic asset that powers our economy.”

Burgum, who chairs the National Energy Dominance Council, added that Glenfarne and BakerHughes working together will undoubtedly bear fruit in terms of new energy infrastructure that will create long-term affordable power for Americans that is based in America.

BakerHughes chairman Lorenzo Simonelli said in a statement that natural gas provides secure and reliable energy at an affordable rate to consumers. Simonelli also touted its lower carbon output than other fuels.

BURGUM, ZELDIN, WRIGHT: THIS IS HOW AMERICA WILL ACHIEVE ENERGY DOMINANCE

According to reports, the project will include a carbon-capture plant on Alaska’s remote North Slope that will have the capacity to remove seven million tons of carbon dioxide from the project annually.

Alaska’s energy potential has been repeatedly touted by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who previously told Fox News Digital he is interested in an all-of-the-above approach devoid of politics that instead focuses on what will work and what will keep energy jobs in Alaska and the U.S. writ large versus overseas.

Dunleavy and Alaska officials battled the Biden administration over what they called intentional roadblocks against natural resources exploration in places like Ambler and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s Section 1002; commonly dubbed ANWR.

As COP30 faces the reality of changing the global energy sector, five areas are worth watching: Carbon markets.
COP30 will refine carbon pricing, trading and nature-based offsets regulations to support investment in low-carbon supply or abatement solutions.
Given the track record of US participation in global climate initiatives, what can we expect from the US at COP30?
Leading hyperscalers have invested in zero carbon power technologies such as advanced nuclear power in 2025.","At the outset of the United Nations in 1945, US President Harry Truman acknowledged a global challenge ahead. “We all have to recognize – no matter how great our strength – that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please.” Truman was referring to prioritising problem-solving for the good of the world over national interests. And making climate change a priority for all countries will remain a challenge at the latest iteration of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP30.

Progress on lowering global carbon emissions is stubbornly slow. In our latest Energy Transition Outlook, the world is on a 2.6 °C emissions pathway, with the 1.5 °C pathway increasingly out of reach. Energy security and affordability, rather than climate, have risen to the top of the agenda for many countries around the world. Meanwhile, gas-fired power investment, primarily in the US, is surging, driven by AI.

New nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that are due at COP30 lack the ambition to meet the Paris climate accord goals. Protestors who tested COP30’s security earlier this week illustrate the challenge of managing multiple stakeholders, each with specific priorities.

With these issues on the table, COP30 has been billed as ‘the implementation COP’. This means it will develop existing climate policies, rather than announce a range of new goals. As COP30 faces the reality of changing the global energy sector, five areas are worth watching:

Carbon markets. COP30 will refine carbon pricing, trading and nature-based offsets regulations to support investment in low-carbon supply or abatement solutions.

China’s pledges. China will likely outperform its latest climate pledge to expand wind and solar capacity sixfold by 2035. Rather than its NDC, watch how fast China expands its low-carbon supply chain.

US policy. With the US out of the Paris Agreement for the second time, state-level policies, load growth and corporate policies will be the primary drivers of low-carbon investment in America.

Expanding biofuels. The Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels, known as Belém 4x, intends to quadruple the production and use of sustainable fuels, including hydrogen and its derivatives, biogases, biofuels and synthetic fuels, by 2035.

CBAM compliance. As Europe begins to scale its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), developing countries will likely seek longer phase-in periods and industry carve-outs to comply with carbon taxes over time.

For COP30, the absence of the US is the elephant in the room. As the world’s largest economy, second-largest carbon emitter and the largest oil and gas producer in the world, the US can influence the pace of low-carbon investment globally. Describing the Paris Agreement as an “unfair, one-sided rip-off”, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from it on his first day in office in 2025.

The US has an on-again, off-again relationship with global climate governance. President Bill Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, but the US Senate feared the Kyoto Protocol could “result in serious harm to the economy of the United States”, stopping Congressional ratification in its tracks. President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. Since 2015, the US has joined and exited the Paris Agreement twice.

Given the track record of US participation in global climate initiatives, what can we expect from the US at COP30?

The Wood Mackenzie view

Although the US is out of the Paris Agreement, it is still influencing global policy on climate change. For example, strong resistance from the US administration caused the International Maritime Organization to delay a vote on whether to adopt its Net Zero Framework. But while the US is out of the climate agreement now, it is not out of decarbonisation altogether. Far from it.

After the US election of President Trump in 2024, ExxonMobil urged the Trump administration to stay in the Paris Agreement to influence global carbon policy and international regulations that could impact US companies. According to a study from the UCLA Anderson School of Management, 57% of the S&P 500 companies have net zero and carbon neutrality goals. Leading hyperscalers have invested in zero carbon power technologies such as advanced nuclear power in 2025.

What is also clear is that the US power market will need renewables going forward. According to Patrick Huang, Senior Analyst, US power, “Our Lens Power platform shows that the combination of 2% to 3% per year demand growth, coal retirements and limits to natural gas-fired power means the US power grid requires several hundred gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity through 2035.”

Huang concludes: “Renewable power is still the lowest-cost option to meet power demand.”

At COP30, the leading voice for renewable power will be the US Climate Alliance, chaired by California Governor Gavin Newsom. The group’s 24 governors represent 57% of US GDP and 54% of its population, according to the group. The states within the alliance outpaced the national average in net emissions reductions by 8% between 2005 and 2023, according to its figures.

State-level policy remains critical to low-carbon investment in the transport sector. According to the California Air Resource Board, the state’s clean fuels standard supported US$4 billion in new investments in low- or zero-emissions transport technologies such as biodiesel, biogasoline and electric vehicles. Low-carbon fuel standards have expanded across the western US to include Washington, Oregon and New Mexico.

Federal government policy will no doubt change as a result of future presidential elections, but state-level autonomy remains a bedrock of the US energy sector. According to Lindsey Entwistle, coauthor of Wood Mackenzie’s Energy Transition Outlook, in our base case outlook between 2025 and 2060, US emissions fall by 60%. In our delayed transition scenario, which posits a slower investment pathway for low-carbon supply, emissions fall by 43% over the same time period.

In brief

‘The Art of the Deal’ for strategic sectors

In early November, Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies announced a US$1.4 billion private-public partnership with the US government and private investors. The partnership aims to build a new 10,000-metric tonne magnet production facility.

ReElement’s technology will recycle and refine rare-earth oxides, which Vulcan will then convert into completed high-performance magnets. While this announcement will not end China’s dominance in global rare earths production and supply, it is a step towards establishing a US-led supply chain.

This announcement reflects how the Trump administration approaches strategic sectors: moving beyond policy support, such as tax incentives, to partnering with specific companies via equity investing, profit sharing and loans. Key examples include the administration’s 10% equity stake in Intel, a 15% profit share of Nvidia chip sales to China and the potential for equity with Brookfield’s $80 billion investment announcement in US nuclear.

Tariffs are still likely despite Supreme Court review

The US Supreme Court is reviewing President Trump’s authority to impose trade tariffs, a major challenge to the president.

The Trump administration argues that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) empowers the executive branch to impose tariffs. The counterargument is that the US Constitution says tariffs are Congress’ domain unless it delegates the specific authority on tariffs to the president. According to initial reports, justices questioned the administration's argument that IEEPA's ambiguous power to “regulate” imports includes the authority to levy tariffs.

Regardless of what happens at the Supreme Court, the Trump administration has laid the groundwork for more Section 232 and 301 tariffs in the future. So far this year, the Trump administration has opened investigations that could lead to new or expanded tariffs for critical minerals, polysilicon, wind turbines and semiconductors.

Houston’s Power and Trading Conference

Wood Mackenzie presented our short-term power market analysis this week to break down how large loads are reshaping gas and power markets in the US. Rebekah Llamas, Principal Analyst, noted the scale of large loads, highlighting, for instance, Lake Mariner, a data centre in New York, which represents approximately 9% of NYISO Zone A demand.

One crucial question for power markets is how price-responsive large loads are. There is clear price-responsive behavior above US$100/MWh thresholds, with facilities reducing consumption during high-price periods and backfilling from onsite generation or storage resources. Looking at Tesla’s gigafactory in Texas, we are seeing a spike in electricity consumption ahead of congestion-driven price rises, according to Wood Mackenzie’s short-term power analysis.

Concentrated demand creates significant basis risk that must be actively managed. RTOs across the country will need to revise and update short-term load-planning methodologies to inform long-term investments. “Real-time visibility tools provide trading advantages for those who can detect unforecasted load ramps,” according to Llamas.

Wildcard of the week

Introducing a new occasional section in the Energy Pulse: the wildcard of the week. This is intended to identify a specific trend, announcement or investment that could impact the US energy sector in unanticipated ways. As we wrote about in last week’s Energy Pulse, a proposed rulemaking from the Department of Energy (DOE) could accelerate large load interconnections to the US grid.

The wildcard here will be the reaction from the power sector. According to Ben Hertz-Shargel, Director Grid Edge, greater Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction would be fought tooth and nail by states and utilities in the stakeholder process and then the courts. Further, the utility industry is likely to support FERC’s existing authorities over a federal takeover. Nevertheless, the real opportunity is for FERC and the states to take up the DOE's recommendations within existing jurisdictional limits.

If events go that way, we could see acceleration of large load co-location with generation and a host of new partnerships. Look out for industry comments to the DOE rulemaking from 21 November.

Quote of the week

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office… by far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants – to get those first plants built.” US Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright at the American Nuclear Society Conference on 10 November.

On the heels of the US$80 billion investment announcement in nuclear power last week, Secretary Wright highlighted the key role that the loan program office (LPO) will have in supporting new nuclear power investments – the DOE can redirect spending in line with the executive branch’s priorities. Nuclear power could receive a larger share of DOE grants or loans as the Trump administration shapes the LPO. The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act appropriated around US$400 billion to the LPO, according to external sources.

While much of the RNG industry’s focus recently (for good reason) has been on qualifying for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act or state tax credits under programs like California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, there has been less emphasis on the voluntary credit market for private parties. However, with the phase-out of many of these public tax credits, RNG project participants are taking a closer look at the voluntary market.

For project developers, investors, and other RNG project participants, this change creates measurable new opportunities. With animal-waste RNG now eligible, developers can tap into a broader feedstock base—accessing livestock operations, dairies, hog or poultry farms—to partner on biomethane projects and then certify under Green-e® to generate Renewable Fuel Certificates (RFCs) that carry third-party verification. This means additional revenue streams from voluntary markets, enhanced project marketability, and better off-take positioning for those seeking certified low-carbon fuel. Moreover, the inclusion of CAFO-based projects can make such developments more attractive to ESG-oriented investors who value not only carbon reductions but also traceability and independent verification of feedstock and emissions.

Certification under Green-e® now also means animal-waste-based RNG projects can benefit from enhanced reputational and risk-mitigation value. By complying with Appendix A, these projects demonstrate that they meet rigorous environmental and sustainability safeguards—such as community input, wildlife and water-quality protections—and strict feedstock definition for CAFOs. This third-party guardrail reduces investor risk around feedstock legitimacy or public-relations concerns (often associated with large animal operations) and allows developers to anchor a certification label in their marketing and contracting. In turn, investors may view certified RNG from animal waste as lower-risk and more bankable, especially when paired with offtake contracts or voluntary-buyer portfolios requiring certified credentials.

Although the future of financial incentives for RNG projects on the public side is a little more uncertain and subject to some growing pains in the near term, the development of the voluntary credit market for these projects is a welcome relief.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15872_4946.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:58.659477

The proposed changes are largely intended to reduce reporting obligations, exempting from reporting finished goods imports (referred to as “imported articles” under TSCA), de minimis uses of PFAS, and certain PFAS considered manufacturing byproducts or chemical impurities.

The proposed changes will proceed to public comment and could become effective as soon as early 2026. The reporting window is expected to be available to regulated entities in the middle of 2026, opening 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and closing after three months.

In addition to the proposed exemptions, EPA has published updates to the TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule website, a Frequently Asked Questions document, an Instructions for Reporting document, and a press release discussing the proposed rule that may assist businesses in understanding the scope of and rationale for these new exemptions.

EPA’s Six Proposed Exemptions

EPA is proposing six specific exemptions to the TSCA PFAS reporting rule, with the goal of providing “both regulatory relief and greater regulatory certainty to regulated parties, resulting in a net reduction in cost while retaining the majority of PFAS manufacture reporting requirements.” The six currently proposed exemptions are as follows:

Imported Articles. EPA intends to exempt imported articles from reporting, noting that “importing PFAS in articles between 2011-2022 is an activity about which manufacturers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information.”

De Minimis Exemption of 0.1%. Reporting would not be required for PFAS in mixtures or products at concentrations of 0.1% or lower. This low-concentration exemption would apply regardless of the total production volume of the mixture or article.

Certain Byproducts. Byproducts are chemical substances produced during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance. EPA is proposing to exempt “any byproduct not used for commercial purposes.”

Certain Impurities. Impurities are chemical substances unintentionally present within another chemical substance. EPA would not require reporting as to PFAS impurities, which have “no distinct commercial purpose apart from the substance, mixture, or article in which they are contained.”

Research and Development (“R&D”). EPA proposes to exclude reporting related to PFAS manufactured or imported when done so only for R&D purposes.

Non-Isolated Intermediates. EPA proposes an exemption for non-isolated intermediates because these substances usually remain in a closed system and therefore “do not result in meaningful human or environmental exposure.”

No exemptions specifically for small manufacturers are contemplated, although some of these proposed exemptions may apply to many small manufacturers.

What Aspects of the Reporting Rule Remain the Same?

EPA has left many of the key aspects of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule unchanged, including the following:

Due Diligence Standard: A reporting entity is still expected to report information that is known to the entity or reasonably ascertainable by the entity.

Definition of PFAS:

The broad definition of PFAS under the rule remains the same: “Any chemical substance or mixture containing a chemical substance that structurally contains at least one of the following three sub-structures:

R-(CF2)-CF(R′)R″, where both the CF2 and CF moieties are saturated carbons;

R-CF2OCF2-R′, where R and R′ can either be F, O, or saturated carbons;

CF3C(CF3)R′R″, where R′ and R″ can either be F or saturated carbons.”

Lookback Period: The relevant reporting lookback period remains the 11 years between January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2022.

Confidential Business Information & Joint Submissions: Requirements for claiming confidential business information, as well as options to complete joint submissions with suppliers or vendors, remain the same.

Data Required for Submission: Where reporting is required under EPA’s proposed rule, the information required to be reported remains the same. (See BCLP’s Insight on the original TSCA PFAS reporting rule for further details on the substantive reporting requirements.) The following information must be reported:

Company and facility information;

Chemical-specific information, including chemical identity and molecular structure;

Information on industrial processing and use (what industries use the reported chemical and for what purposes);

Information on consumer and commercial use (who uses the reported chemical downstream and for what purposes);

Quantities of each reported chemical manufactured, produced, or imported for each calendar year from 2011 to 2022;

""All existing information concerning the environmental and health effects” of the reported PFAS chemicals in the company’s possession or control, which is not limited to information published since 2011;

Information regarding worker exposure for the reported chemicals, including the number of individuals exposed, activities performed by the workers, and exposure scenarios and duration; and

Information regarding disposal of the reported PFAS chemicals, including amounts and disposal methods.

Next Steps for Reporting Entities

Public comments are due on the proposed rule 45 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register. The rule would likely be finalized in early 2026, with the reporting window set to open 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and remaining open for three months. This submission period may be shorter than the current reporting window, set to close on October 13, 2026, as EPA has indicated it believes that “reporters have had adequate time to consider how they intend to comply with the rule.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15569_1953.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 14:01:29.790936

Click here to read Governor Stein’s and Commissioner Causey’s letter in support of H.R.","Today Governor Josh Stein and Commissioner of Insurance Mike Causey called on Congress to pass H.R. 3161, the Preventing Environmental Hazards Act of 2025, a bill co-introduced by Congressman Greg Murphy (NC-03). H.R. 3161 would create more proactive support for coastal homeowners whose homes are at risk of collapse. In recent weeks, severe weather events have caused homes in Buxton and Rodanthe to collapse into the ocean.

“Since 2020, 27 oceanfront houses have collapsed into the ocean on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, including 16 houses just since this September. When these houses collapse, it isn’t just a tragedy for the homeowners. The destroyed houses also spread debris for miles and risk people’s safety on our beaches,” said Governor Stein and Commissioner Causey. “We respectfully urge the House Financial Services Committee to advance and Congress to pass H.R. 3161. The State stands ready to work with you to protect coastal communities, taxpayers, and our treasured Outer Banks.”

The implementation of H.R. 3161 would help North Carolina move from a stance of after-the-fact cleanup to proactive relocation or removal of oceanfront structures that are under threat. The bipartisan bill would authorize the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to offer pre-collapse coverage so that homeowners could demolish or relocate condemned structures before they fall into the ocean. This recommendation aligns with a key idea from a joint report by the National Park Service (NPS) and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) that was released in August 2024.

Leopold, Ashley T.K. Phillips, Jason A. Hill",,,,,https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/11/texas-granted-primacy-over-class-vi-wells,"Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state.
Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota.
The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards.
Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S.
With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Nov. 12, 2025, announced a final rule granting the State of Texas primary implementation and enforcement authority (also known as primacy) for Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signed the pre-publication version of the final rule on behalf of the agency.

This important decision supports cooperative federalism goals by transferring the sole authority for permitting wells used for geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration from the EPA to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC). Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state. Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota. The final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, which is expected at any time.

As analyzed in Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""The Path to Class VI Primacy in Texas: MOA Reveals State and Federal Review,"" the EPA and RRC established a memorandum of agreement detailing how application reviews would be coordinated during the transition, as well as how EPA will provide oversight to the RRC. The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards. Accordingly, the EPA will maintain a seat beside the RRC in a role of programmatic review.

Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S. This grant of primacy to the RRC is anticipated to reduce ""red tape"" and delays associated with federal EPA review, which can take years to complete following an already lengthy application process due to the engineering and geologic complexity of Class VI UIC wells and the CCS projects they support.

Unlike other similar agencies in other states, the RRC seems uniquely well positioned to follow through on this promise, as it can leverage its extensive experience in permitting other wells (including all types of UIC wells) and deep staff experience to provide a more efficient and predictable regulatory framework. As of Nov. 12, 2025, the RRC has 18 applicants currently under review and anticipates additional applications in the coming weeks. In its accompanying press release, the RRC remains laser focused in support its new Class VI UIC program, noting that primacy will ""provide certainty for energy companies looking to invest in CCS development.""

Next Steps

For energy companies and investors in the CCS space, this development presents a significant opportunity, given Texas' favorable geologic conditions. If CCS projects can be supported by a streamlined and predictable permitting timeline, project risk can be reduced, thereby supporting viability. Companies now have multiple opportunities to ensure that these new primacy considerations are embedded into and support their CCS projects in Texas. Those planning projects should consider engaging with counsel to understand the nuances of the new RRC-specific requirements, as well as help navigate any subsequent challenges to the Texas primacy rule. Similarly, those already holding federal Class VI UIC permits should consider risks and opportunities associated with the process of transfer from EPA to RRC jurisdiction.

In addition, companies should consider the benefits of engaging in the RRC's process at the earliest feasible date to ensure that permit applications receive the most favorable slot in the queue for RRC review. With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.

In an attempt to blunt that earlier criticism, Toyota promised in 2017 to invest $13 billion in U.S. manufacturing.
Toyota has four lines currently producing batteries for hybrids, which at full capacity can supply up to 600,000 gas-electric vehicles.
“With the regulation changes, it’s changed a little bit,” Don Stewart, president of the battery plant, told reporters.
Demand for EVs is expected to soften, and BloombergNEF now forecasts a major surplus in U.S. battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030.","Toyota Motor Corp. confirmed it will plow as much as $10 billion into the U.S. over the next five years to boost its local operations, less than a month after President Trump flagged that the Japanese carmaker planned such an investment.

The announcement clears up a confusing moment from Trump’s visit to Tokyo last month, when he said Toyota would build plants all over the U.S. “to the tune of over $10 billion.” At the time, the automaker wouldn’t confirm such a plan, calling it mere speculation.

The automaker provided no further details on how it will spend the funds. David Christ, Toyota’s U.S. sales chief, said that will be revealed at a later date.

“We’ll announce the investment plans for the $10 billion as we get closer to making the investments,” Christ told reporters Wednesday at a ceremony for a new battery plant in North Carolina.

The investment announcement comes as the Trump administration pressures the global auto industry to shift more production to the U.S. and imposed punitive tariffs on many car parts and vehicles sourced from abroad.

Toyota’s top executive in the U.S., Ted Ogawa, said the battery plant and new investment “marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history.”

The president called out Toyota by name earlier this year for importing too many vehicles from Japan to the U.S., and also singled it out during this first administration for building up manufacturing operations in Mexico.

In an attempt to blunt that earlier criticism, Toyota promised in 2017 to invest $13 billion in U.S. manufacturing. The company said earlier this year that it had spent those funds and that its total investment in the U.S. currently exceeds $50 billion — spread over nearly seven decades.

The Japanese company imported about half of the vehicles it sold in the U.S. last year, mostly from Canada and Mexico but also including some 281,000 vehicles made in Japan.

The latest investment commitment was timed to coincide with the official opening of Toyota’s newest plant, a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility located near Greensboro, N.C.

Construction of the factory in the rural town of Liberty cost $13.9 billion and production is expected to slowly ramp up over the next decade. Toyota said it will create 5,100 new jobs and supply both hybrid gas-electric and all-electric models.

Swift about-face

When Toyota first announced the U.S. battery plant project in 2021, it envisioned a steady rise in Americans’ demand for EVs due in part to then-President Biden’s efforts to speed adoption of zero-emission vehicles with favorable policies.

Trump’s return to the White House has led to a swift about-face in federal emissions regulations, including the abandonment of incentives for EV buyers such as a $7,500 tax credit.

Toyota has four lines currently producing batteries for hybrids, which at full capacity can supply up to 600,000 gas-electric vehicles. Those will be installed in models such as the Camry mid-size sedan and hybrid versions of the Corolla Cross crossover and best-selling RAV4 compact SUV.

Three more lines will be added next year, one dedicated to batteries for 45,000 all-electric vehicles a year and two that can make batteries for an additional 74,000 fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, Anne Souder, a plant general manager, told reporters at a briefing.

The carmaker aims for a total of 14 lines to be operational by 2034, but its decision to scale back ambitious plans to sell as many as seven EV models in the U.S. has injected uncertainty into Toyota’s plans for production of all-electric vehicle batteries.

“With the regulation changes, it’s changed a little bit,” Don Stewart, president of the battery plant, told reporters.

Demand for EVs is expected to soften, and BloombergNEF now forecasts a major surplus in U.S. battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030. That’s largely due to a 14-million-unit downward revision in projected U.S. sales of EVs by then.

The carmaker delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric vehicles in the U.S. in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics have skyrocketed.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c92b5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+212/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F14%2F597726e24ddb91692cf7e6754410%2F531925-me-new-cars-13-rcg.JPG,N,,2025-11-14 14:02:35.750610

Consumers simply seem a lot more interested in electric sedans and SUVs than electric trucks.
Even with sales supercharged as consumers raced to tap expiring EV tax credits, Americans purchased just about 60,000 electric pickup trucks through the third quarter of this year, but bought more than 900,000 electric SUVs, sedans, and sports cars.
But there might be a path forward for the electric truck yet, says Art Wheaton, an expert on transportation industries at Cornell University: small and cheap.
“Changing policies, lower demand, and higher costs have made electric trucks a harder sell,” he said.","This analysis and news roundup comes from the Canary Media Weekly newsletter. Sign up to get it every Friday.

Back in May of 2021, Ford’s F-150 Lightning debuted with star-spangled flair. Then-President Joe Biden visited Ford’s sparkling new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan, where the company displayed the truck in front of a giant American flag alongside its gas-powered siblings. And after declaring that ​“the future of the auto industry is electric,” Biden even took the Lightning for a zippy test drive.

The picture is decidedly less bright today. A factory fire has forced Ford to pause production of the groundbreaking truck — and The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is considering halting production of the Lightning altogether after years of sluggish sales.

It’s not just the Lightning that has stalled. Electric trucks as a category have sputtered, largely due to their cost. A standard gas-powered F-150 starts at just shy of $40,000, while a Lightning with the lowest trim package starts at $55,000. Charging at home can help EV drivers recoup that cost difference, but it’s hard to ignore the initial sticker shock — especially given that federal EV incentives are now dead under President Donald Trump’s July budget law.

Politics may also be to blame. While the gas-powered Ford F-150 is among the most popular vehicles in counties that voted for Trump in 2020, the president’s repeated railing against EVs, coupled with Biden’s early endorsement, has put electric cars at the center of America’s polarized politics.

Still, even the Cybertruck, which carries a very different political connotation, isn’t doing so hot. Tesla sold just under 40,000 Cybertrucks last year in the U.S., while Ford sold about 33,500 Lightnings.

Consumers simply seem a lot more interested in electric sedans and SUVs than electric trucks. Even with sales supercharged as consumers raced to tap expiring EV tax credits, Americans purchased just about 60,000 electric pickup trucks through the third quarter of this year, but bought more than 900,000 electric SUVs, sedans, and sports cars.

But there might be a path forward for the electric truck yet, says Art Wheaton, an expert on transportation industries at Cornell University: small and cheap.

“Changing policies, lower demand, and higher costs have made electric trucks a harder sell,” he said. ​“Canceling the Lightning and replacing with a much lower-cost, smaller electric truck makes long-term sense given the current policies towards electric vehicles.”

More big energy stories

A tale of two gas bans

Massachusetts and New York may be neighbors, but they’re seemingly heading in different directions when it comes to transitioning their buildings off of fossil fuels.

Back in 2022, Massachusetts created a pilot program that let 10 municipalities prohibit fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings and major renovations. Advocates tell Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus that the program is already lowering energy bills and reducing emissions — and lawmakers are considering new legislation to bring another 10 cities and towns into the fold.

New York has also made big commitments to clean up its buildings, including enacting rules this summer that would require all-electric appliances in most new construction. But last week, 19 Democratic state lawmakers sent a letter to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul urging her to postpone implementation of the All-Electric Buildings Act. And on Wednesday, the state agreed, pausing the rules from taking effect at the end of this year.

COP30 kicks off with a focus on climate resilience

Leaders and advocates from around the world gathered in Brazil this week for the beginning of the United Nations’ COP30 climate summit. The Trump administration didn’t send a formal delegation, but that was OK with many diplomats — and with California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the president a ​“wrecking ball” to climate action during one panel.

Digs at the U.S. were aplenty during the first days of the conference, as were discussions of the need to ramp up climate adaptation and resilience work as extreme weather events grow more frequent and more intense. Jamaica, for example, is facing as much as $7 billion in damages — a third of its gross domestic product — in the wake of last month’s Hurricane Melissa. But in the storm’s aftermath, Jamaica has also shown how resilience efforts pay off. The island has deployed more than 60 megawatts of rooftop solar power since 2015, and many solar-equipped homes became neighborhood hubs in the wake of Melissa’s destruction.

The program matches the pricing of GMP’s existing Tesla Powerwall lease program, which charges the same $55 monthly rate, according to GMP’s tariff filing.
According to documentation from GMP, this network has saved GMP customers up to $3 million annually in recent years.
According to research from Rocky Mountain Institute, this reduces costs for all of GMP’s 265,000+ customers, not just those hosting batteries.
By matching Tesla’s $55 monthly price in GMP’s program, Enphase achieves price parity with a major competitor in what Vermont regulators have called a pioneering utility battery program.","On November 12, 2025, Enphase Energy and Green Mountain Power announced an expanded partnership that adds Enphase battery systems to GMP’s existing home energy storage lease program. The announcement, which was distributed as a corporate press release, presents the program as offering Vermont customers “true energy independence.” However, a detailed examination of the program’s structure reveals significant details that were not included in the announcement—particularly regarding when homeowners can actually use their batteries and what the true costs are.

What the Program Offers

According to GMP’s program page and the official press release, eligible customers can lease two Enphase IQ Battery 10C units through one of two payment options:

Monthly payments of $55 for 120 months (10 years)

A one-time upfront payment of $5,500

The two-battery system provides 20 kilowatt-hours of storage capacity and comes with a 15-year warranty, according to Solar Power World. This configuration is generally capable of powering an entire home, including high-demand appliances like HVAC systems and water pumps, according to technical specifications from Wolf River Electric.

The program matches the pricing of GMP’s existing Tesla Powerwall lease program, which charges the same $55 monthly rate, according to GMP’s tariff filing.

The Installation Cost Omission

The announcement’s “$5,500 one-time cost” figure does not represent the total amount customers will pay. According to an analysis by SolarReviews, homeowners must separately pay for installation of the batteries, which brings the total cost over the lease term to between $7,500 and $10,000.

This means customers choosing the upfront payment option should expect to pay between $7,500 and $10,000 in total—the $5,500 lease payment plus an estimated $2,000 to $4,500 for installation. The press release and program materials do not prominently disclose this additional mandatory cost.

The Critical Usage Restriction

The most significant detail omitted from the announcement concerns when and how homeowners can actually use their leased batteries. According to SolarReviews’ explanation of the program: “While homeowners can only use the batteries in the event of a power outage, Green Mountain Power can use as much of the energy stored in the batteries as they want, at any time.”

This restriction is formalized in GMP’s Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program terms, which specify that customers “may not use the battery system for any controls other than providing backup power for the customer’s premises.”

In practical terms, this means:

What homeowners CAN do: Use the battery for backup power during grid outages

What homeowners CANNOT do: Use the battery to reduce their electric bills by shifting energy use to off-peak hours, storing solar energy for evening use, or any other purpose when the grid is functioning normally

GMP maintains operational control of the batteries at all times except during outages, using them as part of its 75-megawatt Virtual Power Plant, according to the press release.

How the Virtual Power Plant Works

The leased batteries become part of what the announcement describes as “the largest dispatchable energy resource in Vermont”—GMP’s 75-megawatt Virtual Power Plant. According to documentation from GMP, this network has saved GMP customers up to $3 million annually in recent years.

The savings mechanism works like this: GMP remotely controls thousands of distributed battery systems across its service territory. During periods of high electricity demand, when wholesale power prices spike, GMP discharges these batteries instead of purchasing expensive power from the regional grid. According to research from Rocky Mountain Institute, this reduces costs for all of GMP’s 265,000+ customers, not just those hosting batteries.

In exchange for ceding control of their batteries, lease participants receive the discounted equipment price. The broader customer base benefits from the $3 million in annual system-wide savings.

The Federal Subsidy Structure

The low pricing of the program is made possible by the 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), though this is not mentioned in the announcement. Under the lease model, GMP—as the system owner—claims this federal tax credit rather than the homeowner, according to Utility Dive’s reporting on GMP’s battery programs.

According to that report, GMP’s actual cost for similar battery systems had risen to approximately $22,000, but the utility maintained the $55 monthly customer price specifically because “the federal Inflation Reduction Act provides a 30% investment tax credit for the systems.”

This means the federal government is effectively subsidizing roughly $6,600 of each system’s cost through the tax credit, which GMP captures and uses to offer the reduced lease price to customers.

The timing is significant: according to guidance from Enphase, the 30% ITC for homeowner-purchased systems is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. However, lease and power purchase agreement models—like GMP’s program—remain eligible for the credit beyond that date.

The Value Proposition: What Customers Trade

To understand what customers give up in exchange for the discounted price, it’s useful to compare the lease cost to retail purchase prices.

Based on pricing data from renewable energy suppliers, two Enphase IQ Battery 10C units cost approximately $13,000-$13,200 at retail. Additional required equipment (controllers, combiners, etc.) adds roughly $2,000-$3,000. Professional installation and permitting typically costs $8,000-$9,000, based on cost discussions in solar industry forums.

This brings the total retail installed cost to approximately $23,000-$25,000—roughly 2.5 to 3 times the GMP lease program’s upfront price of $7,500-$10,000.

In exchange for this substantial discount, customers provide GMP with:

Operational control: The utility can dispatch the battery’s stored energy whenever it determines there is grid need

The federal tax credit: Worth approximately $6,600, which GMP claims instead of the homeowner

Equipment ownership: GMP owns the equipment; the customer cannot take it if they move (unless they buy out the lease)

Customers who purchase battery systems outright retain full control over when and how to use their stored energy, own the equipment, and can claim federal tax credits themselves (if purchased before the credit’s expiration).

Strategic Context: Enphase and Market Competition

While the announcement frames the partnership as primarily benefiting Vermont customers, it also represents a significant competitive and financial development for Enphase Energy.

Enphase is the dominant supplier of solar microinverters but faces stronger competition in the home battery market. According to analysis from TradingView, the company’s stock price has declined approximately 58% over the past year amid challenging market conditions.

By matching Tesla’s $55 monthly price in GMP’s program, Enphase achieves price parity with a major competitor in what Vermont regulators have called a pioneering utility battery program. The announcement generated positive stock market response, with Benzinga reporting that Enphase shares traded higher following the news.

According to Enphase’s Q2 2025 earnings materials, the company “anticipates a shift in the U.S. solar market towards lease/PPA models.” This GMP partnership validates that strategic direction by demonstrating a scalable utility partnership model.

Program Evolution and Pricing Changes

Evidence suggests this announcement represents an expansion and price reduction from an earlier pilot program. A separate GMP announcement regarding Enphase battery options referenced pricing of $65 per month or $6,500 upfront. The current program’s $55/$5,500 pricing appears to represent both an expansion in scale and a price reduction to match the Tesla Powerwall program terms.

What Happens Next

Vermont homeowners interested in the program can enroll through GMP’s designated program page. According to the enrollment process described by Enphase, approved installers handle the lease agreement, installation, and system setup.

Customers considering the program should:

Request total cost estimates that include both the lease payment and installation costs before committing

Understand the usage restrictions—batteries can only be used for backup during outages, not for bill reduction during normal grid operation

Recognize the trade-off—a substantial discount in exchange for ceding battery control to the utility

Consider their backup power needs—whether whole-home backup during increasingly severe storms justifies the cost and control limitations

Compare to purchasing—especially if interested in using stored energy for purposes beyond emergency backup

For customers primarily interested in backup power during outages and willing to allow utility control during normal operations, the program offers professionally installed, warrantied battery systems at prices significantly below retail purchase costs.

For customers interested in energy independence, time-of-use bill management, or maximizing their own solar energy use, the program’s restrictions may limit its appeal. These customers might consider purchasing battery systems outright (before the federal tax credit’s December 31, 2025 expiration) or waiting to see how battery programs evolve.

GMP and Enphase have announced that additional products, including a bidirectional EV charger expected in 2026, will be integrated into the partnership in the future, according to the press release.

The program represents Vermont’s continued experimentation with virtual power plant models—using networks of distributed residential batteries to provide grid services while offering homeowners backup power at subsidized prices. Whether this model serves customer interests depends largely on individual circumstances and priorities regarding cost, control, and the value of backup power.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!30zh!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0ea1e49-8c61-4333-8c4c-3caa45460129_1148x750.png",N,,2025-11-14 16:02:25.441517

NMG is a North American mining company positioning itself to be the first fully integrated, carbon-neutral producer of natural graphite. Natural graphite is considered a critical mineral - given its necessity for everything from energy storage to electric vehicles - and can be found in many industries, including energy, technology, defense and manufacturing.

With China dominating mining and production of graphite, the Western world is forming alliances to protect supply, and NMG is benefiting from that. “Graphite goes into about fifteen applications and we were focused on the EV market, which is arguably the biggest demand and the biggest volumes. We demonstrated we can build a full vertical,” Desaulniers told Benzinga during the interview. “Now we intend to do the same thing in other markets.”

NMG is seeing a lot of interest from G7 and NATO countries that are looking for a producer outside of China, so much so that it was able to sign four off-take agreements at a recent G7 meeting.

“Great agreements, that’s what you need when you are building a project,” said the CEO. “You need certainty and partners, and that’s what we have delivered for our shareholders.”

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-14 17:33:55+00:00,The Seattle Times,"Future of clean energy and salmon depends on collaboration, not courts | The Seattle Times","Peter DeFazio, Norm Dicks",,,,,https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/future-of-clean-energy-and-salmon-depends-on-collaboration-not-courts/,"Hydropower remains the beating heart of our region’s clean energy system, providing reliable, carbon-free electricity to millions of homes and businesses.
Today, we face a challenge that demands the same spirit of collaboration and balance: how to ensure salmon and a strong hydropower system can share healthy rivers.
Billions of dollars of electric customer investments in science-driven habitat restoration and fish passage, and partnership with federal, state and tribal governments are leading to meaningful results for fish, clean energy and communities.
Hydropower is a cornerstone of the Northwest’s clean energy future.
Northwest families, workers and communities want leaders who can protect salmon and keep energy affordable.","When President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the Bonneville Dam in 1937, he called it a “yardstick for the future” — a promise that the Pacific Northwest could generate clean, affordable power for all. Nearly nine decades later, that promise endures. Hydropower remains the beating heart of our region’s clean energy system, providing reliable, carbon-free electricity to millions of homes and businesses.

It’s a legacy rooted in bipartisan support. Presidents, governors, and leaders of both parties have long recognized that hydropower is essential to the Northwest’s prosperity and remains the foundation of state climate policies. During our time in Congress, we were part of a bipartisan coalition strongly committed to policies and public investment to protect and grow our cherished salmon populations while supporting hydropower.

Today, we face a challenge that demands the same spirit of collaboration and balance: how to ensure salmon and a strong hydropower system can share healthy rivers. That challenge should be met through thoughtful, inclusive dialogue that brings our region together.

We’re making progress. Billions of dollars of electric customer investments in science-driven habitat restoration and fish passage, and partnership with federal, state and tribal governments are leading to meaningful results for fish, clean energy and communities. Salmon and steelhead returns are increasing. We need to continue to learn and build on our successes.

As former members of Congress representing Washington and Oregon, we’ve seen firsthand that lasting solutions emerge when states, tribes, farmers, utilities and conservationists work together. Yet despite clear progress, the conversation around salmon recovery has too often turned to litigation or decision-making behind closed doors rather than collaboration.

Having spent decades working in Pacific Northwest politics and policy, we know that fighting is sometimes the only option. Now is not that time.

As we confront the challenges of climate change and the energy transition required to address it, fractured decision-making wastes time, erodes trust and jeopardizes the future of this vital system that millions of people depend on every day.

Instead of channeling energy into lawsuits, we’re calling on Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and other leaders to channel their energies into pragmatic partnership rooted in science and progressive values.

Hydropower is a cornerstone of the Northwest’s clean energy future. As our states strive to meet ambitious climate goals while serving dramatically increasing electric usage, we cannot afford to sideline the single largest source of renewable energy in our region. At the same time, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to healthy salmon runs — vital to tribal cultures, commercial and recreational fisheries and the ecological fabric of the Pacific Northwest.

Fortunately, this is not a zero-sum choice. Modern technologies and collaborative management are proving that we can support both fish populations and reliable, affordable hydropower. State-of-the-art fish passage technologies, science-driven hatchery programs and habitat restoration projects are yielding measurable results. We have more work to do together. Continued innovation and cooperation, not conflict, will drive the next chapter of progress.

We urge the governors of Washington and Oregon to lead together in that spirit, set aside costly litigation and instead convene an inclusive forum for science-based public policy and innovative solutions that address today’s realities. This governance will build on decades of progress, help mitigate rising electricity costs and ensure the Columbia Basin remains a vital, connected landscape for all who depend on it.

Northwest families, workers and communities want leaders who can protect salmon and keep energy affordable. Endless litigation does neither. This moment calls for courage — the courage to unite rather than divide and to act not out of ideology but out of responsibility to future generations.

President Roosevelt envisioned a public power system that would empower the people of the Northwest for decades to come. Today, that vision depends on leaders willing to honor both the power of the river and the life within it. The salmon and the people of our region deserve nothing less.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11132025_tzr_tzr_114431.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-11-14 13:00:41.570175

Dive Brief:

Shell has agreed to sell “a substantial portion” of its Volta electric vehicle charging network to Australian charger manufacturer Jolt, according to an announcement this week.

The deal includes thousands of media-enabled EV chargers affiliated with the Volta Media advertising network across 34 states. In separate statements to C-Store Dive, Jolt CEO Doug McNamee and a Shell spokesperson both said the final numbers won’t be available until the deal closes since both parties are in discussions with site hosts. The acquisition is expected to close on Jan. 1, 2026, according to the announcement.

Shell is selling most of Volta less than three years after acquiring the charging company for $169 million in a move that aimed to scale the oil giant’s EV capabilities in the U.S.

Dive Insight:

Shell made waves when it bought Volta in early 2023. Volta’s chargers feature large-format digital advertising screens and the company’s proprietary PredictEV platform, which uses behavioral science and machine learning to help commercial property owners, cities and electric utilities plan EV infrastructure.

However, in early 2024, Shell notified Volta’s leadership that it was winding down its operations, with Shell taking over operations internally, and that the majority of its roughly 200 team members would be let go. In a statement this week, Shell’s spokesperson said that move was part of the integration between the two companies, which led to Volta’s assets being rebranded into the Shell Recharge program. However, Shell retained the Volta Media network name for advertising purposes, the spokesperson added.

The latest deal aims to build on Jolt’s model of combining digital out-of-home advertising displays with EV charging, according to the announcement.

First Solar selects South Carolina for new US production facility

Cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) module maker First Solar Inc of Tempe, AZ, USA is to establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the company’s international fleet. The firm expects to spend about $330m to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to begin commercial operation in second-half 2026. The facility is forecasted to create more than 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

First Solar says that the South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce US-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7GW, reaching 17.7GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives,” says First Solar’s CEO Mark Widmar.

First Solar's investment in Cherokee County will “greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence,” notes South Carolina’s Governor Henry McMaster.

The onshored processes will transform thin-film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands the firm’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and R&D footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, First Solar, which expects to directly employ over 5500 people in the USA by the end of 2026, will have invested about $4.5bn in US-based manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the USA since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company and the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the USA. By 2027, the firm expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3bn in labor income.

Fewer solar developers reported delays in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, the Energy Information Administration said in a Monday report.

In the third quarter this year, “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in the same period in 2024,” EIA said.

“Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions,” EIA said. Developers added around 31 GW of utility-scale solar capacity last year, though their projections at the beginning of the year forecasted 36 GW in additions.

“Because survey respondents may not anticipate the occurrence or duration of delays, ultimate capacity additions tend to be less than the expected amount that developers report to us at the beginning of the year,” EIA said. The agency said in February that it predicts 32.5 GW of utility-scale solar will be added this year, indicating that less solar may come online this year than last year, despite the decrease in delays.

EIA also noted that delays are more common than cancellations, and “less than 1% of planned solar capacity is entirely cancelled in a typical month … Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two.”

Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email that it’s “important to note that most of the solar capacity that has come online this year began construction last year.”

“The vast majority of what began construction this year received permits prior to July of this year, when the memo from the Department of the Interior slowing permitting was released,” Baca said. “As such, this data does not yet reflect the recent permitting obstruction, including from the DOI memo.

IN THE NEWS

President Donald J. Trump signed a narrow spending package to end the 43-day government shutdown, allowing federal agencies to begin reopening after the longest lapse of government funding in U.S. history. The bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives 222–209 after a group of Democratic congressmembers broke with their party to advance it, funds the government through January, reverses recent federal worker layoffs, and guarantees back pay for furloughed employees. The package omits Democrats’ priority of extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, prompting a separate vote over health-care subsidies in mid-December.

​​The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging its 2015 legalization of gay marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges. In Obergefell, the court held that marriage is a fundamental right that states cannot deny to couples on the basis of their same-sex partnership. In the denied case, a Kentucky county clerk sought relief from fines she received after refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Some observers thought the Court might overturn Obergefell, after it overturned the right to abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which Justice Thomas called in his concurrence for a reconsideration of Obergefell. This denial, however, leaves Obergefell intact.

A federal judge ordered the release of hundreds of immigrants detained during the Trump administration’s Chicago-area raids, “Operation Midway Blitz.” U.S. District Judge Jeffrey I. Cummings directed the U.S. Department of Justice to identify by November 19 which of the more than 600 immigrants remain in custody, and he barred officials from pressuring detainees into voluntary deportation. The ruling, issued amid allegations that federal agents conducted warrantless arrests in violation of a 2022 order, could lead to hundreds more releases as courts review the raids’ legality.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) may lose funding after the Trump Administration announced that, under its new legal interpretation, the CFPB’s current funding source is unlawful. The Administration declared in a memorandum that the CFPB’s funding, which comes from the “combined earnings of the federal reserve system,” means only profits—so when, as in recent years, the system operates at a loss, the CFPB cannot receive funding. The National Treasury Employees Union revealed the memorandum as part of its ongoing lawsuit to prevent “the Executive Branch’s ongoing effort to dismantle the CFPB.”

The Trump Administration is preparing to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling off the California coast for the first time in roughly four decades, per a draft U.S. Department of the Interior map. Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) said the proposal would be “dead on arrival” in California. The proposal would schedule six lease sales between 2027 and 2030 and expand drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, though it is unclear how much interest companies have in California waters after decades of limited activity.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lowering reporting requirements for manufacturers or importers of products containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which can take hundreds to thousands of years to break down in the environment. The current rule requires companies to report data to EPA related to PFAS exposure and any existing environmental and health effects. The proposed change would exempt companies producing compounds containing less than 0.1 percent of PFAS from the reporting requirement. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the proposed rule would decrease compliance burdens.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it will remove the “black box” warning label—the most severe safety label FDA places on prescription drugs—from hormone therapy drugs, which are used to treat menopause. The label was added after a study found that the drugs increased several health risks including breast cancer, strokes, and dementia. Another study released before the FDA announcement, however, indicated the benefits of hormone therapy drugs in treating menopause as long as patients did not have certain health conditions. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that an internal panel reviewed the latest scientific studies and recommended the warning’s removal.

The U.S. Supreme Court extended its previous order blocking full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program(SNAP) benefits for the month of November until 11:59 p.m. on November 13. The Court’s initial order paused a lower court ruling that required the Trump Administration to distribute SNAP payments using congressionally appropriated contingency funds while the federal government was shut down. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated that she would not have extended the order pausing benefits. In the meantime, several states implemented stopgap measures to cover SNAP benefits while federal funds were on hold.

WHAT WE’RE READING THIS WEEK

A recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined how the U.S. Department of Energy is investigating the current and past use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at its sites for purposes such as firefighting and uranium enrichment. PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” can remain in the environment for hundreds or thousands of years and cause health problems such as cancer and infertility. GAO found that since the Energy Department announced its intention to survey PFAS contamination at 57 sites in 2022, it had not finished reviewing over half of them, and over 100 other sites were not surveyed at all. GAO observed that the lack of completed site reviews means that the Energy Department will not know the extent of its PFAS contamination or where it poses health risks. As a result, GAO concluded that the Energy Department is not currently able to prioritize cleanup actions and estimate cleanup costs.

In a forthcoming article, Evangelos Razis, a staff member at the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy & Commerce, and James C. Cooper, a law professor at George Mason University, argued that Congress should pass a moratorium on state AI regulations, allowing Congress to devise a single, nationwide AI law. States’ urgency to pass consumer AI regulations threatens to create a patchwork of laws that would hamper innovation, Razis and Cooper claimed. Congress, however, risks doing more harm by passing a federal regulation too hastily. Razis and Cooper argued that there is past precedent for a temporary moratorium—such as temporary bans on state regulation of commercial space flights or the internet—which would allow more time to evaluate how current laws are managing AI harms and determine what gaps must be filled.

In a working paper published by The George Washington Law Review, Jennifer Nou of the University of Chicago Law School argued that modern presidents rely on the Executive Office of the President (EOP) to coordinate and manage regulatory decisions. She explained that “presidential brokering” is a White House–led process through which advisers gather information, test competing arguments, and guide agencies. Nou described the Domestic Policy Council and National Economic Council as central brokers and that brokering is distinct from other mechanisms like executive orders. Nou contended that brokering can improve responsiveness and the quality of regulatory decisions, but the practice increases opacity, raises decision costs, and risks concentrating too much power in the presidency. She concluded by proposing reforms for presidents, Congress, and courts to enhance transparency, accountability, and the legitimacy of presidential involvement in regulatory policy.

EDITOR’S CHOICE

In an essay in The Regulatory Review, Russell Wheeler, nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program, argued that the 2018–2019 federal government shutdown exposed longstanding “deferred maintenance” of the federal judiciary. Wheeler extended Paul Light’s concept of a “quiet crisis” in public service to the courts, showing how underfunding, unfilled vacancies, and outdated resource allocations have weakened the judiciary’s ability to function as an independent branch. Wheeler identified three main problems worsened by shutdowns: a high number of judicial vacancies, the lack of new judgeships despite rising caseloads, and growing difficulty in recruiting judges and staff. He concluded that, although the crisis may renew attention to public service reform, it is unlikely to generate lasting investment in the courts, leaving the judiciary’s structural deficiencies unaddressed.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WIR.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:45.971255

Toyota Motor North America President Ted Ogawa, said:

Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the U.S. to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,

Toyota’s 11th U.S. factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

Ogawa said on Wednesday,

We know there is no single path to progress,

“That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other automakers like Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits, and eliminated penalties, that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Proposed Exemptions The Proposed Rule seeks to add the following exemptions to the one-time PFAS reporting requirement: De Minimis.
Under the Proposed Rule, PFAS present in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent are exempt from reporting, regardless of total production volume.
The Proposed Rule exempts PFAS imported as part of an article from reporting.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Nov. 13, 2025, published a proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to modify the scope of the Biden-era one-time reporting requirement for manufacturers and importers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

The current rule, published by the EPA in October 2023 (Rule) after being directed to do so by the U.S. Congress under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2020, requires PFAS manufacturers (including importers) to electronically report information regarding uses, production volumes, disposal, exposures and hazards from PFAS or PFAS-containing articles between 2011 and 2022. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""EPA Publishes Comprehensive PFAS Reporting Rule Under TSCA,"" Oct. 17, 2023.) Since publication of the Rule, EPA has extended the reporting deadline twice, most recently extending the start of the data submission period from July 2025 to April 2026.

The Proposed Rule – which responds to stakeholder feedback and the deregulatory priorities of the Trump Administration – aims to reduce unnecessary or duplicative reporting, minimize compliance costs for small manufacturers and focus reporting obligations on those likely to have relevant information. The agency is now proposing several key exemptions and technical clarifications to the Rule, which are expected to significantly reduce compliance burden and costs for regulated entities.

This announcement follows the release of the Trump Administration's regulatory agenda, where the EPA outlined several anticipated actions over the next season, including this Proposed Rule. (See Holland and Knight's previous alert, ""EPA's PFAS Rulemaking Trajectory: Key Updates Across CERCLA, TSCA, RCRA, SDWA and CWA,"" Oct. 7, 2025.)

Proposed Exemptions

The Proposed Rule seeks to add the following exemptions to the one-time PFAS reporting requirement:

De Minimis. Under the Proposed Rule, PFAS present in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent are exempt from reporting, regardless of total production volume. Under the current Rule, there is no de minimis level – all concentrations of PFAS are reportable.

Imported Articles. The Proposed Rule exempts PFAS imported as part of an article from reporting. This exemption, if finalized, will be critical for product importers that are unlikely to have sufficient knowledge of PFAS content in articles due to lack of notification requirements during the reporting period.

Byproducts, Impurities and Non-Isolated Intermediates. PFAS manufactured solely as byproducts (not used for commercial purposes), impurities or non-isolated intermediates are exempt if manufactured under conditions described in 40 C.F.R. 720.30(h).

Research and Development (R&D) Chemicals. PFAS manufactured (including imported) solely in small quantities for R&D purposes are exempt. The EPA determined that these quantities are not commercially relevant and, therefore, reporting would impose significant burden with minimal benefit.

It's the Japanese automaker's first battery plant outside Japan and the company's biggest single-site investment ever. Toyota expects to hire 5,000 staffers.

The plant comes amid a massive shift for automakers.

Clouds have been cast over the future of fully electric vehicles — the government's $7,500 tax credit ended, automakers have been laying off American workers who built EVs, and some companies might discontinue money-losing cars.

But Toyota's approach is different: it's leaning into booming hybrid sales.

'Toyota has put more vehicles with electrified powertrains on the road than any other automaker,' Emily Holland, a spokesperson for Toyota, told the Daily Mail. 'Hybrids represent an entry point into vehicle electrification.'

The North Carolina plant will build lithium-ion batteries for three types of products — hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and fully electric vehicles — with the vast majority devoted to hybrids that Toyota can't build fast enough.

This year, more than half of Toyota's cars sold in the US have some form of electrified engine.

And multiple Toyota best-sellers have gone hybrid-only. The ever-popular Camry no longer offers a gas-only version, and the RAV4, America's best-selling non-pickup truck, will drop its gas-only option in 2026.

In North Carolina, just four of the new facility's 14 planned lines are running, enough to supply battery packs for roughly 600,000 hybrids a year, including the Toyota Camry built in Kentucky and the Corolla Cross SUV in Alabama.

Meanwhile, the plant's plug-in and EV facilities remain more modest.

Toyota is building out capacity for about 74,000 plug-in hybrids and just 45,000 fully electric vehicles.

Those batteries will eventually power a new three-row, American-built electric SUV that Toyota hasn't revealed yet. The company told the Daily Mail it is scheduled to launch in late 2026.

It's a cautious approach that Toyota executives say matches where American buyers actually are.

'Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company's significant manufacturing investment in the US and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers,' Ted Ogawa, the company's US-based chief executive, said.

This massive investment also lands amid a shifting political and economic landscape for automakers.

Toyota broke ground on the facility in 2021, when the Biden administration was focused on building out battery manufacturing in the US.

But US sales of fully electric cars haven't accelerated as lawmakers initially hoped.

President Donald Trump said last month that Toyota would pump $10billion into the US, though the company didn't clarify how the new plant relates to its those spending plans.

At the same time, the industry is navigating Trump's sweeping tariffs on cars and parts.

Cars built in Japan — including around 30 percent of the Toyotas rolling off American dealership lots — are slapped with a 15 percent tariff at the US border.

Toyota's rate has angered Detroit automakers, who often have to pay more in tariffs for US-assembled vehicles.

And tariffs haven't slowed Toyota's momentum.

US sales are up 9.9 percent through the third quarter — more than 1.3million vehicles — driven largely by hybrids, the company can't build fast enough.

The automaker has the lowest days-on-lot metric in the industry, a measure of how quickly vehicles sell after arriving at dealerships.

And with four production lines humming in North Carolina and 10 more on deck, Toyota's bet is clear: the future might be electric, but the runway for hybrid sales remains intact.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/14/15/103887923-0-image-a-63_1763135233366.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 13:01:50.656587

The decision to rescind drilling restrictions in Alaska highlights the complex interplay between economic development, environmental conservation, and energy policy in the United States.","The Trump administration has finalized the reversal of Biden-era restrictions on oil and gas drilling in Alaska’s vast National Petroleum Reserve. This region is renowned for being the largest tract of undisturbed public land in the United States. The decision aligns with President Trump’s broader energy strategy aimed at increasing domestic oil and gas production, particularly in resource-rich areas like Alaska. The move has been met with mixed reactions, highlighting the ongoing debate over energy development versus environmental conservation in the region.

Impact on Alaska’s Land and Wildlife

The rollback of restrictions affects 10.6 million acres of Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, a key area known for its pristine wilderness and diverse wildlife. Environmentalists argue that opening this land to drilling could have detrimental impacts on the ecosystem, threatening species such as polar bears, caribou, and migratory birds. The untouched nature of this land has made it a critical habitat for these species, which rely on the area for breeding and migration.

Proponents of the rollback insist that modern drilling techniques minimize environmental damage. They argue that the regulations in place are sufficient to protect the environment while allowing for energy development. However, critics remain skeptical, pointing to past incidents where oil spills and infrastructure development have caused irreversible harm.

The balance between economic development and environmental protection remains a contentious issue in Alaska.

Economic Implications for Local Communities

For local communities, particularly the Alaska Native group Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, the rollback is seen as a positive step. The group supports oil and gas development as it generates significant tax revenues, which fund essential services such as healthcare and education. Jobs created by the energy sector are also crucial for the economic stability of these communities.

However, the economic benefits are not uniformly distributed. While some communities see significant gains, others are concerned about the long-term sustainability of relying on fossil fuel extraction. The debate continues over whether the short-term economic boost is worth the potential environmental cost and the eventual transition to renewable energy sources.

National Energy Security and Policy Directions

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum emphasized the rollback as a move towards enhancing American energy security. By increasing domestic oil production, the United States aims to reduce its dependence on foreign oil imports, thereby strengthening its energy independence. This aligns with the Trump administration’s broader policy of prioritizing domestic energy production.

Trump Finalizes Gulf Oil Lease, Proposes 2026 Alaska Sale: What This Means for U.S. Energy Future

The decision also reflects a shift in policy direction from the previous administration, which emphasized transitioning to renewable energy sources. The Biden-era rule was part of a larger strategy to combat climate change by limiting fossil fuel extraction. The reversal highlights the ongoing policy tug-of-war between environmental sustainability and energy independence.

The Future of U.S. Energy Policy

The rollback of Biden-era restrictions raises questions about the future trajectory of U.S. energy policy. As global conversations intensify around climate change and sustainable development, the United States faces pressure to balance its energy needs with environmental responsibilities. The current administration’s focus on oil and gas development could impact international relations, particularly with countries prioritizing renewable energy.

The decision also underscores the importance of bipartisan dialogue in shaping a cohesive energy policy that addresses both economic and environmental concerns. As the energy landscape evolves, so too must the policies that govern it, ensuring they are adaptable to new challenges and opportunities.

The decision to rescind drilling restrictions in Alaska highlights the complex interplay between economic development, environmental conservation, and energy policy in the United States. As the nation grapples with these competing priorities, what future strategies will best balance these vital interests?

That brought the total share of renewables in global electricity – solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal – to 43%.
“Record solar power growth and stagnating fossil fuels in 2025 show how clean power has become the driving force in the power sector,” said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember.
The next big question: can solar, wind, and the rest of the clean power sector keep up this pace consistently?","Solar and wind are growing fast enough to meet all new electricity demand worldwide for the first three quarters of 2025, according to new data from energy think tank Ember. The group now expects fossil power to stay flat for the full year, marking the first time since the pandemic that fossil generation won’t increase.

Solar and wind aren’t just expanding; they’re outpacing global electricity demand itself. Solar generation jumped 498 TWh (+31%) compared to the same period last year, already topping all the solar power produced in 2024. Wind added another 137 TWh (+7.6%). Together, they supplied 635 TWh of new clean electricity, beating out the 603 TWh rise in global demand (+2.7%).

That lifted solar and wind to 17.6% of global electricity in the first three quarters of the year, up from 15.2% year-over-year. That brought the total share of renewables in global electricity – solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy, and geothermal – to 43%. Fossil fuels slid to 57.1%, down from 58.7%.

Renewables are beating coal

For the first time in 2025, renewables collectively generated more electricity than coal. And fossil generation as a whole has stalled. Fossil output slipped slightly by 0.1% (-17 TWh) through the end of Q3. Ember expects no fossil-fuel growth for the full year, driven by clean power growth outpacing demand.

China and India are partly driving that shift. In China, fossil generation fell 52 TWh (-1.1%) as clean energy met all new demand, resulting from a structural change in its power system. India saw fossil generation drop 34 TWh (-3.3%), thanks to record solar and wind growth and milder weather.

Solar is leading the charge

Solar is doing the heavy lifting. It’s now the single biggest driver of change in the global power sector, with growth more than three times larger than any other electricity source in the first three quarters of the year.

“Record solar power growth and stagnating fossil fuels in 2025 show how clean power has become the driving force in the power sector,” said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember. “Historically a growth segment, fossil power now appears to be entering a period of stagnation and managed decline. China, the largest source of fossil growth, has turned a corner, signaling that reliance on fossil fuels to meet growing power demand is no longer required.”

Electricity demand rose 2.7% in the first three quarters of 2025, far slower than the 4.9% jump seen last year when extreme heatwaves pushed up cooling demand in China, India, and the US. This year’s milder weather helped take some pressure off the grid, making it easier for clean energy to close the gap.

A turning point for the global power system

For the first time outside of major crises such as the pandemic or the global financial crash, clean energy growth has not only kept up with demand but surpassed it. The next big question: can solar, wind, and the rest of the clean power sector keep up this pace consistently? If they can, 2025 may be remembered as the year global fossil generation plateaued.

A series of major development projects have failed to pan out. The reasons are diverse, but a common thread ran through them: serious local opposition. Backers of the projects fought through that — for a while — but the NIMBYism on display in each case sent a potent message that is really starting to add up.

We’re seeing this again with OpenAI and Oracle’s massive data center near Ann Arbor. It got the green light only after the developer agreed to fork over $14 million to address local concerns. Before that? Opposition from township officials who suddenly discovered all sorts of worries about a project that would bring substantial investment to the area. And the rumblings of discontent are far from over.

It's becoming a troubling pattern.

A $63 billion semiconductor factory near Flint — nearly 10,000 jobs — walked away, citing economic uncertainty but in the context of massive local opposition. The Gotion battery plant near Big Rapids? Dead after years of local battles and a recall election.

Even a project that has kept moving forward, like Ford Motor Co.’s battery plant in Marshall, has done so in the face of legal challenges.

Certainly, these failures aren’t just about NIMBYism. National economic turbulence and the EV slowdown played a role. Gotion's ties to China created real concerns beyond typical local opposition. But when companies are deciding where to invest billions of dollars, they're watching how Michigan handles these situations. And what they're seeing isn’t going to encourage them.

The message we're sending is: Come to Michigan if you want, but be prepared to fight with local officials, navigate recalls, shell out millions in sweeteners, and maybe still watch the whole thing fall apart.

That really is not the message we want site selectors to get from our state.

Communities should have a voice in what gets built in their backyards. There are legitimate questions about traffic, environmental impact and water usage. But there's a difference between healthy skepticism and reflexive opposition to anything big and new. Too often, Michigan communities seem to be defaulting to the latter.

Michigan spent decades watching manufacturing jobs disappear, watching companies build plants in Tennessee and Kentucky and Alabama instead. When we land a few big projects — batteries, semiconductors, data centers — we seem to be going out of our way to find ways to chase them off.

We can’t let local opposition become the default setting every time a major employer shows interest in Michigan.

There are success stories. Ford's battery plant in Marshall faced opposition but pushed through. It's on track to open next year. The data center near Ann Arbor seems to be moving forward, though there is still an undercurrent of opposition.

Other states are eating our lunch while we argue. They've streamlined their processes. They've made it clear to companies that if you're bringing jobs and investment, you'll find a partner and not an obstacle course.

It’s an important question: The Gotion and Mundy Township sites are still there, with tens of millions of dollars poured into them to prep them to one day be put to use.

Outreach to those communities to make that easier should be going on even in the absence of a new proposal. Lawmakers should also look at ways to give municipal leaders more legal insulation against opponents of using land for the purpose for which it is zoned.

But ultimately, it's incumbent on individual citizens of Michigan to get over the reflexive opposition to change. That has never gotten us very far. And anyone can make the case for progress to their neighbors, which is powerful persuasion.

Because if we continue to hound away major investment, Michigan will cease to be considered — and will cease to have an economic future.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Copy%20of%20Copy%20of%2032%20supertamplate.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:53.704336

First Solar, Inc. announced that it will establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the company’s international fleet.

The company expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the U.S. by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the U.S. By 2027, the company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.",,N,,2025-11-14 17:02:06.994819

It’s not a target, it’s not a goal, it’s a limit, it’s a boundary,” Rockstrom told The Associated Press.
Scientists don't know exactly when and where the danger kicks in during overshoot, nor which is more dangerous: spending a longer period above 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, or warming to levels much higher than 1.5.
The study found they would peak around 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) and not fall back under until the 2060s.","Belem, Brazil — The world's climate leaders are conceding that Earth's warming will shoot past a hard limit they set a decade ago in hopes of keeping the planet out of a danger zone. But they're not conceding defeat.

United Nations officials, scientists, and analysts are pinning their hopes on eventually forcing global temperatures back below the red line they set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which sought to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times.

Busting that limit and then coming back down is called “overshoot."" In the way climate science uses the term, it doesn't mean zooming by a red line and never looking back — it's all about seeing the line in the rear view mirror and making a U-turn to get back to lower temperatures.

After years of considering the 1.5 mark a strict no-go situation, officials have in the past few weeks started talking about limiting the time and magnitude of Earth's stay in the danger zone.

The 1.5 figure is based on temperatures averaged over a decade.

‘It’s not a target, it’s not a goal, it’s a limit’

Many scientists have said it's inevitable the 1.5 degree mark will be passed. The mark won't be considered breached until Earth goes beyond it over a 10-year average. It stands now at about 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), and last year alone actually exceeded the 1.5 mark.

It may be inevitable, but it won't be pretty, they say.

“We have a real risk of triggering irreversible changes in Earth systems when we breach 1.5,’’ said Johan Rockstrom, director of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Research and a science advisor to the U.N.'s annual climate conference currently being held in the Brazilian Amazon city of Belem.

Those risks include global extinction of coral reefs and exponential growth of killer heat waves. There's also a risk of triggering tipping points for irreversible changes, such as drying out the Amazon rainforest, melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica and maybe even shutting down the entire Atlantic ocean current system, said Rockstrom and Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare. Similar concerns were raised in a special 2018 U.N. report that showed how 1.5 starts the danger zone.

“In Belem, we have more scientific evidence than we had 10 years ago that 1.5 is a real limit. It’s not a target, it’s not a goal, it’s a limit, it’s a boundary,” Rockstrom told The Associated Press. “Go beyond it, we increase suffering of people, and we increase risk of crossing tipping points.”

Likely to be a breach

For the past few years, scientists have said while it's technically possible for the world to stay at or below 1.5, it's not realistic. They calculate the planet is on pace for 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s, which ushered in the Industrial Revolution and a massive uptick in burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

For years, U.N. officials have insisted that 1.5 is still alive. But now, even though they insist the goal is still pertinent, those same leaders in the last few weeks have acknowledged that it will likely be breached in coming years or decades.

“The science is clear: We can and must bring temperatures back down to 1.5 Celsius after any temporary overshoot,” U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said as this year's conference began.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking in Geneva last month, was even more blunt, though he added hope.

“Overshooting is now inevitable, which means that we are going to have a period, bigger or smaller, with higher or lower intensity, above 1.5 degrees in the years to come,” Guterres said. “Now, that doesn’t mean that we are condemned to live with 1.5 degrees lost. No.”

U.N. officials said the goal of the 1.5 mark should remain even after the world breaches that mark because it's a target worth keeping.

Overshoot is fallback position

The idea behind overshoot is that temperatures will push past the 1.5 mark, but will be reduced over time. The hope is that once the world stops putting heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere from burning coal, oil and natural gas, that natural carbon sinks such as trees and oceans that suck the carbon pollution out of the air will bring levels down. There's also hope that new technologies will pull carbon dioxide out of the air.

Once the concentration of carbon in the air goes down, so will temperatures — eventually. A lot depends on technology that isn't yet available at any scale large enough to help.

“Without carbon dioxide removal it is simply impossible to manage the overshoot scenario,"" said Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research and chairman of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.

Scientists don't know exactly when and where the danger kicks in during overshoot, nor which is more dangerous: spending a longer period above 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, or warming to levels much higher than 1.5.

But they do know the world is likely to be in that zone for decades.

The latest analysis by scientists with Climate Action Tracker shows that if the world does everything possible to reduce emissions — something it has never done — global temperatures are likely to breach 1.5 degrees around 2030. The study found they would peak around 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) and not fall back under until the 2060s.

But the world's present course is not for a small overshoot, but rather a complete miss, with temperatures still rising in 2100, Hare said.

“Ten years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 Celsius entirely, basically with low or no overshoot,"" Rockstrom said. “Now we are 10 years later, we have failed.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/26/PDTN/85831038007-ap-25229479934140.jpg?crop=5858,3298,x0,y299&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-14 16:02:09.407810

The action aligns with the general approach EPA has taken under President Trump, which includes rolling back other PFAS regulatory action.

Background

The initial regulation, which was issued by EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), was finalized at the end of 2023, as we discussed here. As summarized on EPA’s website for these TSCA reporting requirements, both the Biden and Trump administrations pushed back the compliance deadlines from the initial regulation.

According to EPA’s press release, the edits in this proposed rule, which are the first substantive changes to the initial regulation, were “to make them more practical and implementable and reduce unnecessary, or potentially duplicative, reporting requirements for businesses.” The initial rule estimates that the changes will save roughly 10-11 million hours and therefore $786-$843 million, 9.3-9.9 hours of which and $703-$761 million of which will be saved by small businesses. [Note: the TSCA defines small manufacturers as those with (1) under $120 million in revenue and less than 100,000 pounds in production volume for a chemical substance or (2) revenues less than $12 million. It is unclear if that is how the rule is defining small businesses in terms of time and money saved.]

Changes in the Rule

The primary focus of the changes in the rule is the inclusion of exceptions to reporting. The proposed rule excepts the following categories:

De Minimis Concentrations – concentrations under 0.1%.

The proposed rule focuses on the mismatch between the backward-facing requirements of the regulation and the fact that companies generally were not required to keep this information, which could especially cause issues for imports.

However, the rule notes that there is no production volume limitation, which means that this exception could allow for large volumes of PFAS as long as they are part of very large quantities of base products (g., it would allow for 100 pounds of PFAS on a product that is greater than 100,000 pounds).

Imported Articles – PFAS imported as part of an article (a term defined in the TSCA).

The focus here again is on the mismatch between what was required to be provided at the time of receipt versus what would be required under this new rule.

However, given the international nature of the U.S. economy, this could exempt significant amounts of information.

Byproducts, Impurities, Non-Isolated Intermediaries, etc. – chemical mixtures that fit the definitions in 40 CFR 720.30(h), which are generally focused on subsidiary aspects of the manufacturing process and those that are not provided to the public.

The focus here is on an expected lack of value/relevance in the information related to these products.

However, the practical impact of this exception on the overall quantification and evaluation of PFAS is unclear.

Research and Development (R&D) Chemicals – PFAS manufactured or imported for R&D purposes.

The focus here again is that this information would provide minimal practical value.

However, there will be no limit to the quantity here that would be exempted (although regulations do limit the amount that could qualify for R&D as an amount “not greater than reasonably necessary for such purposes.”

The proposed rule also discusses clarifications and technical corrections.

Potential Other Changes – Requests for Comments

Although the changes proposed in this initial rule are limited in scope, EPA is also requesting comment on other related issues that could greatly expand the scope of the changes from the initial rule including:

Raising the de minimis threshold to 1.0% (instead of 0.1%).

Whether the National Defense Authorization Act (which edited the TSCA in 2020) should be read as excluding imports altogether (thus making an exception unnecessary and potentially impacting other regulations).

Amending the scope of PFAS covered under this rule.

Modifying any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its economic analysis.

Next Steps

Comments on the proposed rule must be received by December 29, 2025. They can be provided here and should include docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPPT-2020-0549.

The reporting period would then start 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and then last for three months.",https://www.californiawaterviews.com/assets/images-t1763147456/1941.png,N,,2025-11-14 15:00:50.531814

The ProZision range includes 54-inch and 60-inch manual models, as well as a 60-inch autonomous model.
The manual ProZision models will go on sale in February 2026 and the autonomous model will follow in Summer 2026.
“Honda is unveiling the ProZision and ProZision Autonomous battery-powered ZTR lawn mowers as the industry navigates uncertainty in workforce stability, equipment investment returns, and operational cost controls—across short- and long-term horizons,” said Mark Kohls, VP of Honda Power Sports & Products, American Honda Motor.
“Honda ProZision lawn mowers provide zero-emission options that complement gasoline-powered fleets to reduce operating costs and enhance sustainability in landscape maintenance.”","Honda Power Sports & Products, a subsidiary of American Honda Motor, has launched a new lineup of battery-powered, zero-turn-radius (ZTR) lawnmowers branded under the ProZision name.

The ProZision range includes 54-inch and 60-inch manual models, as well as a 60-inch autonomous model. The lawnmowers further diversify the company’s outdoor power product portfolio for a variety of users, conditions and commercial applications.

The lawnmowers are powered by five 48 V brushless electric motors: three deck motors that rotate MicroCut Twin Blades and two drive wheel motors that maneuver the vehicle with precise control. The mowers are fitted with six lithium-ion batteries and a 4.3-inch touchscreen display panel that indicates operation status and battery state of charge. The motors and charging system incorporate electrical quick connectors for fast and easy connection and disconnection for service.

The models provide sufficient power to mow at higher speeds. Three different driving modes—Rapid, Normal and Precise—allow the operator to control mower speed to adjust to various turf conditions.

The chassis and main components are constructed from durable steel, with high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel used strategically to provide strength while minimizing weight.

The manual HZ54SXB features a 54-inch cutting width and uses 19-inch MicroCut Twin Blades with a side-discharge deck. It charges in 16.5 hours at 120 V or 6.5 hours at 240 V. The mower offers a run time of 4.2-4.5 hours and can cover approximately 13-14 acres, depending on conditions.

The manual HZ60SXB has a 60-inch cutting width and a side-discharge deck equipped with 21-inch MicroCut Twin Blades. Charging takes 16.5 hours at 120 V or 6.5 hours at 240 V. It provides a run time of 4-4.3 hours, covering around 14-15 acres depending on conditions.

The autonomous HZA60RXB offers a 60-inch cutting width and a rear-discharge deck with 21-inch MicroCut Twin Blades. It charges in 16.5 hours at 120 V or 6.5 hours at 240 V. The mower can cover up to 15 acres, depending on operating conditions. It also features omnidirectional sensing, providing a full 360-degree view via radar and LiDAR sensors for obstacle detection. The rear-discharge deck directs debris backward rather than sideways, reducing the risk of hitting nearby objects or people during autonomous operation.

All three models are backed by a commercial limited warranty of three years or 2,000 hours, whichever comes first.

The ProZision model will be produced at the Honda manufacturing facility in Swepsonville, North Carolina, using globally made parts. The manual ProZision models will go on sale in February 2026 and the autonomous model will follow in Summer 2026.

Bryce Cornet: EV batteries are packaged more robustly if it is a safety recall.","As EV adoption accelerates, so does the frequency of battery recalls—and the operational expertise they require.

In recent months, a string of recalls from major automakers has underscored the complexities of EV battery systems. Hyundai recently pulled back a limited number of 2025 IONIQ 5s in the US after identifying a short-circuit risk linked to a faulty battery pack busbar. Ford has expanded its recall of 2022 Mustang Mach-E models with extended-range batteries owing to overheating contactors that could cause a sudden loss of drive power. And BMW has faced back-to-back recalls—one affecting more than 70,000 vehicles over a software issue that could cause the high-voltage system to shut down unexpectedly, and another targeting 136 EVs in the US for incorrectly assembled battery cell modules that could lead to power loss or fire.

In some cases, these issues can be remedied with software updates. In others, the battery needs to be removed entirely and replaced.

Unlike traditional vehicle recalls, which can often be resolved with a quick part swap, removing and replacing an EV battery can take hours and must be repeated across hundreds or thousands of vehicles—often under tight timelines. For a recent luxury EV model recall of more than 25,000 vehicles, the removal took nine hours per battery.

Once consumers are notified, an extensive technical response is mobilized. Teams of technicians, transport specialists and supply chain managers coordinate a complex operation to ensure that every recalled battery is safely handled, shipped, and then repaired, recycled or disposed of under strict protocols.

To understand the realities of this process, Charged spoke with Bryce Cornet, Senior Manager of Supply Chain Logistics at EV Battery Solutions by Cox Automotive.

We discussed what happens behind the scenes of an EV battery recall, how the process differs from traditional ICE vehicle recalls, and the safety protocols that determine where each battery ends up.

Charged: What are the first steps when a battery recall is announced?

Bryce Cornet: The first thing that is considered is whether it is a safety recall or a traditional mechanical recall.

When batteries have a safety recall applied to them, most of the time an OEM has had discussions with agencies like NHTSA and then released an announcement to customers. Customers get a letter in the mail saying the battery in their vehicle is affected by a safety recall. There could be instructions, depending on how severe the safety situation is, but for the most part it’s to explain to the customer that they need to bring their car in for battery replacement.

If the recall is large enough, it may be bucketed based on the criticality of potential failures. The OEM will have data around when the production failure happened. Some batteries may be more critical than others, and they have an idea of which Vehicle Identification Numbers, or VINs, have these batteries in them. That’s something we’re able to help with too, because we have a software system that ties into the vehicle.

Often dealers are doing these repairs for the OEM. Is the dealer prepared to take on a large number of recalled repairs? They may go from doing one repair a month to 20 repairs a month. Do they have the space to store battery packs? What are the ergonomics of moving a battery through a dealership network? Do they have the tools?

Another question is whether the recall is pack-level or cell-level. Primarily, what we deal with are module- and cell-level recalls. In that case, the whole battery pack is removed from the vehicle and shipped to us, either for module replacements—maybe we can find the critical module and replace it and certify it—or it could be that the full battery pack needs to be re-cycled, in which case we do disassembly operations to make it safe to recycle.

On top of disassembly and recycling, there is a storage component to consider. Some of these battery packs may be held for a certain amount of time, but they need to be held safely.

Our warehouses at EV Battery Solutions have high-pressure fire suppression systems. We support the dealer in getting batteries away from the dealership as quickly as possible, because they often don’t have a lot of extra storage for battery packs. The important thing is getting the pack and storing it if we have to, or getting it quickly to recycling, to get rid of any type of risk.

Charged: How is transportation handled, given the risks of shipping large lithium-ion batteries?

Bryce Cornet: EV batteries are packaged more robustly if it is a safety recall. A portion of this is planning, to safely transport a battery from a dealership or from distribution sites. That battery has to move through public ecosystems on trucks.

When a safety recall hits, the battery falls under a hazmat regulation in 49 CFR with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, PHMSA, which states if the battery is damaged, defective or recalled, it cannot be transported by air or other means. We’re passionate about making recycling as close to a dealership as possible, because you don’t want to transport batteries far that potentially could have safety recalls.

Charged: Can you walk us through the logistical process of removing and handling a recalled battery?

Bryce Cornet: The process varies based on the OEM, because every OEM has their secret sauce for how the battery fits into the vehicle. The form factor is different. You’re often dealing with high-voltage connections, and it may not be easy to get to them to pull them out.

One thing that we often run into, in addition to understanding how difficult it could be for dealers to remove that from the vehicle, is simply when we get it to our sites, there’s another layer of complexity, depending on how the battery shell mounts over the modules. Is it sealed with a glue? Is it bolted down and sealed?

We have to account for the time it takes to do the disassembly-to-recycling option, because often there’s a rush to get these batteries off the road and get them recycled quickly. That can be quite the undertaking, especially as it can take anywhere from four to nine hours to fully disassemble a battery pack.

Charged: What are the biggest safety risks technicians face during battery removal, and how are those managed?

Bryce Cornet: The biggest risk is that you’re dealing with something that has charge within it, which is somewhat different from pulling an engine out. You’re having to work around high-voltage cables. There is a process to limit the voltage on the pack before they work on it, which should be a part of training.

Personal protective equipment, PPE, while they’re doing the job is likely different from traditional repairs and is important. And then after you remove the pack you don’t want to store the battery pack outside.

Depending on what may be communicated by the OEM, if it is a safety recall and there are risks, you have to consider storage and packaging. You want to make sure that it’s packaged in compliant packaging and not left on a pallet outside. There are also requirements to protect the environment that the dealer would need to know.

Charged: Are there enough skilled technicians in the industry to manage the process?

Bryce Cornet: Part of the safety aspect is safe scaling. We often have to train, hire and rehire to stand up more disassembly base. The dealer may also have to dedicate more people and more bays to these repairs, because that’s the quickest way to address long repair times.

Every time we’ve done a recall, we’ve had to hire new people that may not have been involved with EV batteries before, and that’s a risk. You have to be on it with operating instructions, having safety meetings every morning, and training your team before turning them loose on potential repairs. Dealers face the same issues with getting new EV technicians.

The number is growing, but it’s not necessarily at the point where every OEM is happy with the number of EV-certified techs.

We have an initiative inside Cox that is training all of our Manheim Auction sites to be EV-certified. Dealers are doing the same thing and that’s getting better. But finding high-quality, good talent to work on EVs can be a challenge—it is a difference from ICE. You see a lot of ICE technicians moving over to EVs, because some OEMs are adding more EVs to their fleets.

Charged: How does an EV recall differ from an ICE recall?

Bryce Cornet: One thing is the size—the battery can be quite large. One of the recalls we supported was a battery pack that was about 1,000 pounds. It was about 1,800 pounds in a crate in total. You have a dealership inserting an item that may be five times the size of the engines and transmissions they’re used to dealing with.

And that leads into other factors that are different for EV batteries. It goes all the way down to logistics. Carriers are used to moving all kinds of cargo, not just batteries. We need to educate the carrier to take precautions when they’re handling a battery.

There are technical requirements when we take an order. A dealer will contact us to say they have a vehicle down and need a battery. There is specific information we need to take from the dealer about the battery that is different from a transmission.

On a transmission, you’re looking at mileage as an indicator of health. But for batteries, you are looking at mileage, but you’re also looking at state of charge, how much percentage charge is in the battery. That affects how the OEM and how we interact with the battery when it arrives.

When we get a battery in, we’re often assessing if it’s good enough to go back into a vehicle or not. Is it safe? Are there things we can do to repair it, or does it need to go to recycling? There are different technical requirements for EVs, for us to make a decision on its criticality.

Charged: How do you decide whether it’s repaired, recycled or scrapped?

Bryce Cornet: You wouldn’t want to find out that a vehicle that was once a part of a safety recall ever has a battery that is part of another recall. Most of the time these batteries—the full packs—are disassembled and recycled immediately.

When we take in a battery, we get a core of varying health. The dealer doesn’t know of its health, usually, and we transport it here to diagnose it. We run a series of resistance measurements and voltage checks to get a baseline of what we’re looking at. Those baseline measurements are often partnered with diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, that tell us if there’s a low cell, a dead cell, or something specific.

Enough of that data leads us to a direction to tell if it is a good repair. If it has this DTC and these readings, we can potentially repair it. If it falls outside that window, we may have to recycle it.

At one time, we were manufacturing our own second-life energy storage systems. We’ve since stopped, but we do support other entities and OEMs with finding and testing battery cores to potentially allow them to do second life.

What we’ve often found difficult is that, to be used for second life, a battery has to be in a sweet spot in between being good enough to go back into a car or bad enough that it needs to be recycled. And as profitable as recycling is becoming, for a lot of OEMs and for recyclers, there’s less of the second use happening.

Charged: What’s the biggest recall you’ve been involved in?

Bryce Cornet: The biggest recall affected about 150,000 vehicles in the US and Europe. My team had been doing 200-300 battery shipments a month, and at the peak of this recall we were doing about 600 battery shipments a day from a site in Detroit and a site in Oklahoma City.

We were shipping out new batteries and getting back the bad batteries. These batteries weighed 1,500 pounds, and there was a process in which we had to move each battery from one crate to another before we could ship it. We had workstations with cranes, and we built a whole process where it was like a pit stop for a battery. We had about four people under that crane and they all had their job. The same thing was done for the shipping process to speed up how many we were doing.

We had a timeline of how quickly this specific client wanted the recall completed. We reduced our fulfillment times from about 20 minutes per battery pack to about five minutes. There were software enhancements that we did to make it more automated. We developed a Quick Connect system to lift the battery pack out that saved five minutes alone. In these large peaks of volume, you start to see a lot of innovation happen.

Charged: Are you seeing innovations in robotics or AI that could be incorporated into the process?

Bryce Cornet: It could be valuable in assessing a battery for damage when it’s brought in. We’re also looking into robotic automation to limit the risk to technicians from having to pull modules out of the battery, and cut out any issues with human error that could happen with tedious tasks like replacing modules.

Charged: As commercial EV adoption increases, how does that potentially affect a big recall?

Bryce Cornet: We have a lot of partners where we deal with battery packs as large as 4,500 to 10,000 pounds, where you’re touching some of those commercial applications.

We have an efficient model to deal with scaling for a recall. But any time that happens we run into issues like truck availability. Moving these large battery packs requires specific types of logistics or carrier transport—specific trailers to move the battery on. That could strain the supply chain, because it’s not traditional for those trailers to be used in high volume.

We’re knowledgeable about that now, because we’ve faced it, but in a high volume we would have to work with our partners to make that change.

Charged: As EV adoption grows, do you expect recalls to become more frequent, or could the technology develop in a way that recalls become less likely?

Bryce Cornet: It’s hard to say. It is true that as the sample size grows, we could have more recalls just from having more EVs on the road, or OEMs trying more things.

But what’s interesting is the changing of chemistries. A lot of OEMs are talking about LFP. The term solid-state is thrown around a lot, and there are a lot of different potential chemistries and ideas. How does LFP affect potential recalls? Does it make it better or worse? Is it easier to handle LFP than the traditional NMC packs? We don’t have the answer yet, but as some of these OEMs change their chemistries, we’ll quickly find out.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Inside-the-EV-battery-recall-process—the-complexity-of-safety-and-logistics-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:02:52.729621

The rains were very heavy and it was difficult to walk; the water on the roads was ankle-deep.
Slowly, the water came up to my waist, but I continued walking as if I wasn’t aware.
The water could not be pumped, so we had to carry water up from the ground floor.
I make it a point that my husband informs me that he has reached office safely and at what point he’s leaving the office.","It was raining that day, and very windy. I was in my office, and one of my colleagues said he had heard on the radio that the trains would stop very soon because the tracks had become flooded. He said, “Ruchira, why don’t you leave?” He knew that I had two daughters and had to relieve my childcare by 6pm.

Immediately, I collected my bag and umbrella and called my husband. I didn’t know what was happening. My colleague advised me not to sit in the ladies’ coach on the train (in Mumbai we have a separate coach for ladies). He said, “You’d better go in the general coach, because if something happens you will have the support of other people there.”

The station was about 10 minutes from my office. Rain was hitting my body. My umbrella was useless in that wind and rain. A lot of water was already on the road. I remember my lower legs, feet and shoes were wet by the time I reached the station.

There were a lot of people, a lot of noise, at Churchgate station; everyone wanted to catch a train and go home. There were public announcements about train services getting affected. I walked on board and sat down in the last train leaving the station. It was crowded and moved very slowly because of the water on the tracks. The roof of the coach was leaking, so we were all sitting with open umbrellas inside the coach. After five or six stations, the train stopped at Bandra, where it was announced that the train would not move further because of the flooding on the tracks.

There were still quite a few people at the station. I got out of the train and crossed the bridge, over the platform, to reach the road. It was raining very heavily, and on the bridge you could feel the rain and the wind more. I couldn’t open my eyes. I was not wearing a raincoat. I just had my bag, which I clung tightly to my body to give me some warmth. I was already almost all wet. There were still quite a few people at the station.

I crossed the bridge, thinking, “What should I do?” Home was still another four to five stations away, and then I would need to take a bus or taxi from the train station. My husband’s office, Bandra Kurla Complex, was in the vicinity, so I called him from a public phone. He said, “My office is closing early. People are scared about the floods. The buses will be leaving soon to take us home. Come to my office and we will go together.”

I started walking, hoping to find a taxi or an autorickshaw to take me to his office, but there were none. I continued walking, I don’t remember how far. I reached a big intersection going towards the Bandra Kurla Complex. The rains were very heavy and it was difficult to walk; the water on the roads was ankle-deep. I stopped a truck and told the driver I needed to go to Bandra Kurla Complex. There was a gas station nearby, and he said, “I can drop you there.”

From there I started walking towards my husband’s office, across the road. It was a considerable distance because the roads were very broad. The water there was about knee-deep, but I continued walking.

Slowly, the water came up to my waist, but I continued walking as if I wasn’t aware. I did not even think about if there were any loose electric wires or open drains in the middle of the road. I just continued walking.

Opposite my husband’s office there were cars floating in the water. I felt amused at first; then I felt fear. I reached my husband’s office, where the buses were parked, waiting to take people to their homes. Some buses which had left earlier started to come back. The roads were all flooded, so there was no way they could go further.

It was 5 or 6pm already. My daughters were alone at home with the caregiver. A friend of mine lived in another residence complex some distance away from mine. I could not connect to her, but I knew if I sent my daughters to her she would take care of them. But you had to walk up a small slope to reach her place. I told my helper to take the children to my friend’s place. She said there was no way they could, because the water was coming down from the slope at very high speed. They would have drowned in that water.

I called the wife of my husband’s colleague, who lived in the same complex. I don’t take favours easily from anyone. But I had no choice; I had to ask for a favour. I asked my helper, “Drop them to this madam’s place”. My oldest was six. My younger one was just three. I spoke with my daughters on the phone. I started crying. My oldest said, “Don’t worry, mama. We’ll be fine. I’ll take care of her.” Then I talked to my youngest. She was like, “No mama, I want you. Mama, come home. When will you come home?” That was very traumatic for me. I was relieved that they would not be alone at home and would be with family. I was praying that my daughters would remain safe. I am a strong believer in prayers.

After settling my daughters, I was OK. I felt very cold, because I was drenched and there was air conditioning in the office. There used to be a canteen there, so the staff broke open all the cupboards and whatever they could find, they tried to cook. Since food was limited, it was rationed out so that everyone could get something to eat, as we were not aware how long this would last. One spoon of rice, one spoon of dal.

We tried to make ourselves comfortable. There was a big hallway. There were some couches there and my husband and I sat on one couch; other people also sat on couches, or went back to their cubicles. The roads were still flooded the next day; no transportation was working. Some people went out and tried to reach home, but came back. There was muddy water everywhere. We were in the office the whole day.

My niece called me. She was living with us in Mumbai, interning with a law firm. I did not know whether she was in her office or out somewhere trying to reach home, stuck in the floods. She told me she had slept in the office the first night and then walked home. It took her two to three hours. I told her, “Please get my daughters home and keep them with you. Give them food.”

On the third day the rains stopped, but the water was still on the roads. There was no food and I needed my inhaler. I’m asthmatic, and was not carrying my inhaler in my bag. I was having difficulty breathing. There was a hospital just across the road. My husband could not walk in the water, because he had some injury on his foot. He said: “There’s no rain now. See if you can go to the hospital and get medicines from the pharmacy.”

Nothing had been done by the civic authorities to clean up the roads. It was all kichir (muddy slush). I managed to reach the hospital. Inside, there were a lot of staff, doctors and nurses. I went to the pharmacy, bought the medicines, and then saw the canteen.

Of course, I was hungry, and I knew there was no more food in the office. I asked if I could also get some food. I said, “I’ve come from this office. I’m hungry and I need to take my medicines, so please can I get some food?” I don’t think I can explain the emotions I went through. I started to cry.

I realised the humiliation and the helplessness of begging for food. They were considerate. I got some food from them. I came back to the office and told my husband, “I got food there. I’m glad that there’s one person less for the office to give food to.”

That evening it was decided: “Let us venture out and try to go back home.” The people who had cars made carpools. It was decided that my husband and I would travel in two different cars, because even if one car got stuck somewhere or something happened at least one of us would still be safe and could reach home. We did not know what to expect out on the roads. It was very scary. Would we encounter more water? The buses were stuck on the road. There were no lights on the streets. A lot of responsibility was on the driver. Filth and mess was everywhere.

I think I reached home first. I was relieved to have made it back safely, for my daughters. There was no electricity, no running water. As Mumbai had a regular electricity supply, we had no candles at home. The water could not be pumped, so we had to carry water up from the ground floor. We were living on the third or fourth floor.

Electricity was restored one or two days after I reached home. Then the newspapers started coming. The stories were so sad and so scary. People drowned in cars. People left home to bring their children from school and drowned in maintenance holes. Electric wires broke from the poles and fell into the water, so people were electrocuted.

For the next year I avoided going to work if it was raining heavily. I was scared of leaving my daughters alone at home again. I’m traumatised. I’m afraid to go out if it rains heavily. I had not realised it until recently. I make it a point that my husband informs me that he has reached office safely and at what point he’s leaving the office. Even small things worry me now.

At the time, there was no mention of climate change. Now, when I look back, I know this is the result of climate change. It has been creeping up on us slowly, and now it is there for everyone to realise. Climate change is happening around us. Each one of us has a role in it. The only hope we have is the youth and the children. They’re trying to bring more awareness, to pressurise governments to take positive action.

I haven’t seen much change since the floods. Life went on quite like normal after that. I feel sad about it. I feel sad about all the lives that were lost. I feel sorry. No one was willing to take responsibility. I felt we were completely deserted and left to our own fate. People have to take responsibility.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/483ce61bdd9d79060937ebe802d160431caba499/519_328_4372_3497/master/4372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0894985b8621174ab196e91f52aa787a",N,,2025-11-14 15:01:14.016922

Compared to current flows, meeting the USD590bn annual net zero financing gap would require a nearly 22-fold increase in climate finance flows.","The net zero financing gap

The amount of money needed to deliver net zero still exceeds annual spending on emissions reductions, but achieving the required investment appears tantalizingly within reach. This is the headline finding from the third annual Climate Policy Initiative/A&O Shearman study ""How big is the net zero financing gap?"", which analyzes the differential between committed climate finance and the capital needed to decarbonize the global economy by 2050.

If the current trajectory of climate investment (26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2020 and 2023) can be sustained in the coming years, annual climate finance flows could approach USD6.2 trillion by 2029, the lower bound of estimated needs for the period 2024 to 2030.

Having said that, mounting geopolitical headwinds threaten to slow momentum, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions to bridge the gap and keep global climate goals in sight.

The study reveals that:

Climate finance flows have hit new highs in recent years, with global investment in mitigation and adaptation measures reaching USD1.9tn in 2023, the last year for which full data is available. Based on our projections, this figure was expected to surpass USD2tn for the first time in 2024.

Across all major sectors, the average gap between investment in climate mitigation measures in 2023 and the sums required between 2024 and 2030 to align to a net zero pathway was USD5.9tn (a range of USD4.5tn to USD7.8tn).

For the first time, private climate finance contributions exceeded USD1tn in 2023, outpacing public investment.

As policy support for climate objectives and official development assistance decreases across the world, directing dwindling resources to where they are most needed is essential to support the energy transition. In the U.S., the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has rolled back several provisions of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including eliminating a number of tax credits that had underpinned clean energy investment. In the European Union, fiscal pressures and shifting policy priorities pose a challenge to the implementation of environmental policies. At the same time, heightened geopolitical tensions and growing defense demands are intensifying competition for government spending, diverting resources that might otherwise have been directed toward climate and development goals.

This study highlights where policymakers, governments, and investors can focus their efforts to align capital flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Investment in physical assets is needed, as is continued support for enabling activities such as information-sharing and climate science research.

Failing to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation measures will exacerbate expected economic, social, and environmental damage from rising global temperatures and more extreme weather events. It will also mean communities will not gain from associated benefits such as enhanced food security, greater energy efficiency, and improved health outcomes.

Global trends

To keep the world on a net zero pathway, investment in climate mitigation measures must rise to between USD6.2tn and USD9.5tn (USD7.6tn on average) per year by 2030.

This leaves an annual gap of USD4.5tn to USD7.8tn (USD5.9tn on average) compared to 2023 climate mitigation investment of USD1.7tn . For the period 2031 to 50, this investment needs range increases to USD6.9tn to USD11.3tn (USD9tn on average).

Achieving the required investment levels appears increasingly within reach. If global climate finance flows continue to rise at the current five-year CAGR of 18% (2018 to 2023), investment could meet the lower boundary of estimated climate finance needs by 2032. At the faster three-year CAGR of 26% (2020 to 2023), this could be achieved by 2029. However, each year of delay causes the financing gap to grow.

This year's analysis, for the first time, breaks down the investment gap by the development status of nations across all major sectors. No region is currently achieving the climate investment required to stay on a net zero pathway. The gap is widest in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs, excluding China), where investment needs are 8.3 times higher than 2023 climate finance flows. This is approximately twice the gap that exists in advanced economies (4.8 times 2023 flows). However, in absolute terms, climate finance flows need to grow more in advanced economies, with an additional USD2.9tn required annually from 2024-2030 compared to 2023 investment levels.

Climate investment is highest in advanced economies and China, while EMDE regions such as the Middle East, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa remain significantly underfunded. A handful of EMDEs (excluding China) are seeing an uptick in climate finance flows, driven by investment in clean energy (predominantly small-scale solar), as well as the transport and buildings sectors (CPI, 2025). EMDEs (excluding China) require an estimated USD2.3tn of climate finance annually between now and 2030, rising to USD2.8tn from 2031-2050. This constitutes 30% of global investment needs.

China accounts for 21% of global climate finance needs between 2024 and 2030, dropping slightly to 20% between 2031 and 2050. An average of USD1.6tn is required annually in China between 2024 and 2030, rising to USD1.7tn between 2031 and 2050.

Advanced economies account for roughly half of global climate finance needs (49% in 2024-2030 and 50% in 2031-2050), requiring USD3.7tn and USD4.5tn respectively.

Sectoral trends

Energy systems received more climate mitigation investment in 2023 (USD794bn, 45% of all climate finance flows) than any other sector, but interestingly, also have the highest financing gap of USD2.1tn per year between 2024 and 2030 compared to 2023 levels. This figure rises slightly to USD2.2tn per year between 2031 and 2050.

The second-highest climate finance flows in 2023 involved the transport sector, totaling USD540bn (30% of global climate mitigation investment). Like energy systems, the investment needed to transition transport is significant (USD1.9tn annually between 2024 and 2030), an almost 2.5-fold increase on current climate finance flows. However, this investment could help to realize the sector's mitigation potential of GtCO2e per year by 2030.

Climate investment priorities include electrification of private road transport, public transport expansion, and freight decarbonization. Estimates for investment needs in electrifying transport vary, but low-emission vehicles could require an average of USD2.4tn per year between 2024 and 2030.

More climate finance is required for transport in Western Europe than any other sector (37% of the region's needs between 2024 and 2030).

Regional investment gaps in transport show a higher variability than for energy systems. Global climate finance needs for the transport sector are 3.5 times current climate finance flows, but investment would need to increase by between 26 and 38 times in the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The transport sector will require USD2.6tn in annual climate mitigation investment between 2031 and 2050, a 41% increase from 2024-2030 levels. This represents the largest rise in investment needs for any sector.

The third-highest climate finance flows in 2023 (USD340bn) involved the buildings and infrastructure sector. However, the sector requires an average of USD1.1tn in climate investment between 2024 and 2030, meaning mitigation finance will need to rise more than threefold to close the gap and unlock its 3 GtCO2e mitigation potential.

Focus areas include scaling of low-carbon heating and cooking (which will require USD880bn annually between 2024 and 2030), and energy-efficient retrofits (USD630bn annually between 2024 and 2030).

Buildings and infrastructure require the most climate mitigation investment as a proportion of total climate finance in Central Asia and Eastern Europe (26% of regional needs), the Middle East and North Africa (23%), and Western Europe (22%).

The relative net zero financing gap is greatest in the Middle East and North Africa, where investment needs are 13 times greater than 2023 investment flows.

Overall, the sector will require USD1.4tn in climate finance on average between 2031 and 2050, an increase of 27% on 2024-2030 levels, driven primarily by the need for low-carbon heating and cooling systems.

The industry sector received USD27bn in climate mitigation investment in 2023, the second-lowest total in our study. Compared to current flows, meeting the USD590bn annual net zero financing gap would require a nearly 22-fold increase in climate finance flows. With the simultaneous decrease in high-carbon activities, this sectoral transformation could unlock 4 GtCO2e in annual abatement potential by 2030—higher than that of transport or buildings and infrastructure.

Key areas include low-emission production of aluminum, cement, steel, ammonia, and other chemicals, as well as carbon capture and storage.

Despite having the lowest investment needs across all regions, there are some geographic disparities. The industry sector requires around USD100bn in mitigation investment annually in China between 2024 and 2030 and USD122bn in South and Southeast Asia (16% of regional needs) over the same period.

The global net zero financing gap in the industry sector is 22 times 2023 climate finance flows. The gap varies from seven times current climate finance flows in Western Europe to 48 times in China.

Between 2031 and 2050, industry will require USD650bn in annual mitigation investment, a 10% increase on the period between 2024 and 2030.

The agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU) sector offers a climate mitigation potential second only to the energy sector (8 GtCO2e per year by 2030). However, to realize this, climate finance flows need to increase 60-fold from USD19bn in 2023 to an annual average of USD1.2tn in the period between 2024 and 2030.

Policy support and capacity building will be central to the sector's transition, accounting for 40% of climate finance needs between 2024 and 2030.The development of sustainable crops and livestock practices will also require substantial support (28%).

Forest and biodiversity conservation is crucial, with 74% of AFOLU's mitigation potential linked to transforming forest-related activities and developing carbon sinks.

AFOLU investment needs increase by a modest 7% between 2024 to 2030 and 2031 to 2050, demonstrating the urgent need for immediate investment. Delaying action until after 2030 will be insufficient to meet sectoral and climate goals.

Recent policy developments

2024

Preliminary estimates suggest that climate finance flows increased by around 8% in 2024, surpassing USD2tn for the first time. While these projections are encouraging, they are lower than the 15% increase recorded between 2022 and 2023. The transport sector remains the largest driver, buoyed by demand for EVs and supporting infrastructure.

This resilience is notable considering headwinds that likely slowed momentum.

Macroeconomic conditions: interest rates, which were raised sharply over the 2022-2023 period, and remained high for much of 2024, have raised the cost of capital. The effects were particularly pronounced in EMDEs due to their higher reliance on external borrowing and vulnerability to currency fluctuations. The increase in U.S. interest rates typically elevates debt servicing costs for EMDEs with dollar-denominated liabilities. This scenario exacerbates existing debt burdens, and discourages capital inflows.

Energy market dynamics: lower gas prices and higher electricity costs over the same period dampened heat pump sales in Europe.

Grid bottlenecks: rapid renewable deployment outpaced infrastructure capacity, leaving 1,650 GW of solar and wind awaiting connection worldwide.

Despite surpassing the USD2tn milestone, the slowdown in growth suggests that the net zero investment gap could widen further in the coming years unless immediate global action is taken to accelerate climate investments across all regions and sectors.

2025

Global clean energy investment in 2025 shows early signs of resilience to policy shifts and tighter market conditions, with offshore wind and small-scale solar driving an increase in renewables investment in the first half of the year.

In the United States, however, growth in renewable spending is set to level off as federal support eases, with knock-on effects for international capital flows to EMDEs.

At the same time, higher interest rates, supply chain pressures, and evolving regulatory frameworks are likely to heighten investor caution. With aid budgets under pressure and geopolitical priorities reshaping development policy, development finance institutions (DFIs) face growing pressure to ""do more with less"".

This is likely to accelerate the use of innovative financial instruments and catalytic approaches to maximize limited resources. The International Finance Corporation's recent inaugural securitization transaction exemplifies this approach, setting a new model for attracting institutional private capital into EMDEs.

Climate-related financial regulation and commitments are facing mounting legal and political challenges. In the United States, financial institutions have faced litigation over their participation in net-zero and ESG initiatives, prompting a wave of exits from voluntary climate alliances. The Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) has announced it will cease operations following a vote to dissolve the group, having already lost numerous members due to claims by some U.S. lawmakers that participation violated antitrust laws.

At the same time, global climate litigation risk continues to grow. While the full impact of these developments remains uncertain, they risk slowing the pace of portfolio decarbonization as financial institutions navigate conflicting regulatory pressures and political challenges.

Despite evolving federal policy frameworks, some U.S. states continue to advance climate agendas. Following California's 2023 model, New York and Colorado have adopted emissions disclosure requirements, alongside renewable energy targets and net zero commitments.

This state-level regulatory environment has helped maintain the attractiveness of net zero investments, even while some renewable infrastructure companies take legal action against the federal government over cancelled projects.

For example, Iberdrola allocated a significant portion of its three-year investment plan to the U.S. and UK markets, with executive chair Ignacio Galán citing state-regulated electricity networks as a key factor in the U.S. market's appeal. Additionally, focus on data center capacity—driven by the expansion of artificial intelligence—is accelerating investment in clean energy infrastructure, particularly geothermal and nuclear. Major technology companies are securing long-term renewable energy agreements, further reinforcing sector growth.

Outside the U.S., global climate policy momentum has shown resilience through multilateral initiatives and regulatory frameworks. In March, for example, Germany and Japan reinforced Indonesia's USD20bn Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) following the withdrawal of the U.S., ensuring the continuation of the coal-to-clean-energy transition plan. The proliferation of climate policies worldwide provides a buffer against individual country rollbacks. Even if regulatory requirements fluctuate in certain countries following political and business cycles, companies operating internationally are still likely to encounter increasing global climate disclosure obligations. Despite this progress, significant gaps remain between current ambition and policy implementation to meet global climate targets.

A slowdown in U.S. clean technology deployment could create opportunities for other major economies such as China, India, and Brazil, to capture greater market share in both production and investment. China already dominates the global manufacture of key technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and EVs, while Brazil and India are rapidly scaling renewable investment and could emerge as significant exporters by 2035. With clean technology accounting for 10% of global GDP growth in 2023, and the global clean tech market projected to exceed USD2tn by 2035, reduced U.S. leadership could accelerate the rise of alternative suppliers.

Conclusion

Climate finance has reached record levels, but slowing economic growth and rising geopolitical and economic headwinds risk widening the net zero investment gap. To meet global climate goals, recent momentum needs to be sustained and in certain sectors and scaled further. This will not happen without deliberate action.

This study identifies where action can deliver the greatest impact, offering guidance to policymakers, investors, and governments. By making this data and analysis publicly available, we aim to sharpen focus on both the urgency of the challenge and the scale of the opportunity, helping to guide decisions that will help keep net zero within reach.

A hiring drive was held earlier this year for the gigafactory, and continues to hire for positions, bringing a vast employment boost to St. Thomas, a town with just 43,000 residents.
""The excitement in St. Thomas is palpable, as we celebrate this monumental construction milestone,"" said Preston of the ground breaking last month.
""The St. Thomas gigafactory is rapidly coming to life and already delivering on its promise of prosperity — supporting hundreds of local jobs and providing a significant boost to our economy right here in our community.""
The outlook for the short term is pretty bleak, and the federal government's budget presented in November 2025 has already been met with criticism from the auto sector.","A gargantuan Volkswagen ""gigafactory"" recently kicked off construction in Ontario, throwing a potential lifeline to a regional auto industry pushed to the brink by U.S. trade tariffs.

Workers mobilized on the sprawling 350-acre site of the future $7 billion Volkswagen PowerCo facility in St. Thomas, Ont., in late October, launching construction work for the colossal new electric vehicle battery plant with an official ground breaking celebration.

The Oct. 28 ground breaking — which included the first concrete pours for the new facility — marked the first major step in the plant's journey towards a projected 2027 completion.

Frank Blome, CEO of PowerCo SE, called October's ground breaking ""a big milestone,"" and stated the project is ""positioning Canada at the forefront of innovative EV battery production.""

The plant was first announced back in March 2023, and is being billed as Canada's largest electric vehicle battery plant, as well as PowerCo's (a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group) third-largest project globally.

The project's importance to Ontario's struggling auto sector is as immense as the building's footprint. That value has only grown since March 2025, when U.S. President Donald Trump began to roll out harsh tariffs on Canadian industries.

Much of the province's auto sector is built around manufacturing for U.S. car brands, though the construction of major infrastructure to support European car manufacturers allows Ontario to tap into a new tariff-exempt sector of the auto market.

And with a projected 3,000 workers to be employed directly by the plant — not even factoring in the construction jobs to build the new facility — the battery factory stands to be a huge contributor to manufacturing jobs in the region.

A hiring drive was held earlier this year for the gigafactory, and continues to hire for positions, bringing a vast employment boost to St. Thomas, a town with just 43,000 residents.

At the time of the hiring drive's launch earlier this year, St. Thomas Mayor Joe Preston said the investment ""isn't just an economic boost; it's a fundamental transformation for our community.""

""We're proud to be the home for this exciting new chapter in Canada's burgeoning EV battery manufacturing sector,"" said Preston back in August.

It was just over two months later that shovels would hit the ground for the new plant, ushering in a new era for the small Ontario town.

""The excitement in St. Thomas is palpable, as we celebrate this monumental construction milestone,"" said Preston of the ground breaking last month.

""The St. Thomas gigafactory is rapidly coming to life and already delivering on its promise of prosperity — supporting hundreds of local jobs and providing a significant boost to our economy right here in our community.""

And the timing really couldn't be better for an industry in a tough position. The outlook for the short term is pretty bleak, and the federal government's budget presented in November 2025 has already been met with criticism from the auto sector.

The completed facility — set to open in less than two years — will serve as the North American base for PowerCo's advanced battery technology, offering some balance to the job losses and factory closures that could be on the horizon for manufacturers working assembly lines for U.S. auto brands.",https://blogto-production2-baselayer-display.blogto.com/articles/20251114-gigafactory-ontario-volkswagen.jpg?w=1200&cmd=resize_then_crop&height=630&quality=70&format=jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 12:02:56.782628

Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago.

Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources.
Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services.","Globally, energy-related investments are set to reach USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, according to the IEA’s latest World Energy Investment 2025 report. Around USD 2.2 trillion is expected to go collectively towards renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, efficiency and the electrification of end-use sectors, with USD 1.1 trillion going to oil, gas and coal.

This analysis, prepared jointly by the IEA and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), dives further into the latest data. It examines energy investment trends in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) since 2015, highlighting investment opportunities for the region as countries look to support economic growth, enhance energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring energy affordability and access.

Latin America has some of the world’s best solar, wind and hydro resources, and it is a pioneer in the development of biofuels and renewable power. Leveraging these assets, the region has seen clean energy investment grow by 25% since 2015. Spending on renewables, grids, energy efficiency and electrification are on course to increase to about USD 70 billion in 2025.

Fossil fuel resources are unevenly distributed across the region; some countries are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, while others are major exporters. Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago. This year’s fossil fuel investment is expected to be about 20% lower than in 2015.

Overall, energy investment in the region is projected to reach USD 160 billion in 2025. This would be around 7% lower than a decade earlier, though this can be explained in part by cost declines over this period, both for both for upstream oil and gas activities as well as for key clean energy technologies.

Fifteen countries1 in the region have pledged to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. Meanwhile, a slightly different group of 15 LAC countries2 have put forward new Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement with targets for 2035. Across the region, meeting announced energy and climate targets would require a significant acceleration in investment in low-emissions power generation, grids and storage, low-emissions fuels, energy efficiency and the electrification of end-uses. Based on today’s policy settings, annual clean energy investments would exceed USD 110 billion by 2035, rising by 60% from current levels. However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025. Investments in EVs would need the largest amounts of additional capital, with investment needs for energy efficiency and electrification nearly quadrupling and accounting for about 45% of end-use investments in 2035.

Grids in particular will need a boost in spending; as with many other regions, spending on distribution and transmission have not kept up with the rapid growth in solar and wind capacity. Today, for each dollar spent on new power generation in the region, less than USD 0.50 is spent on grids and storage. By 2035, this needs to reach about USD 0.85, with total spending on grids and storage reaching nearly USD 50 billion under the APS.

As energy transitions in LAC accelerate under the APS, investments in fossil fuels decline, reaching about 50% of 2015 levels by 2035. Total spending on fossil fuels drops by over USD 30 billion by then, with much of this reduction offset by a sharp increase in investments in low-emissions fuels, which rise to nearly five times current levels.

Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources. Northern Chile and Western Argentina have high-quality solar radiation, while the “Southern Cone”3 and Northern Colombia offer highly productive wind corridors. Brazil has well-established bioenergy and sustainable fuel industries, along with most of the continent’s installed capacity in distributed solar, utility-scale solar and wind generation. Capacity across these categories is also expanding in Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay. In the Caribbean, countries are exploring solar, storage and hybrid projects to reduce fossil fuel dependence and increase energy security. These are very much in line with the ambitious targets adopted in the region: Barbados seeks to establish a 100% renewable power mix by 2035, and Antigua and Barbuda aims to source one-third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. And many other countries, including Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia and Dominica, have policies in place to support significant decarbonisation efforts in the coming decade.

For the moment, the region receives only 5% of global private investment in clean energy, compared with 8% of private sector spending on fossil fuels. There are, however, multiple examples from across LAC that show how a clear vision for energy transitions and a willingness to engage with the private sector can produce results.

Across two auctions in 2024, Brazil raised nearly USD 4 billion to build almost 7 300 kilometres (km) of new transmission lines. In October 2025, another auction was successfully held for the construction and operation of more than 1 000 km of new lines. These investments, which aim to strengthen the grid, integrate more renewable energy and improve system reliability, show how competitive auctions can attract private capital for major infrastructure projects.

In Argentina, the first large-scale auction (AlmaGBA) for a battery energy storage system (BESS) targeted the installation of 500 megawatts (MW) of capacity in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. The market responded strongly, with over 1 300 MW in bids and a final allocation of around 660 MW. The programme focused on congested areas and enabled greater renewable integration.

In Honduras, energy storage is being used to stabilise the electricity system in regions where renewable expansion is limited by transmission capacity and variability, showing that flexibility solutions are spreading across the region beyond large electricity markets. The National Electricity Company (ENEE) launched an international tender in 2025 to contract 1 500 MW of firm capacity to secure electricity supply through 2030. At least 65% of capacity must come from renewables with storage under a multi-round reverse auction and a Build-Operate-Transfer scheme with contracts of about 15 years.

This year, the Dominican Republic, through its National Energy Commission (CNE) and the Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company (EGEHID), also launched an international tender for up to 600 MW of new renewable capacity with mandatory storage, with the aim of diversifying the country’s energy mix, reducing fossil fuel dependence and achieving 30% renewable generation by 2030 under long-term power purchase agreements spanning from 15 to 20 years.

In Chile, a strong regulatory framework is in place that encourages battery integration and transmission improvements as renewable penetration grows.

Overall, these initiatives show that countries across the region are actively fostering conditions for further growth in energy investment, particularly amid their shift toward more resilient, flexible and renewable energy-focused power systems.

Regional energy integration is a key tool to harmonise planning, facilitate decision-making and enable the development of larger-scale projects. In line with this objective, OLADE created in 2024 a Regional Energy Planning Council, whose goal is to act as a regional coordination platform that identifies opportunities for integration and promotes a common energy agenda by helping energy ministers share information, reach agreements and align national planning efforts. The broader aim is to speed up the energy transition in Latin America and the Caribbean by exchanging best practices and creating better conditions through coordinated sustainable energy policies and market integration across the region.

Another critical element is the implementation of stable frameworks for renewable energy auctions and contracts. Recent experiences in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Honduras show that competitive auctions and long-term contracts provide certainty to developers and reduce financial costs for investors. OLADE’s Regional Regulatory Convergence initiative reinforces this principle by promoting the harmonization of criteria and contracting practices that encourage cross-border and regional investment.

National incentives and regulations have an important role to play. For example, Brazil’s Fuel of the Future Law, passed in late 2024, could unlock around USD 4 billion per year in investments for sustainable fuels, including green diesel, biogas and sustainable aviation fuel. The law sets mandatory blending targets, carbon intensity mandates and incentives to expand biofuels, supporting the country’s energy transition and attracting private capital to the sector.

The availability of instruments to mitigate currency risk and public guarantees is another key factor in attracting foreign investment, while the expansion and digitalisation of electricity grids also serves as an essential enabler to unlock investments in distributed generation and large-scale renewables. Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services. As elsewhere in the world, robust energy planning in LAC remains central to creating a strong enabling environment for investments in a secure, affordable and sustainable energy future.

The G20 Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries, developed by the IEA for Brazil’s G20 Presidency in 2024, identifies opportunities and actions to help achieve a rapid scaling up of clean energy investments. The roadmap outlines specific, timebound steps for increasing private financing in order to mobilise the investments required across different regions and sectors to build modern, clean energy systems.

WV announces more than $4B in energy investments in past month

West Virginia Office of Governor – Patrick Morrisey

Governor Patrick Morrisey announced that West Virginia secured nearly $4.2 billion in private-sector energy investments and more than 4,200 new jobs in under a month, asserting the state as a dominant force in American energy. Key projects include a $2.5 billion natural gas power plant creating 3,200 construction jobs, $1.44 billion to extend the life of six coal-fired plants, and a $1.2 billion gas-fired plant in Harrison County. These announcements support the Governor’s “50 by 50” initiative, which aims to increase baseload generation to 50 GW by 2050. The nearly $4.2 billion secured required only a minimal $1 million, repayable state contribution, showcasing the state’s success in attracting investment without major taxpayer funding. [MDN: WV is making aggressive moves to expand energy production. Hats off to Gov. Morrisey for his leadership in making this happen.]

NY Climate Act fork in the road

Pragmatic Environmentalist of New York/Roger Caiazza

The article argues that New York’s Climate Act mandates have reached a “fork in the road,” demanding legislative revision due to issues of infeasibility, affordability, and grid reliability. This conclusion is primarily supported by a recent New York Supreme Court decision, which ordered the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to either issue final greenhouse gas regulations or ask the Legislature to change the 2030 reduction mandate, as the State itself deemed compliance “currently infeasible.” State analyses, including the Draft Energy Plan and Comptroller Audit, further highlight critical deficiencies, escalating costs, and the likelihood of missing clean energy goals due to transmission inadequacies and other technical obstacles. The author urges the Legislature to modify the law, coupling a revised schedule with clearly defined, trackable standards for affordability and reliability. [MDN: How about the legislature canceling the idiotic Climate Act? That would be the smartest thing to do.]

Hochul enrages environmentalists with shift to ‘all of the above’ energy policy

POLITICO/Marie J. French, Mona Zhang

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has enacted a “monumental pivot” on energy policy, moving away from her previous climate-forward agenda, citing concerns over energy affordability and grid reliability ahead of a tough re-election bid. The governor recently approved a new gas pipeline and settled a lawsuit to keep the gas-fueled Greenidge cryptocurrency miner operating for five more years. This shift has ignited “outrage” from the progressive environmental wing of her party, leading three major climate groups to endorse her primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado. Hochul defends the “all-of-the-above” approach, claiming it is necessary to govern in reality amid rising costs and grid warnings, reflecting a national trend among moderate Democrats prioritizing near-term economic concerns over aggressive climate targets. [MDN: Hochul has always been and continues to be a sleazy leftist politician. But she’s not stupid. She sees that the policies she has created won’t work, and she wants to get reelected. Hence, this “monumental pivot” on energy policy. The best thing NY can do is elect Elise Stefanik next year as governor to replace the failed Hochul.]

Mike Kennealy calls for review of Massachusetts’ green energy programs

Boston (MA) Herald/Tim Dunn

Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy has called for an independent review of all green energy programs and climate spending in Massachusetts, blaming Governor Maura Healey’s policies, such as blocking gas pipelines, for contributing to the state’s high energy costs. Kennealy argues that the pursuit of the 2050 net-zero emissions mandate is prioritizing ideology over affordability and reliability, urging cuts to policies driving up utility bills for families and businesses. Concurrently, legislation is moving on Beacon Hill to roll back green energy spending, including the net-zero mandate, and redirect the Mass Save program’s focus to cost-effectiveness, drawing support from small businesses but criticism from climate activists. Governor Healey has also filed her own legislation aiming to lower energy costs by reducing state mandates and strengthening energy independence. [MDN: Healey is the problem in Massachusetts. She must go. Mike Kennealy is the solution to lower energy prices in the Bay State.]

Natural gas prices hit highest level since invasion of Ukraine

Wall Street Journal/Ryan Dezember

The onset of cold weather and record-breaking Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports have driven U.S. natural-gas prices to their highest levels since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This surge, with December futures hitting $4.646 per million British thermal units—up 67% from a year ago—benefits U.S. drillers who suffered from a supply glut last year. However, these higher costs threaten to increase heating bills for the roughly 61 million American homes warmed by natural gas, plus the many more powered by gas-generated electricity. The rise is largely attributed to a sustained, record pace of LNG export activity, primarily to European allies, which is more than offsetting the near-record domestic production pace, despite ample storage levels heading into the winter. [MDN: It certainly is a balancing act. We like a higher natgas price, but we don’t want it so high that consumers suffer and gas-fired power turns to coal-fired power.]

Six US states to watch as rising gas prices drive a coal comeback

Reuters/Gavin Maguire

A significant rise in U.S. natural gas costs in 2025 has spurred utilities to reverse the multi-year trend of declining coal use, opting to boost coal-fired electricity generation to curb consumer bills. Benchmark natural gas futures, up 44% from last year, averaged $3.57 per million British thermal units, making coal, which is approximately 20% cheaper, the preferred fuel. Through the first seven months of the year, national coal output rose by about 16%, while gas generation dropped by 4%. This cost-saving shift is most prominent in six states—Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina, and Wisconsin—which collectively saw a 26% increase in coal burning.

Chevron sees oil prices under ‘more pressure’ than LNG next year

Bloomberg/K. Crowley, K. Greifeld, R. Bostick

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth predicts that increased oil supply from OPEC+ nations will continue to pressure crude prices next year, making 2026 prices likely to feel more pressure than LNG. Following its correct prediction of this year’s oil price drop, Chevron unveiled a five-year plan prioritizing profitability over production growth through 2030, aiming for 14% annual free cash flow growth with $70/barrel crude. While Chevron expects strong global demand for liquefied natural gas, Wirth anticipates lower LNG spot prices at the end of the 2020s due to a supply surge from the Gulf Coast and Middle East, potentially exceeding demand.

Crude settles higher

Bloomberg/M. Gindis, A. Longley, W. Kubzansky

Oil prices rebounded slightly, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for December rising 0.34% to settle at $58.69 a barrel and Brent for January rising 0.3% to settle at $63.01 a barrel, despite strong evidence of a looming record surplus. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projected supply will exceed demand by over four million barrels a day in 2026, a deteriorating outlook reinforced by a large 6.4 million barrel rise in US crude inventories. This oversupply concern, which has pushed a key price indicator into contango, contrasts with supply risks from new US sanctions on Russian energy firms like Rosneft and Lukoil. Prices also found support in signs of resilient global consumption, indicated by falling product inventories and rising exports. Even though OPEC+ plans to pause production hikes in early 2026, a significant market surplus is still widely expected.

This year’s UN climate summit in Brazil, COP30, is a green flop

Legal Insurrection/Leslie Eastman

The recent COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, hosted by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was characterized as a “green flop” due to the lowest turnout of world leaders in four years, with only 31 heads of state attending. This poor attendance coincided with President Donald Trump’s declaration that the climate crisis is “dead” and his continued reversal of climate policies, which angered some participating leftist leaders. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attended to contrast with Trump’s absence and promote California’s (failed) efforts. The summit highlighted a clash of ideologies, with host Lula strongly condemning “climate denialism” and stressing the urgency of the crisis (and the need for you to give them your money), while the article asserts that these annual conferences are losing their luster and legitimacy. [MDN: COP30 was a big-time floparoono. Only “B” listers like Greasy Gavin attended. He makes your skin crawl. Nobody is buying the hoax anymore, which angers leftists.]

Paris Climate Accord’s demise—James Hansen was right

Institute for Energy Research/Robert L. Bradley, Jr.

The article asserts that the Paris Climate Agreement is a failure, evidenced by almost all major signatories being out of compliance with their emissions reduction pledges, including the U.S. and Russia. This demise was predicted by climate scientist James Hansen, who called the 2015 accord a “fraud” and “worthless words,” arguing that as long as fossil fuels remain the cheapest option, they will continue to be burned. Hansen also dismissed the idea that renewables could rapidly phase out fossil fuels. The commentary concludes it is time to repeal the agreement and Net Zero, advocating for adaptation and stating that a high-energy civilization, which relies on fossil fuels, is the true driver of climate livability. [MDN: More brilliant insights from Robert Bradley about the nonsensical Paris agreement. It was stupid then and it’s stupid now. We’re glad Trump has removed the U.S. from participating.

Utility-scale renewable projects are waiting years for approval to hook in, but distributed solar skips that step entirely.
Ron Celentano, president of the Pennsylvania Solar & Storage Industries Association, thinks it has high potential.
“I tend to push hard on [distributed solar], because it’s often a missed opportunity in a lot of areas,” Celentano said.
Solar advocates dispute that.","In Carlisle, a sleepy town in the heart of Pennsylvania Trump country, solar energy appears to have escaped the black hole of partisan politics. Or at least, that’s been the experience of Carlisle Area School District superintendent Colleen Friend, who has met little resistance spearheading a project to install a solar array about the size of a football field at a local elementary school.

The project is itself the beneficiary of a political anomaly, the $25 million “Solar for Schools” initiative. The bill that created it last year made it through Pennsylvania’s divided state government even though basically nothing else on energy policy has reached the governor’s desk in recent years.

It also remains one of the few policy bright spots for clean energy advocates in the state budget deal struck on Wednesday, which saw the program re-upped for another year, even as Democratic leadership agreed to exit a potentially paradigm-shifting regional carbon cap-and-trade program.

Friend isn’t surprised that Solar for Schools proved a survivor in a budget battle that dragged on for months. The bill signing ceremony in Harrisburg last year was “very bipartisan,” she said. Her school district received $252,000 in funding for the ongoing project, and Friend now plans to apply for more.

“We already know the next building we’re going to put a solar array at,” she said.

But does distributed solar—the diffuse installation of small-scale arrays on the roofs and lawns of homes, businesses and municipal buildings—present a wider bipartisan opportunity to move climate policy forward in the acrimonious world of Pennsylvania politics?

Long a fossil fuel juggernaut with bountiful reserves of coal and gas, Pennsylvania at one point was also considered an innovator on renewable energy. But it has since fallen into position as a national laggard. Fights over fracking and former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s move to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the interstate cap-and-trade program known as RGGI, had ground down any progress in the space to next to nothing.

On paper, distributed solar appears to have breakthrough potential. Solar for Schools’ wide bipartisan support last year followed what advocates describe as a herculean effort by its sponsor, state Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler. The Philadelphia Democrat and chair of the House Energy Committee toured the state to discuss its opportunities, focusing on economic benefits and reaching across the aisle.

Flora Cardoni, deputy director of the nonprofit PennEnvironment, helped champion the program and said it proved to be a rousing success in its first year, with 88 applications requesting $88 million in funding, more than three times what the budget allowed. Ultimately, 73 schools were awarded a total of $22.6 million in May.

“There’s clear demand, that more schools applied for the Solar for Schools grants than were able to receive an award,” Cardoni said. “We would just love to see even more schools follow their lead.”

Distributed solar also stands to benefit from deregulatory policy, a potential attraction for conservatives. Among five energy-related statehouse bills packaged under Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s “Lightning Plan,” the one that promises to adjust regulations to facilitate “community energy” projects—picture neighbors subscribing to a local communal solar array—has garnered the most bipartisan support.

Distributed solar can also avoid perhaps the biggest hurdle to solar development in Pennsylvania at present: the backed-up queue of grid operator PJM Interconnection, which oversees large, utility-scale energy development. Utility-scale renewable projects are waiting years for approval to hook in, but distributed solar skips that step entirely.

Ron Celentano, president of the Pennsylvania Solar & Storage Industries Association, thinks it has high potential. He points to a 2018 analysis by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that found rooftop solar could account for 10 percent to 35 percent of all solar power in the state by 2030, if lawmakers enact solar-friendly policies.

“I tend to push hard on [distributed solar], because it’s often a missed opportunity in a lot of areas,” Celentano said.

And yet, advocates wonder how much ground can be covered, especially in light of the new budget agreement. Cardoni believes that RGGI could have generated about $1 billion annually for Pennsylvania to invest in clean energy technologies while forcing a market shift toward renewables, an impact that dwarfs an additional $25 million slated for the second year of Solar for Schools.

In the lead-up to the budget breakthrough, advocates had also heard that Lightning Plan bills could be part of the negotiations. But in the end, there was nothing to suggest that any of them, including the community energy bill, would be brought up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.

“We would need to get a lot of policies like that passed to make up for RGGI in terms of carbon reduction,” Cardoni said.

And even the calculus behind Solar for Schools is shifting. Advocates say that many school districts had planned to combine state grant money with federal financial incentives covering another 30 percent to 50 percent of costs, depending on demographic factors. But those credits are now scheduled to expire next year after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolled them back.

With a deadline to start construction looming next summer, Celentano said that timelines are getting tight for school districts to go through bidding and design, never mind finding a contractor in the midst of a rush.

Adding to the problem is what Celentano said are delays at Pennsylvania electric utilities such as PECO and PPL, which have their own waiting lines for applicants seeking to connect rooftop solar and other similarly sized ground arrays to the grid. PECO did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokesperson for PPL confirmed that approval for larger examples of such projects may take “one to three years, depending on complexity.”

“We remain committed to processing interconnection applications as quickly and efficiently as possible,” PPL spokesperson Dana Burns wrote in an email, adding that the utility is “actively working to minimize delays and prioritize transparency and communication with applicants.”

No schools districts have yet announced abandoning their plans, but Celentano said some clients have asked him to run new analyses on what costs will be without federal tax credits. He predicts many projects wouldn’t survive a scenario in which they lose up to half of their funding via federal incentives, and the impact on interest for a second year of funding remains unknown.

“There’s a little bit of concern to some of these schools: Are we going to make it?” Celentano said.

Bipartisan Opportunities

On paper, distributed solar has political potential across red and blue counties in Pennsylvania. In a September report analyzing the first year of Solar for Schools, PennEnvironment calculated that approximately 5,000 schools across the commonwealth have the physical capacity to install solar. Collectively, they would save a potential $342 million over the lifetime of the systems, while powering the equivalent of 187,000 homes and reducing carbon emissions by the equivalent of 300,000 cars.

“The rooftops of Pennsylvania’s roughly 5,000 schools are often flat and unshaded, making them excellent sites for solar panels,” the report noted.

What’s more, rural counties, with their often-abundant space, stand to benefit considerably. PennEnvironment calculated that Lancaster County, quintessential home of the Pennsylvania Dutch, had the second highest cost-savings potential, after Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County. And while the nonprofit found that the 20 counties that stand to save the most in total are the most populated, it is mostly rural counties that would save the most per school.

“That just speaks to the vast savings potential,” Cardoni said.

The 2018 Department of Environmental Protection solar potential report calculated that distributed solar would also employ more people than large “grid-scale” arrays, at about 3 to 5 jobs per megawatt hour installed, compared to less than 2.5 jobs.

In a high-end scenario where 35 percent of the state’s solar mix came from rooftop arrays, the analysis predicted the creation of more than 32,000 total jobs. That’s about triple the current number employed in Pennsylvania’s waning coal industry.

Fiedler, the Solar for Schools sponsor, said she leaned into the economic benefits of solar and sought the support of labor unions as she traveled across the commonwealth stumping for the program. It worked: In final votes on the legislation last year, 10 of 101 House Republicans and 21 of 28 Republican senators joined all Democrats in voting yes.

“We think as individual households the bills that we get are high,” Fiedler said. “And they are, they’re going up. But for school districts it’s even more—add a couple of zeros on the end.”

Jim Gregory, a former three-term Republican state representative who is now executive director of the Pennsylvania Conservative Energy Network, said he also makes economic and reliability arguments when lobbying his former colleagues on supporting renewable energy. He believes the political gridlock on energy will have to give way soon, given dramatically escalating electricity rates for consumers in the state. He’s pitching solar as an important and quickly scalable option within an “all of the above” energy strategy, with the ability to take “pressure” off fossil fuel supplies.

“We can’t continue to do nothing. … The pain is going to overcome the fear that people have of a pipeline in their backyard on the Left, or a solar field on the farmer’s property next to theirs in rural Pennsylvania,” Gregory said.

But it’s not clear how much wider bipartisan support for solar truly exists in the legislature. Some efforts this year seem to have stalled out.

Democratic State Rep. Peter Schweyer’s community energy bill passed the House in May by a 114-89 margin, with more Republican support than Solar for Schools received. But the bill has remained in a Senate committee ever since, with no signs of movement even in the wake of a budget deal.

Democratic State Rep. Robert Merski, meanwhile, introduced a measure to put solar on municipal buildings like firehouses. But that legislation has remained stuck in a House committee since January.

And the cross-party coalition on these issues appears somewhat fragile.

State Rep. Craig Williams, a Republican from Delaware County in the Philadelphia suburbs, voted for both Solar for Schools and the community energy bill and said he believes there is a dire need to adjust state energy policy in the midst of rapidly rising costs.

“I’m trying to work across the aisle to get any form of generation online that’s clean and sustainable,” Williams said, adding he finds geothermal and nuclear particularly promising.

But Williams, a former PECO assistant general counsel, has also at times proved a thorn in the side of solar advocates, introducing amendments to legislation that they fear could negatively impact net metering, the way that owners of distributed solar panels receive financial compensation from utilities.

Williams said he thinks the current compensation system unfairly increases costs for non-solar owners, an issue utilities have also raised to state regulators. Solar advocates dispute that. Celentano said he’s pressed for evidence of such a cost shift, “and they can never show us the data.”

For Williams, discussions about advancing solar and community-generation policies are also part of an all-of-the-above strategy. He wants to see Democrats move off long-held positions against bringing new fossil fuel power plants online, citing concerns about power demand outstripping supply.

“There is a tremendous opportunity if we can get out of our own way,” Williams said.

What Next?

Numerous advocates said they believe Fiedler’s Solar for Schools program has benefited from a unique combination of her persistent efforts, fortunate timing and the non-controversial nature of saving school districts money. One former clean energy lobbyist, speaking on the condition of anonymity after taking a job with a public entity, said a one-off program with $25 million in the bank is more politically palatable than something with wider ramifications, like a community energy bill that could shift how electricity is generated and distributed in Pennsylvania.

“It’s a little bit of an easier selling point than saying, ‘Hey let’s create a whole new system of microgrids that the utilities see as an existential threat,’” the former lobbyist said, adding that he thinks supporters would be wise to focus on rising consumer costs. “I think that argument has not been made. And into that vacuum have come the utilities that quietly whispered in the ears of the Pennsylvania Senate to say, ‘Hey, this could hurt us.’”

The recent budget deal did little to boost hopes. Advocates note that a House vote on H.B. 501, the so-called PRESS bill that would elevate renewables in the state’s energy mix, has now been set for Monday, an apparent consolation prize to climate advocates upset about RGGI. But there’s no indication Senate Republican leadership will also bring it up in their chamber.

Similarly, the budget includes language that would clear the way for the state to use $156 million in federal “Solar for All” funding, which would install rooftop solar in low-income areas in Pennsylvania. But the fate of that Biden-era federal appropriation remains tied up in the court system after the Trump administration attempted to cancel it.

Sharon Pillar, executive director of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center, suggests that solar supporters may have better luck focusing not on the legislature but on the state Public Utility Commission, which has the power to draft new rules for utilities. In early November, the advocacy group Vote Solar launched a petition asking the commission to require more transparency on utilities’ solar connection queues and also create “clear, enforceable timelines” for applications.

“If the state can fix those things—if they’re willing to—then we can be moving this forward without a lot of other action,” Pillar said.

In an email, PUC spokesperson Nils Hagen-Frederiksen said the commission has “not been made aware” of any backlogs for small-scale projects like residential rooftop solar, which he said are often given same-day, automatic approval for standard designs. But larger, more complex commercial arrays, he said , take more time to process given cost and safety consideration, along with an application rush ahead of federal incentive sunsets.

“The Commission continues to review interconnection-related issues statewide to ensure that the process remains timely, transparent, and fair for all customers,” Hagen-Frederiksen wrote.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1534871100-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:03:35.579745

I've read that his record-shattering deal had the stockholders up on their feet dancing, chanting his name, and applauding.

To make Musk a trillionaire, over the next decade he must:

Raise Tesla's market cap from $1.5 trillion to at least $8.5 trillion. At the time of writing, Nvidia, with a market cap of $4.8 trillion, is the world's most valuable company.

Generate at least $400 billion in profits (presumably cumulative EBITDA or similar metric) over the target period of ten years.​ To put this into perspective, Tesla's total EBITDA from inception through 2025 is estimated to be just over $85 billion.

Deliver a total of 20 million vehicles, which is more than double what it has historically produced.​

Sell a million ""Optimus"" humanoid robots. To date there are no production Optimus robots, let alone any walking around in the real world.

Roll out at least a million commercially operational self-driving robotaxi units. Today, there are approximately 1,500 driving around Austin and the Bay Area.

Last but not least, Tesla must have 10 million Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscribers. Fully autonomous FSD doesn't exist today. Only 12 percent of the total Tesla fleet has paid for the current FSD (Supervised) offering.

This deal comes after Musk has already been awarded the largest compensation package, $56 billion, in corporate history. Courts have challenged this award, but even if Tesla loses its appeal, Musk will still get tens of billions.

Of course, this is all chump change if Musk succeeds in his new deal's goals. But can he do all this? Let's look at the tape. Tesla's financial performance over the last three years has shown slowing growth, with declining profits and only modest increases in revenue. From 2023 through 2025, the company has faced rising costs, margin pressure, and growing competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

In the United States, Tesla sold approximately 578,644 vehicles in 2024. This helped Musk maintain Tesla's dominance, with nearly 50 percent of the US EV market. However, US sales overall are estimated to have fallen 11 percent year-over-year for 2025. Musk blames, with reason, President Donald Trump for ending EV tax credits and imposing tariffs.​ Looking ahead, Musk said in July: ""We probably could have a few rough quarters.""

The rest of the world is far less rosy for Tesla. In China, Tesla's sales fell 8.4 percent from 2023 to 2024. More recently, in October 2025, Tesla's sales in China dropped to 26,006 vehicles. That's the lowest monthly total in three years. Across the pond, Tesla has fallen like a brick. In Germany, for instance, sales have dropped by more than half year-over-year.

In the EU and UK, European luxury cars, unbound by US tariffs, and Chinese EV manufacturers, such as BYD, which is blocked from the American market, are surpassing Tesla. BYD, in particular, with its cheaper prices, fast charging, and good range, has seen explosive growth.

What this has meant for the bottom line is Tesla's revenue and income have been stagnant to declining. In 2024, the company's annual revenue increased to $97.69 billion, but that's less than 1 percent growth from 2023. Simultaneously, net income declined to $7.15 billion from $14.97 billion.

2025 looks far worse. Tesla saw its revenue for the trailing 12 months down about 1.5 percent year-over-year. Net profits continued to fall, with Q3 2025 reporting a 37 percent drop in profit compared to the previous year, namely $1.37 billion, down from $2.17 billion.

You may have noticed I haven't said a thing about Musk's volatile online personality, his politics, or his constant bouncing from one project to another. That's because, love him or hate him, from a purely business perspective, Tesla is no longer the bright, shining star of electric cars. Under Musk's distracted leadership, Tesla has been in decline.

The hope is that a trillion-dollar carrot will keep Musk's attention focused on Tesla rather than playing with politics or any of his many other companies such as SpaceX, X, or xAI. The only way Musk will get his trillion is if he achieves all his compensation plan's moonshot goals. It's not quite an all-or-nothing contract, but it's not too far from that either.

The cold hard numbers, though, tell me he can't do it. I don't think anyone could.

Tesla's stockholders are delusional. No one is worth a trillion dollars, certainly not someone whose corporate results in the last few years have been mediocre.

AI, cryptocurrency, gold, and Tesla. Way too many of the one percent, and those who desperately want to be in the one percent, think that all they need is to plant some magic crypto beans or follow the right leader, and they'll become high-figure millionaires or billionaires.

Two recently introduced initiatives at Tesla caught my eye in the past week, and got me wondering again. First of all, Tesla has started offering rental cars, which brings all kinds of questions. Secondly, right before launching the rental program, the company started engaging in an interesting new marketing push.

Tesla Rentals? Tax Loophole?

So, the core news on the consumer or public end is that Tesla is now offering the option to rent its cars. In certain locations, you can rent a Tesla from Tesla for $60/day for 3–7 days. And if you decide to buy a Tesla within those 7 days, you can get a credit of up to $250 on the purchase.

Naturally, this is an easy new way for Tesla to market its cars and find more buyers. And maybe that’s all it is. However, it also got me thinking….

As the $7,500 US EV tax credit came to an end, we got news that Ford & GM had found a loophole to push a few more electric cars out the door. They essentially sold a bunch of EVs to themselves, or to dealers, logged the tax credit for themselves, and then those dealers could pass on those savings to customers via leases.

At the time, I wondered if Tesla could find a way to take advantage of that loophole as well. I wrote the following: “Now, what about Tesla? Tesla doesn’t have separate dealers. So, presumably, Tesla couldn’t take advantage of this loophole. There’s no clear network of dealers who are independent partners to the EV company and can engage in a written binding contract with the company. Unless I’m missing something, it seems that Tesla will lose out here and suffer competitively from the loophole, despite initial reporting seeming to indicate that the change/clarification to the terms of the EV tax credit expiration would benefit Tesla and was perhaps made to benefit Tesla.”

Is it possible this rental program was created by selling vehicles to itself and logging the $7,500 tax credit? And now it is renting those cars as a somewhat separate business?

To be honest, I think this is unlikely, since it just seems like Tesla shouldn’t have been able to sell cars to itself, and the rental program is clearly linked to normal marketing efforts, but I have to think in modern America that there’s a 30–40% chance Tesla did find a way to get tax credits by doing this.

That brings me to the second news item.

Tesla Will Come To Your House

Tesla marketing emails used to be almost nonexistent, but they’ve grown and grown and now feel comparable to a local auto dealer’s emails once they get you on their list, but there was one email in particular that caught my attention recently.

The title of the email, send two weeks ago, was “Try Full Self-Driving (Supervised) With a Tesla Ride.” Here was the core text of the email, with emphasis (bolding) added by me:

Experience our latest Full Self-Driving (Supervised) technology on a Tesla Ride.* Run errands, get a ride to work or visit a friend and let your Tesla take the wheel. We’ll come to you and take you where you want to go.

So, Tesla has gotten to the point of driving to your house to give you a test drive.

That sounds nice and exciting from a consumer end. Great! Convenient! But it clearly means we are very far from consumer demand exceeding Tesla’s supply! Not to mention its production capacity, which has been about 30%+ higher than its production and sales for a couple of years.

Frankly, if I was a Tesla shareholder, this would make me very nervous. Tesla seems to be getting desperate. You can argue that the company is just so proud of its tech and its cars that it wants to show people how good they are. But why do they need to leave the Tesla store and come to your house to make that happen? Because not enough customers are coming in the door.

There’s the possibility that Tesla FSD will soon be at a level where you will be allowed to text or do other things while the car drives itself, but in the meantime, it seems like Tesla is struggling to find customers and is in a race against time to crack that magic nut in order to juice sales again. If sales drop enough, of course, Tesla will go from having profitable quarters to having unprofitable quarters.

When it came time for Nathan Shaffer to replace his roof this year, he knew he wanted to keep solar panels like the ones he installed in 2017 on top of his Decatur home.

Hooked on the magic of watching the mini-power plant on his roof charge his electric vehicles, Shaffer this summer priced out what it would cost to upgrade to more efficient, modern panels. As he did, Republicans in Congress made a big change in July to federal solar incentives when they passed President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The sprawling law extended corporate and individual tax cuts and boosted defense spending. But it also took an ax to a host of clean energy incentives, including a 30% federal tax break for residential rooftop solar systems. Instead of starting to phase out at the end of 2032, the tax credit — known as 25D — will now go away Dec. 31.

With $6,000 to $7,000 in potential savings set to vanish next year, Shaffer decided to install new panels before the credits expired.

He is not alone.

Residential solar installers say they’re seeing a crush of customers trying to cash in on savings before time runs out, with some companies hiring and boosting hours for a sprint they expect to last through the final hours of this year.

“The rest of the year is, ‘Who can work Saturdays?’” said Russell Seifert, president and founder of Creative Solar USA, a Georgia-based residential and commercial solar installer.

The surge has been good for business, but rooftop solar’s long-term outlook in Georgia is cloudy.

The cost of labor and materials, like the metal racks solar panels are mounted on, have all gone up thanks to stubborn inflation and Trump’s tariffs, installers say. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency also canceled $7 billion in grants meant to help low-income residents install rooftop solar at no cost, including $156 million for a program in Georgia. Several groups and states have sued to claw back that money.

Still, some like Pearson Kilgore, president of Suncatcher of Atlanta, the oldest solar company in Georgia founded in 1983, believe the industry will manage to adapt.

“I think we might have a couple of bumpy years but in the long run, I think we’ll be OK,” he said.

Riding the ‘solarcoaster’

Rooftop solar companies are no strangers to disruption. In fact, the industry has a name for the changes in policy they’ve long faced: the “solarcoaster.”

Shifting incentives and billing rules from the federal government down to local utilities have at times led solar demand to rise and fall. And though domestic manufacturing is growing, businesses have for years relied heavily on imported panels — whose availability and cost are subject to the whims of the party in power in Washington.

If there’s been one relative constant, it’s been the tax breaks offered by the federal government for residential solar systems.

The first tax credits were created in 1978, when then-President Jimmy Carter was in the White House. Those expired in the mid-1980s, only to be brought back in 2005 under then-President George W. Bush. Their value has gone up and down at times, but the savings have remained in some form since then — until now.

The “one big, beautiful bill” moved the expiration date of the full, 30% tax credit up to Dec. 31, seven years earlier than previously scheduled.

“It’s definitely a new era for the rooftop solar industry, and we’re working hard to help that sector and those businesses transition into the post-25D (tax credit) world,” Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said.

Until then, installers and utilities say they are slammed with customers acting now to realize their solar dreams before the tax savings disappear.

Kilgore from Suncatcher says his office‘s whiteboard for scheduling installations is packed “top to bottom” through the end of the year.

“It’s almost like a jigsaw puzzle, trying to figure out how we can fit everything in,” he said.

Georgia Power, which must tie new solar systems into its electric grid, also said it has seen a near doubling of residential solar interconnection requests since July 4, when the new law was signed. The company says it’s processing applications as “quickly as possible … given the time constraints on the tax credit expiration.”

Guidance from the Internal Revenue Service indicates solar systems must be installed by Dec. 31 to be eligible for the tax savings. At this point, Kilgore and Seifert from Creative Solar USA say they are having to tell some customers they might not be able to get their panels in place before the deadline.

Silver linings?

What will the rooftop solar market look like next year? Most in and around the industry expect there will be a dip in demand.

Gallagher from SEIA said the industry trade group expects residential solar installations in 2030 will be 33% lower than they would have been with the tax credits in place. Seifert said he expects even more of a drop off, more like 60% to 70%.

That type of a slowdown could put some installers out of business, Gallagher said.

Still, those in the industry believe rooftop solar will survive and that there could be silver linings from the phase out.

Depending on the size of the installation, a rooftop solar system can cost $20,000 or more, the type of upfront investment most households can’t make. Without thousands in tax savings available, Gallagher said companies will have to find ways to improve efficiency and lower costs, which could be good for the industry in the long run.

Other inherent benefits of solar aren’t going away.

Solar generates electricity without producing any greenhouse gas emissions. In an era of rising global temperatures, that positive climate impact of appeals to customers like Shaffer.

Paired with an on-site battery storage system, solar can provide households resilience to power outages. And with power bills rising in Georgia and beyond, solar offers customers a way to rein in those costs, Gallagher said.

“Putting solar on the roof is one way to take some meaningful control over that,” Gallagher said.

Instead, the 25-year Oregon Energy Strategy published by the state’s energy department on Wednesday focuses on policy recommendations that will by 2050 increase energy efficiency in buildings and in the industrial and transportation sectors and grow existing clean energy infrastructure. That means the state will rely on more solar, more wind and more alternative energy sources such as thermal and wave energy than fossil fuels.

Nuclear shows up just six times in the 150-page report as something that the state should study for developments and opportunities.

Max Woods, assistant director of nuclear safety and emergency preparedness at the Oregon Department of Energy, said the state is “nuclear curious,” but “taking a more cautious approach that is based on its history and tradition.”

New nuclear plants have been outlawed in Oregon since a voter-approved ballot measure passed in 1980. In 1993, the state’s only nuclear plant closed down. Although the state gets about 3% of its energy annually from a nuclear plant, it’s in Washington and run by the federal Bonneville Power Administration.

“Even if nuclear power were to come to Oregon, it takes a long time to get it through permitting — there’s a lot of security and safety review that has to happen, and for good reason, and they’re (reactors) expensive,” Woods said. “Put those factors together, and that’s a long time to come before any such facility might be built.”

Growing energy demand from data centers in Washington spurred lawmakers there recently to invest $25 million in nuclear energy project development, and Idaho has passed policies meant to clear regulatory hurdles and court private nuclear companies. California lawmakers in 2022 voted to delay closing the state’s only nuclear plant by at least five years while they evaluate potentially reversing course. These decisions are almost entirely being driven by expected demand from data centers in the next few years.

Oregon officials acknowledge in the state’s 25-year plan that the largest driver of energy demand in Oregon in at least the next five years will be from data centers. In future years, they expect electrification in other sectors to meet and eventually outpace demand from data centers. Oregon has among the largest data center markets in the world, which drove electricity consumption in the state up 20% between 2013 and 2023.

“Whether the nuclear power is built in Oregon or not — that’s the question we’re kind of grappling with right now: What the value proposition is for our state,” said Woods. “Our neighbors aren’t really wrestling with that same question.”

But in their 25-year energy planning, state officials found there were faster and more cost-effective ways to meet growing electricity demand than trying to open the state to new nuclear development.

The Oregon Legislature this year considered two proposals that would have opened the door to nuclear development in the state for the first time in decades. One would have allowed voters in Umatilla County to exempt the county from a statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities.

Amazon data centers in eastern Oregon have caused 554% load growth at the Umatilla Electric Cooperative in just the last ten years, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of US Energy Information Administration data.

Another proposal would have directed the state energy department to study what it would take and whether it was worth developing a nuclear sector in Oregon to meet the state’s needs.

Both died in committees before receiving larger votes.

Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT. But in the absence of any federally designated and regulated site where spent nuclear waste can be deposited, industry growth has raised concerns for environmental and public health advocates. Most nuclear facilities store radioactive waste in lined underground storage tanks onsite.

To overrule Oregon’s nuclear ban, voters would have to repeal it or the federal government would need to create a national repository for nuclear waste.

The broader energy plan

Developing the Oregon Energy Strategy took two years, according to a news release from the state energy department. It included modeling scenarios that would prioritize affordability and reliability in the state’s energy sector while meeting demand and energy policy and climate change objectives.

Officials made adjustments to changes in federal policy under President Donald Trump, who has in the first ten months of his second term attempted to claw back billions of congressionally approved federal clean energy investments.

Policy recommendations include imposing new reporting requirements for large electricity users, such as data centers, to understand the role such users play in the state’s greenhouse gas pollution, and whether regulations are needed to bring them in line with state climate policies.

Officials recommend establishing a fund to help provide low- and no-cost loans for clean energy projects to support a transition away from fossil fuels, and to establish a state-sponsored block grant program for tribal clean energy projects. Officials also recommend implementing a road use charge for all light duty passenger vehicles, such as Amazon delivery vans, to fund programs that promote electric vehicle adoption.

The plan calls for funding incentive programs for electric bikes and electric vehicles, as well as Safe Routes to School and Great Streets initiatives that encourage bike transportation over cars. It also recommends major overhauls to transmission regulations, including a state-level commission tasked with speeding up new connections to Oregon’s grid.

Key strategy takeaways are that the most cost effective way to reduce energy demand and costs in Oregon is for lawmakers to continue to prioritize policies that accelerate building and transportation electrification. That includes cash incentives that make it more affordable to replace gas cars, gas buses, gas furnaces and appliances with electric ones, to electrify heating and cooling systems and to weatherize homes and businesses.

Models show if this continues, the state’s overall energy demand in 2050 could be 22% lower than it was in 2024, even if there is more demand for electricity in 2050 than currently exists.

Modeling also revealed that delaying policies that accelerate energy efficiency will lead to higher costs down the line given the volatility of fossil fuels markets and climate change. Officials project that in the next few decades, the costs of climate change — such as billion-dollar wildfires, droughts, floods and other extreme weather — could cost the average Oregonian about $12,000 of annual income.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a06513/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F76%2F22%2F8a9eebee4625b270a2a97954da31%2Fboardman-coal-plant-seen-from-crow-butte-1024x683-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:14.680182

US President Donald Trump has been waging war on electric vehicles all year with some notable success, but his inevitable loss is already in the cards. Exhibit A is the Volkswagen offshoot Scout Motors, which is still on track to launch its first EVs into the US market in 2027.

Since When Does Scout Make EVs?

If the Scout name sounds familiar, that’s not an accident. International Scout was a suite of 20th century, jeep-adjacent off road vehicles manufactured by the US firm International Harvester between 1960 and 1980. IH subsequently sold off its agriculture division and emerged from a soup-to-nuts rebrand in 1986 as the commercial vehicle and engine manufacturer Navistar, later to be absorbed by Volkswagen’s heavy-duty truck subsidiary TRATON Group in 2021.

The chain of transactions provided Volkwagen with the Scout name along with the brand’s jaunty retro profile and its DIY, work-to-play cultural identity, of which Volkswagen took full advantage when it launched Scout Auto in 2022.

“Just as the first Scout vehicles appealed to the bold and pioneering, our growing community is composed of kindred spirits, and today adventure means a lot of things to a lot of people,” Scout proclaims on its website. “Our community is filled with climbers, campers, foragers, and explorers.”

“They’re cooks, builders, athletes, and DIY experts. They’re thrill-seekers, city dwellers, adventure seekers, and modern makers. But the thing they all have in common is their connection to the land around them, their desire to create and support community, and an unyielding will to do the next good thing,” the company emphasizes.

Scout Is Still Determined To Make & Sell EVs In The US

That’s laying it on rather thickly, but this is no time for shilly-shally. The premature death of the federal tax credit on September 30 was expected to send EV sales into a spiral, and it did. However, the recent misfortunes of industry leader Tesla have left a gaping hole in the US market. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk piles one unforced error on top of another, now is the time for competitors like Scout to fill the breach — tax credit or not.

The low hanging fruit is particularly evident in the electric pickup truck area, where Musk’s pet Cybertruck project has gone down in automotive history as an Edsel-worthy flop. That explains why a pickup is one of Scout’s first two offerings, in step with at least three other EV startups: Rivian, the Jeff Bezos-backed automaker Slate Auto, and the kei car stylings of TELO Trucks.

Scout re-affirmed its production timeline yesterday, in a press release announcing the selection of Charlotte, North Carolina, as its new corporate headquarters. The city is within convenient reach of Scout’s forthcoming headquarters, located about an hour south in Blythewood, South Carolina.

“Construction is progressing rapidly at Scout Motors’ Production Center in Blythewood, with initial production targeted to begin in 2027,” Scout noted. “Once it reaches full capacity, the Production Center is expected to create more than 4,000 jobs in South Carolina and attract additional suppliers and economic opportunities to the region.”

Scout also expects to bring more than 1,200 jobs into its new headquarters, indicating it intends to stay for the long haul. “Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably. We’ll build a headquarters that reflects our culture, empowers our teams, and connects us to a region that’s fast becoming a national hub for mobility and manufacturing,” Scout stated, drawing attention to the Southeast’s emerging status as a hotspot for the vehicle electrification movement.

Nevertheless, They Persisted

This all sounds rather over-ambitious in a day and age when the political knives are out for EVs moreso than ever before. That remains to be seen, but Scout is among the zero emission stakeholders to play the long game. In mid-September, just days before the federal tax credit was set to expire, Scout announced that it put up an additional $300 million to build a facility for its suppliers on the site of its new Blythewood factory.

“This initiative, which does not come with any new government incentives, is expected to support approximately 1,000 additional supplier jobs and represents a critical expansion of the company’s existing investment of more than $2 billion in the state,” Scout explained.

The new Supplier Park facility is no small potatoes. It will take up more than 200 acres and host more than 2.3 million square feet of Scout-supporting suppliers in three areas of focus:

• Just in Time (JIT) Facility dedicated to sequencing parts for final vehicle assembly

• Battery Assembly Building designed for high-volume battery assembly

• Accessories Building to support upfitting and installation of vehicle accessories

“The size and scope of the park reflect Scout Motors’ strategy to build a fully integrated, domestic supply chain for its trucks and SUVs,” Scout emphasized.

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

Don’t get too excited just yet. Although Scout’s persona is that of a pure play EV maker with its Terra pickup truck and Traveler SUV, the company is also pitching a Harvester version with a gas-powered range extender, an idea that harkens back to GM’s short-lived Chevy Volt. Word has it that many of the Scout fans pre-ordering vehicles have opted for the range extender option.

Range extender and all, last month Scout received a big thumbs-up from Consumer Reports, partly on account of its refusal to align itself with touch-screen culture promoted by Tesla. “Scout owners will find real buttons and knobs for infotainment and climate control, traditional exterior door handles, and even an optional three-person front bench seat,” wrote the organization’s Senior Autos Reporter, Keith Barry.

“After our experiences futzing around with confusing and unreliable electronic door handles on newer vehicles, we’re especially excited that both the Terra and Traveler feature traditional exterior door handles. What a concept!” Barry added for good measure.

Cutting to the mustard, Barry also took note of the cost of the cars. “As with rival off-roaders, customizability is a key selling point, including off-road accessories such as front and rear skid plates, an off-road winch, auxiliary lighting, and an exterior spare tire carrier on the Traveler,” he wrote. “We expect prices to climb well above $60,000 as buyers add these extras.”

Despite the affordability crisis besetting the nation, $60,000 sounds about right for a versatile EV that can hit the mark for use in work and commercial spaces as well as recreation, complete with bidirectional charging.

Now, Duke and other companies want to build two massive methane gas power plants and a pipeline in Person County to feed them. There’s a mysterious Microsoft project that many assume will be a large data center with its own insatiable energy demands. On top of all of that, Enbridge has proposed and begun construction on a liquefied methane gas storage facility called the Moriah Energy Center.

But many residents are fighting back, strategizing together, speaking out at public meetings and hearings, attending rallies, monitoring construction sites and telling decision-makers that their health and safety cannot be sacrificed.

This mobilization has been inspiring and can inform how residents of other North Carolina counties can take on similar situations. Billions of dollars of pipelines, power plants, compressor stations and other methane gas infrastructure are at various stages of development across our state. We can rise up against this irresponsible surge of new fossil fuels that would increase electric bills while damaging public health and our land, air and water.

The proposed projects include two new gas power plants at Hyco Lake in Person County and the T-15 pipeline to supply them, new gas plants in Catawba and Rowan counties, and the multi-state Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate and Southeast Supply Enhancement Project. These represent billions of dollars worth of unnecessary fossil fuel infrastructure that will lead to increased air pollution, water pollution and carbon and methane emissions, as well a massive potential increase in electric bills for North Carolina residents.

Why all this new fossil fuel infrastructure, even though state law calls for achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and even though studies suggest renewable energy combined with battery storage would be a cheaper and more reliable method to meet increased demands for electricity?

Guaranteed returns on investment

Much of it comes down to the greed of monopoly utilities — which get guaranteed rates of return on these kinds of investments. Duke Energy, the major driver of many of these projects, is guaranteed a 10.1% rate of return on investments like gas power plants. The more it spends, the more the power company earns — and the higher your electric bills go!

In addition, Duke gets to pass along fuel cost increases to its customers — and methane gas is known for its volatile cost swings.

Renewable energy projects don’t cost as much and don’t have the same kind of associated fuel costs (wind and sun power is abundant and free). Plus, Duke gets to be the sole builder and owner of gas plants but has to let other developers build at least 45% of solar infrastructure in the state and buy the electricity from them. This doesn’t return as much cash to shareholders’ pockets.

Duke and other utilities are regulated by state agencies — but they spend a lot of money lobbying state legislators to weaken those regulations. (Yes, your electric bills pay for that, too.)

For instance, the North Carolina General Assembly recently passed Senate Bill 266, the ironically named “Power Bill Reduction Act.” That bill, passed over Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, will:

Eliminate interim carbon emissions reduction targets (Duke was supposed to lower emissions by 70% by 2030)

Allow Duke to ask regulators to let it charge you as a customer for the costs of these massive fossil fuel infrastructure projects before they’re even completed or even if the project never finishes.

Shift more of the burden of paying for fuel to you as a residential customer.

(You can see how your state House members and state senators voted. Even though the bill has passed, you can still contact them to express your disappointment or to thank them for voting in customers’ best interest!)

Data centers drive demand — but projections may be overblown

Of course, utilities don’t say this buildout is about increasing shareholder profits. They say increased power generation is needed for economic growth and to meet the anticipated demand for new data centers. But it’s unlikely that such anticipated demand will ever fully materialize. In fact, one study found that the global semiconductor industry doesn’t have the capacity to make enough chips to supply the number of data centers that utilities around the nation are projecting.

And data center developers are also shopping their potential projects to multiple electric utilities — so the same data center is showing up in the demand forecasts for multiple utilities, even though it would only be built once.

Imagine you’re ordering pizza for a party. You might decide that the best way to get a good deal is to call every pizza place in the county and ask for the price. Adding a hyper-scale data center to the electric grid is more complicated, but essentially, it’s as if the data center developer orders a pizza from every restaurant, even though they will only purchase one pizza. But each restaurant (in this case, the electric utility), still must start making the pizza, to have it ready just in case. In the power sector scenario under the new North Carolina law, regular people (not the utility and not the data center developer) would have to pay for the cost of building unnecessary, polluting infrastructure, even if the data center’s power demand never materializes.

It’s irresponsible and unfair to saddle residential customers with huge electric bill increases to build polluting infrastructure that may never be needed.

As the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy noted in a recent paper, utility customers may end up footing the bill for infrastructure that will end up being used by pipeline companies to export gas to foreign countries, NOT to power the grid. If power companies’ forecasts for the gas they need end up being wildly inflated, utilities can sell excess pipeline capacity to companies that will use it for liquefied natural gas exports — but their customers will still be paying for the projects!

The power companies have nothing to lose, but we do. Everyone who pays a power bill has a stake in this, as does everyone who breathes air and wants a stable climate — methane gas has a devastating climate-altering impact.

There are better ways. Clean, renewable energy and battery storage could meet much, if not all of the actual demand. If utilities still proceed with fossil fuel infrastructure to meet projected data center demand, states could put responsible regulations in place to ensure that the data centers and other high-use industrial customers pay the cost, not residential customers.

Even better, data centers could be required to be powered by renewable energy produced and stored on-site.

We need a fair system with more transparency and less risk — one where regular people do not subsidize shareholder profits and large tech companies through our unaffordable electric bills. We need a system that protects our health and our land, air and water. Currently, North Carolina utility regulators are reviewing Duke’s proposals as part of the state’s Carbon Plan proceedings — decisions that will have a real impact on our bills and our climate.

Municipal utility association VKU also welcomed the industry power price, but criticised that many smaller businesses won’t benefit from it, even though they also compete on international markets.","The German government has called on the EU to allow industrial companies to receive several electricity price subsidies at the same time. Firms should profit from the country’s planned “industry electricity price” and from the existing power price compensation mechanism, which provides relief from emission trading costs, finance minister Lars Klingbeil, a Social Democrat (SPD), said at a press conference. “Both instruments should work in concert, which would be an important signal, for example for the steel industry,” Klingbeil said.

Energy-intensive sectors, such as steel, chemicals and glass, are coming under international competitive pressure due to Germany’s comparatively high electricity prices. A subsidised industrial electricity price is a core element of the government’s strategy to halt industrial decline and boost the country’s weak economic growth.

But implementation has run into delays, as the EU must agree to the scheme under state aid rules. Industry representatives have questioned whether the EU would allow companies to benefit from several power price subsidies at the same time. The EU had already set general conditions for the subsidies, for example limiting it to at most half of a company's annual electricity consumption.

Klingbeil said in parliament it was key that both instruments could apply simultaneously without companies having to choose. “Brussels must not refuse to do this. They must come to terms with industrial policy realities,” reported energy and climate newsletter Tagesspiegel Background

The coalition confirmed its intention to introduce an industry electricity price of five cents per kilowatt-hour for parts of the electricity consumed by energy-intensive companies, which is set to remain in place from 2026 until 2028. Chancellor Friedrich Merz from the conservative CDU said the corresponding talks with the European Commission were nearing conclusion.

Klingbeil said the industry electricity price would cost the state three to five billion euros, to be financed from the country’s Climate and Transformation Fund. In addition, the finance ministry plans to top up next year’s funds for the power price compensation by one billion euros, compared to the original cabinet draft, to allow more companies to benefit.

While energy-intensive companies in the country already enjoy exemptions from certain taxes and levies, the wholesale price of electricity continues to be much higher than before the energy crisis.

Industry association BDI called on the EU to give the German government “sufficient leeway” in setting the industrial electricity price so that it actually reduces costs for as many energy-intensive companies as possible. “At the same time, other companies should also be given access to power price compensation,” the lobby group said. Municipal utility association VKU also welcomed the industry power price, but criticised that many smaller businesses won’t benefit from it, even though they also compete on international markets.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-11-14 12:03:40.578518

Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.

Why flat solar panels are no longer enough

Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.

Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.

NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS

How Janta's solar towers work

Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.

Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.

Stronger, smarter and more efficient

Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.

Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.

A game-changer for energy economics

The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.

That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.

What this means for you

For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.

For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.

Overall U.S. wholesale electricity prices are expected to continue rising next year, the Energy Information Administration said in its latest short-term energy outlook, published Wednesday.

The agency forecast the load-weighted average of the 11 regional wholesale prices it tracks to be $47/MWh in 2025 — 23% higher than the 2024 average — and to reach $51/MWh in 2026, another 8.5% increase.

Driving the rise in wholesale prices next year is primarily a projected 45% increase at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas-North pricing hub. “Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” the EIA said. “But in 2026, the increase in power prices in ERCOT tends to reflect large hourly spikes in the summer months due to high demand combined with relatively low supply in this region.”

Dive Insight:

As prices go up, demand is also rising, EIA said, with much of it concentrated in the West South Central region that includes Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, as a result of “data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities,” it said.

Electricity sales are set to increase across the U.S. by 2.4% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026. But in the West South Central region, sales will grow 4.4% in 2025 and 9.2% in 2026, due in large part to commercial customers.

The increases in Texas and nearby states “contribute 34% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2025 and 66% of the growth in U.S. electricity sales in 2026,” the report said.

Some price increases can be attributed to fuel costs. Natural gas prices are forecast to rise to an average of almost $3.90/MMBtu this winter and an average of $4/MMBtu in 2026, “primarily due to increased liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports amid flat production growth.”

The EIA forecasts U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to increase by 1.8% in 2025, followed by a decrease of 0.7% in 2026.

READ THE FULL USEG RESEARCH REPORT

U.S. Energy (NASDAQ:USEG) continues to achieve major milestones while advancing the full-cycle development of its industrial gas assets across the Kevin Dome structure in Montana.

Upstream Development

During the quarter, two additional industrial gas wells were drilled, bringing the total to three high-deliverability wells in the CO₂ and helium-rich Duperow Formation with each positioned to deliver strong economic returns. The three wells achieved a combined peak rate of 12.2 MMcf/d, with a high-value composition of approximately 0.5% helium and 85% CO₂.

Following testing, flows were restricted to about 8.0 MMcf/d and subsequently shut in to preserve reservoir value until the plant infrastructure is online which sets the stage for an efficient production ramp-up. The company is planning one additional industrial gas well in the Spring of 2026 in the same formation. The company is also advancing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) opportunities using recycled CO₂ on nearby company-owned oil assets in Montana. In addition, the company is conducting helium offtake negotiations with third-party end users to support commercialization.

Infrastructure Development

The design for the initial gas processing facility was finalized, targeting high-purity recovery of helium and recycled CO₂. An 80-acre site in Toole County, MT, was acquired for $240,000 to host the facility.

The infill gathering system (pipelines) design was also completed, with construction planned for early 2026 to directly connect wells to processing and sequestration operations. Permitting, land access, and utility connections are advancing in parallel to enable a timely startup. Initial construction of the plant is expected to begin in the 3rd quarter of 2026. We believe the cost of the plant would be in the $20-$30 million range. Once operational, the facilities are expected to generate diversified cash flow from helium sales, incremental oil through enhanced oil recovery, and carbon management.

Carbon Management Initiatives

The EPA Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) plan was submitted in October 2025, with approval expected by spring or summer 2026. This would make the company eligible for federal carbon credits. A second MRV plan for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations is being prepared, with submission planned for December 2025. The company continues sustained injection of 17.0 MMcf/d across two company-owned wells, equivalent to approximately 240,000 metric tons of CO₂ sequestered annually, while advancing near-term EOR projects utilizing recycled CO₂ on legacy oil assets in Montana. Additionally, a second Class II injection well was approved by Montana regulators in August 2025.

Well Summary

The company has three active industrial gas wells currently with another one planned to be drilled in the spring of 2026. The company also owns two CO2 injection wells.

Industrial Gas

#1) In January 2025, the company acquired 24,000 net acres across the Kevin Dome which included the already drilled Kiefer Farms well targeting the CO2 rich Duperow formation. CO2 wells are drilled at a shallower formation than nitrogen wells at approximately 3,000 feet. This well is expected to become a near-term economic contributor to the industrial gas processing facility that is being developed.

#2) and #3) In July 2025, the company drilled and completed two producing wells in CO2 zones with helium concentrations in the 0.4%-0.5% range. These wells, located within 1-2 miles of the Keifer Farms well (#1 well), together with the Keifer well make three productive wells.

#4) A 4th producing well may be drilled in Spring 2026. This is expected to be located in the same area as wells #1, #2 and #3. This will be an industrial gas well similar to the three active wells described above.

Carbon Sequestration

#1) This was the company’s first well of its industrial gas program and was completed in October 2024. It was drilled to the nitrogen rich Precambrian formation at approximately 5,000 feet and produced helium concentrations of 1.5%. However, the volumetric flow was not sufficient to make this a viable well to develop required helium extraction at the processing plant. This well is being converted to a CO2 injector well has been approved for Class II status. The MRV has been filed on this well with approval expected in the summer of 2026.

#2) In April 2025, the company acquired approximately 2,300 net acres with CO2 rights that are contiguous to its existing positions across Montana’s Kevin Dome structure. This acquisition includes an active Class II injection well to sequester CO2 captured from the company’s industrial gas processing facility (see below for more details).

Potential Opportunities in Gas Liquification Markets

There are only eight helium liquefiers in the U.S. with some being out of commission or not accepting third-party gas. None of these operating plants are currently geographically located to service helium production in the northern U.S. or Canada, so small operators face significant barriers to liquefaction, creating a unique opportunity for the company. USEG is well-positioned to capitalize on the helium liquefaction market, where limited capacity restricts third-party processing and transportation.

Strategically located in Montana, USEG’s operations are ideally suited for a West of the Rockies helium liquefier, enhancing internal economics by producing liquefied helium, which commands a 25-50% premium over gaseous form, and attracting strategic capital by serving West Coast and export markets.

The company sees significant potential to support emerging helium producers in the Rocky Mountain region, many lacking processing infrastructure, by offering third-party tolling services that diversify plant revenues through gaseous helium trucked to the facility, independent of throughput volumes. Acquiring iso-container helium trucks would enable downstream transportation, further expanding access to domestic and international buyers. By targeting smaller, early-stage producers, the company can integrate valuable assets, achieve economies of scale, and leverage untapped industrial gas streams for diversified growth.

3rd Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Results

On November 12, 2025, U.S. Energy reported 3rd quarter 2025 financial and operating results. The year over year revenue comparisons were mostly irrelevant due to the oil & gas divestitures that occurred in 2024. Total oil and gas revenue in the 3rd quarter was approximately $1.74 million, of which $1.59 million was oil and $151,000 was natural gas and liquids.

In the 3rd quarter, lease operating expenses (LOE) were approximately $1.04 million, or $29.36 per Boe, compared to $3.1 million, or $28.95 per Boe, in the prior year period. The reduction in LOE is primarily due to fewer producing wells as a result of recent asset divestitures..

Cash general and administrative expenses in the 3rd quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.5 million compared to $2.0 million in the 3rd quarter of 2024. This primarily reflects lower acquisition related costs.

The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.87 million related to lower oil & gas prices.

The company generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of ($1.2) million in the 3rd quarter of 2025. The reported net loss was ($3.3) million, or ($0.10) per diluted share.

As of 9/30/25, the company had no outstanding debt, cash balances of $1.4 million, and $10.0 million of availability on its bank line of credit. In January 2025, the company raised approximately $10.5 million in net proceeds from an equity offering. In October 2025, the company filed for an equity line of credit for up to $25.0 million in gross proceeds.

Oil & Gas Business

In the 3rd quarter of 2025, the company produced 35,326 BOE, or an average of 384 BOE per day, as compared to 105,699 BOE or an average of 1,149 BOE per day during the prior year period. The decrease in production quantities primarily relates to the divestitures of properties in the Karnes County, East Texas and Mid-con regions which occurred in the second half of 2024 and the natural decline in production in remaining producing assets. During the 3rd quarter of 2025, production was 91% oil and 9% natural gas and liquids.

The company’s proved developed producing oil and gas reserve base as of October 1, 2025 consisted of approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) comprised of approximately 75% oil. The PV-10 value of the company’s reserves was approximately $20.5 million at SEC pricing, with assumed pricing of $67.45/bbl, $3.10/mcf, and $33.01/boe for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids, respectively.

Valuation & Estimates

We maintain our price target of $3.00 per share.

We utilize multiple valuation methodologies to arrive at our target price of $3.00 for USEG stock. These include Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) calculations, peer multiples, price to book value, price to asset value and others.

Our DCF calculation assumes monetization of helium extraction begins in the 4th quarter of 2026. For calendar year 2026, we believe that helium revenues could total approximately $4.0 million, and EBITDA generation would be in the range of $1.0 to $2.0 million. We assume the oil and gas properties produce steady state revenues in the $7.0-$8.0 million range with EBITDA generation of approximately $1.0 million. Under this scenario, our DCF calculation is approximately $3.00 per share. This may prove to be conservative as we utilize a high discount rate of 12.5%. In addition, we do not incorporate any other industrial gas revenues or carbon sequestration related benefits into our model at this time.

He disputed the narrative that renewables can’t sufficiently power data centers, arguing that the grid should be made more flexible to better use what solar and wind can offer.","Weeks after ChatGPT was unleashed on the world in November 2022, sustainability executives at Microsoft Corp. realized they had a big problem.

On the tech giant’s 500-acre campus in Redmond, Washington, teams began holding regular “triage” meetings to confront serious questions posed by the artificial intelligence boom: Where would the company find the gigawatts — just one gigawatt can power nearly 750,000 US homes — needed for data centers? And how could Microsoft possibly secure that extra energy while still making progress toward a long-standing goal of going carbon-negative?

The AI discussions were “interesting and terrifying all at the same time,” said Brian Janous, who served until August 2023 as Microsoft’s vice president of energy. Microsoft and other major tech companies, he said, had to “look at the climate commitments they set and say, ‘Can I still do this?’”

Nearly three years later, Microsoft and rivals including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are still struggling to answer that question. On one hand, they’re trying to obtain every electron possible to power their trillion-dollar bet on AI. On the other, they're trying to stay true to a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 or sooner.

“There’s no question that the current push to develop AI infrastructure is putting a strain on the climate commitments of the big tech companies, all of which were made prior to the advent of AI,” Janous said in an interview. After leaving Microsoft, he co-founded Cloverleaf Infrastructure, which partners with utilities to develop clean-powered sites that supply the largest data-center providers.

US President Donald Trump isn’t making this challenge any easier. Since taking office, he’s slashed federal funding for green initiatives, such as wind and solar, and signaled his support for powering AI with generators that use fossil fuels, including aging coal-fired plants. Wary of irritating their biggest ally in Washington, tech leaders so far have refrained from publicly challenging the president over his campaign against renewables.

For now, the so-called hyperscalers continue to buy clean energy at a record pace, with Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft ranking as the biggest corporate signers of power purchase agreements with renewable suppliers. Together they accounted for 9.6 gigawatts of US clean energy purchases in the first half of 2025, amounting to 40% of the global total, according to the latest BloombergNEF data.

That number falls woefully short of the 362 gigawatts of additional power the industry is projected to need worldwide by 2035 to sustain its growing data center fleet, according to BNEF. With enormous pressure from Wall Street to deliver on AI investments, companies can’t afford to let energy be a limiting factor and are pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy on electricity sources.

AI’s impact is already showing up in sustainability reports. Meta, Google, Amazon and Microsoft disclosed that their carbon emissions went up 64%, 51%, 33% and 23% respectively in their latest climate filings compared to their benchmarks from before ChatGPT’s release. Microsoft explicitly blamed “growth-related factors such as AI and cloud expansion.”

Inside Microsoft, tension between longstanding climate pledges and the insatiable energy needs of AI left the sustainability teams mired in uncertainty, according to two former managers who left the company earlier this year. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the former managers described Microsoft’s climate priorities as constantly shifting in the face of its appetite for electricity.

A key source of strain was over concerns that Microsoft risked a public backlash if it appeared to be abandoning its climate goals in any way, creating a “suffocating level of control” that paralyzed staff, one of the former managers said. Reports were dissected to ensure they adhered to an evolving company line, with individual words in memos and other documents turning into landmines that could “blow up” conversations, the person said.

Adding to the stress, the other former manager said, were industry-wide workforce reductions in 2023 that cut nearly 200,000 jobs, which destabilized climate teams as they worked on one of the toughest problems in tech: how to procure enough energy, sustainably.

In a statement, Microsoft’s chief sustainability officer, Melanie Nakagawa, said the company “remains committed to meeting our climate goals of being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030 while protecting ecosystems. As we learn and adapt, we’re continuing to expand our global clean energy portfolio, building markets by investing in new climate technology solutions, and empowering others with technology to build a more sustainable future.”

Biggest Bottleneck

On a recent podcast, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said the supply of power, rather than the availability of semiconductors, accounted for the biggest bottleneck in data center capacity. By some estimates, the energy needs of existing and planned AI infrastructure in the US can’t be met with current supply.

Dave Stangis, a senior executive at Apollo Global Management who has led the firm’s sustainability strategy for the past four years, said last month that the amount of energy required to power AI data centers is so vast that meeting that need may be more than a lifetime away.

As a result, big tech companies have been buying more nuclear and geothermal energy to satisfy the needs of their expanding AI infrastructure, according to BNEF data. At the same time, haunted by the risk of losing power for even a minute and driven by the desire to win the AI race, some companies are also exploring what’s known as behind-the-meter power, where a generation plant sits in the data center’s backyard.

“They want a new resource, something that’s not already on the grid, that’s not already spoken for,” said Elaine Walsh, who leads the power group for the law firm Baker Botts. She added that “almost all” of the new development work she does is for gas power.

Meta’s Hyperion Project

That’s the strategy Meta is using as it attempts to get its massive data center in Louisiana up and running as quickly as possible.

The project, dubbed Hyperion, is a 4 million-square-foot complex on 2,250 acres in rural Louisiana that’s expected to consume as much as five gigawatts of electricity. This summer, Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted a graphic depicting Hyperion engulfing most of Manhattan — an image that Trump later displayed at a White House Cabinet meeting, saying the facility would cost $50 billion.

To support the Meta site, Entergy Corp. received regulatory approval in August to construct three gas plants capable of producing about 2.3 gigawatts. Last month, in addition to those three plants, the utility applied to tie new natural gas generation to the grid in Louisiana to meet increasing demand from data centers and industrial projects, including from Meta and other hyperscalers.

“From the moment that the Richland Parish data center came onto the picture, we’ve been planning for and executing to secure clean energy to support that site,” Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said in an interview. “What we measure is what is the carbon intensity of the electricity that is serving our data center and then working through the greenhouse gas protocol rules.”

Meta also said in a statement that it plans to add enough clean and renewable energy to match the total electricity use at Richland. To do so, the company said it’s working with Entergy to bring 1.5 gigawatts of renewable energy to the Louisiana grid and that it’s launched other clean and renewable energy projects across the state, including three focused on solar.

Companies like Meta often buy carbon offsets and renewable energy certificates to balance the emissions tied to their operations, but both of those practices have been decried over the years for varying reasons. Offsets can be notoriously difficult to verify, and renewable energy certificates have been assailed for failing to achieve real emissions reduction or drive renewable energy generation.

Meta has maintained that the majority of its renewable energy portfolio actually comes in the form of real, long-term contracts such as power purchase agreements and that “only a small percentage” — less than 5% of its reported renewable energy purchases in 2023, for example — were tied to short-term, unbundled renewable energy certificates.

Nuclear Option

Meta’s use of gas to power its new data center while still purchasing huge amounts of clean energy reflects a balancing act across the industry. Last month, Google announced a first-of-its kind agreement to buy almost all of the electricity from a gas plant in Illinois while supplying the facility with carbon capture and storage equipment.

The technology will capture and store around 90% of the CO2 emissions from the plant, according to a Google release. But some skeptics have cautioned that emissions capture is neither economical nor feasible at scale, and a nationwide carbon storage network would require as many as 96,000 miles of new pipelines, according to Energy Department estimates.

Another option on the table is nuclear energy, which can provide huge amounts of round-the-clock power, free of carbon emissions. Google agreed last month to buy nuclear power from a plant that NextEra Energy Inc. plans to restart in Iowa.

But nuclear power is also expensive, and supply chain issues mean that new nuclear plants will take years to build and bring online. Even though the NextEra generator is already built — and was only shuttered in 2020 — the company won’t start delivering power to Google’s data centers until 2029.

To link data centers to power sources faster, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last month to expedite reviews for grid connections, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. As part of a draft rule Wright sent to the agency, those reviews would shrink to 60 days, a seismic shift for a process that currently can take years.

Under the proposal, data centers could win a speedy review if they include new power plants or agree to curtail usage in response to grid strains during high-demand periods such as heatwaves. However, a data center vying to locate next to an existing power plant would require a study to determine if that generation capacity is needed to maintain grid reliability.

Trump Headwinds

Complicating matters is Trump, who has made the industry’s AI ambitions central to his second-term economic agenda. In September, he welcomed leaders including Nadella and Zuckerberg for a White House dinner where he hailed tech companies’ far-reaching infrastructure spending plans and promised help with permitting for energy projects.

At the same time, Trump has roiled the tech companies’ quest for electricity by attacking green energy with a vengeance and assailing global warming as “the greatest con job ever” during a United Nations speech. The administration has stopped or delayed wind and solar initiatives — some of which were near completion — and declined to send delegates to the COP30 climate conference in Brazil.

One of Trump’s biggest moves against renewables was to use the massive tax bill he signed in July to strip away clean energy incentives created through his predecessor Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Total annual deployment of new solar, wind and energy storage facilities in 2035 will be 21% lower — or 227 gigawatts less — than it would have been without the Trump tax law, according to BNEF forecasts.

Backing out of wind and solar projects as Trump envisions is problematic because doing so would force companies to use other power sources, like natural gas, that are not necessarily cheaper or faster to get into service, said Janous. He disputed the narrative that renewables can’t sufficiently power data centers, arguing that the grid should be made more flexible to better use what solar and wind can offer.

Big tech companies likewise can’t simply discard clean energy commitments that have been a decade in the making for some firms, which have put time and money into reaching them, said BNEF analyst Nayel Brihi.

Reports have surfaced that Ford may end production of its electric F-150 Lightning, the most popular EV pickup truck in the U.S.

The rumors come just two months after Ford announced an upcoming EV platform for new models.

Ford is betting on EVs at a time of slowing demand and the absence of federal tax credit incentives for buyers.

10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company ›

Just two months ago, Ford (NYSE: F) announced a new electric vehicle platform that it will build future EVs on. Ford CEO Jim Farley said that we've all lived through automakers giving EVs too many ""good college tries"" without any success.

Now, just two months later, there are reports that Ford is about to end production of its F-150 Lightning -- the best-selling EV pickup truck in the U.S.

At best, ending production of the electric F-150 is sending mixed signals to buyers and investors. At worst, it's an admission that selling EVs isn't working for Ford. Is Ford already shifting its EV strategy following its doubling down on EVs just two months ago? Not exactly, but it's undoubtedly not instilling confidence that the company can succeed with EVs.

Even the Lightning can't brighten dark times in the EV industry

The F-150 Lightning was intended to be a big win for Ford's EV pursuits, as the company would tap into America's love of pickup trucks and leverage its very successful F-150 brand.

At first, it seemed to work. Interest in the truck was high when it first launched, and the Lightning has become the best-selling EV pickup truck in the U.S. But electric vehicles are costly to develop and produce, and -- just like traditional vehicles -- companies need to sell them in mass volumes for them to be worth making. Instead, Ford sold just 1,500 of its Lightning trucks in October.

One of the most significant problems for Ford's electric truck and the rest of the U.S. EV industry is that federal tax credits -- which were worth up to $7,500 off a new purchase -- disappeared at the end of September. That was several years earlier than originally scheduled, because the Trump administration decided to end their funding early.

Ford lost $1.4 billion from its Model-e electric vehicle segment in the third quarter, on an earnings before interest and taxes basis (EBIT). With EV tax credits entirely gone now, it will be harder than ever for Ford to turn a profit from EV sales.

Ford probably isn't shifting its EV strategy just yet

Ford announced in September that its future electric vehicle model will be built on a new platform, called the Universal EV Platform. Farley said automakers have made too many attempts at EVs that have ended in layoffs and uncertainty. So the goal, as Farley stated, is to create a ""strong, sustainable and profitable business"" for its EVs.

The first model built on the platform is a yet-to-be-named mid-sized pickup truck that is expected to cost approximately $30,000, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2027. It's notable that this price tag is considerably lower than the F-150 Lightning's starting price of around $55,000.

Most importantly, the new platform will enable Ford to implement manufacturing cost efficiencies by reducing parts by 20% compared to a typical vehicle and reducing assembly times by 15%.

With slow F-150 Lightning sales and mounting losses, Ford is likely launching the new platform because its current strategy isn't working. In short, Ford potentially axing the Lightning isn't a strategy shift as much as an admission that trying to sell expensive EV pickup trucks isn't a good strategy for the automaker.

But if the Lightning goes away, it's still not a good sign

Ford has yet to succeed with its EV plans. The company's not alone in this. Some automakers have completely abandoned their previous EV goals and scrapped models. But if the Lightning goes away, it'll mean Ford is essentially starting from scratch with its electric vehicle goals.

What concerns me about Ford's plans is that there appears to be a softening of demand for EVs in America right now. J.D. Power reported that EVs made up just over 5% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in October, down from 8.5% about a year ago.

Ford will invest billions of dollars in its new platform amid slowing demand and the absence of federal EV tax credits. It's also starting from scratch with an unknown platform. All this means that while Ford may be shifting to lower-priced electric vehicles, its EV strategy remains a gamble.

During its Q3 earnings call, CEO Marty Neese confirmed the company “will not pursue” the 3GW facility.

The decision follows earlier uncertainty over whether the project would secure Department of Energy (DOE) funding, after the US government cut 223 clean energy projects totalling $7.5bn across its grant programmes.

Neese, who was appointed CEO in July, explained, “Our analysis shows our existing global manufacturing capacity, with minor adjustments, will meet forecasted volumes.

“This decision underscores our commitment to capital discipline and focus on efficient execution.”

Ballard secured $94m in federal funding for the plant under the Biden Administration in 2024. However, sluggish demand led to Ballard postponing investment in the site, but it was able to “preserve” the grants.

The project had “remained on amber” until October, as the company shifted focus toward cost efficiency and optimisation within its existing footprint under a wider restructuring programme.

That process has seen Ballard cut operating expenses by 36% year-on-year and reduce cash operating costs by 40%.

Financially, the quarter showed the early effects of that restructuring.

During the quarter, the Canadian technology firm saw its revenue rise 120% year-on-year to $32.5m, with the bus and rail sector accounting for 70% of that income. It also recorded a net order intake of $19m.

Speaking to H2 View, Neese confirmed that the strongest near-term traction continues to come from the bus and rail segments in Europe and North America. He said that “hydrogen has a very strong role to play here” during its Q2 results.

Nevertheless, gross margin was only positive due to one-time benefits, while multiple customer orders have been pushed into late 2025 and early 2026, as Ballard seeks more sustainable contract terms.

Neese admitted there is much more to do to “further transform the company” towards cash flow positivity. “We are committed to this overarching goal,” he reiterated.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/shutterstock_2248418429-e1754033387666.jpg",N,,2025-11-14 12:04:55.828724

Past rate hike requests included millions in “wasteful and inefficient spending” such as the cost of private jet travel, Nessel said.

DTE Energy is seeking a $163 million gas rate hike that could raise residential rates by roughly 8% beginning next fall.

The increase would add $6.16 to the average customer’s monthly utility bill, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry told Planet Detroit. The details are outlined in the rate case the company filed Thursday with the Michigan Public Service Commission.

For ratepayers, DTE’s request comes just after a government shutdown that held up federal heating assistance funding for states.

The proposed 7.96% residential rate increase is roughly 3 1/2 times larger than the 2.28% bump approved by the MPSC one year ago as part of DTE’s $113 million 2024 gas rate increase.

Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan advocacy group, said a significant chunk of this funding would go toward increasing DTE’s return on equity from 9.8% to 10.25%, which she said is “essentially, the amount (DTE) can bill ratepayers for shareholder profit.” The MPSC lowered DTE’s return on equity from 9.9% to 9.8% in the last gas rate case.

“There is nothing that has changed since that case to justify going the other direction and massively increasing the shareholder return all the way to 10.25%,” Bandyk said.

Bob Richard, president and chief operating officer of DTE Gas, said in a statement that the request will allow the company to “continue investing in the safety and reliability of our system, while keeping costs low for the customers who depend on us for generations to come.”

Gas rate hike proposal arrives during energy assistance ‘crisis’

An increase in DTE’s gas rates would come as the Trump administration throws the future of federal energy assistance programs into doubt.

The administration eliminated the entire staff for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, in the spring, raising questions about the future of the program that helps over 400,000 Michigan residents pay their energy bills.

“LIHEAP is in a crisis due to staff cuts and proposed budget cuts, and those problems very well may not be resolved a year from now,” said ratepayer advocate Bandyk. “They could even be worse.”

Vulnerable utility customers often have to choose between covering their energy bills or paying for other essentials like medicine, Bandyk said, adding that DTE’s proposed hike could exacerbate the problem. She cited CUB’s October report on energy insecurity in Michigan.

LIHEAP payments to states were blocked during the federal government shutdown.

Michigan’s LIHEAP funding, which supports assistance programs like the State Emergency Relief program, will last until the fourth week of November using funds carried over from the last fiscal year, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told Planet Detroit Thursday.

DTE’s Lowry said the utility advocated for the expansion of the Michigan Energy Assistance Program, or MEAP, which provides utility bill assistance to eligible households through a monthly surcharge on electric bills.

Legislation signed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer increased MEAP’s income eligibility threshold. The surcharge increased to $1.25 this year and can be raised by 25 cents a year until it hits $2.

DTE also offers assistance through the Low-Income Self-Sufficiency Plan, which offers eligible customers shutoff protection, fixed monthly payments, and up to $3,000 in past due balance forgiveness.

When DTE announced its intention to file a gas rate hike request in September, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement she would intervene to protect Michigan ratepayers.

Past rate hike requests included millions in “wasteful and inefficient spending” such as the cost of private jet travel, Nessel said.

DTE did not comment on Nessel’s allegations.

The MPSC has not decided if it will hold a hearing on the rate case, according to MPSC spokesperson Matt Helms. The commission has 10 months to decide on the proposed rate increase.",https://www.bridgedetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DTE-shutterstock-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:02:20.423625

The takeover should finally bring the Ford V-8-powered Griffith, which was unveiled in 2017, to production, and Charge announced it will steer TVR toward electrification in the coming years.

Charge has big plans for TVR; It aims to implement a multi-phase restructuring plan and ultimately create a low-volume automotive group. On paper, the deal makes sense. While TVR isn’t a household name, it’s a respected brand among enthusiasts. It lacks the resources to capitalize on its heritage, however. Charge is relatively unknown, but it’s seemingly better-funded than TVR. The two brands will leverage economies of scale by sharing technical capabilities, facilities, and funding, but they’ll keep their respective identities.

What this means for the future isn’t entirely clear yet. Charge specializes in making electric cars, including a battery-powered, resto-modded first-generation Mustang called ’67, but it’s not going to push TVR into EV territory right away. In a statement, the firm explained that TVR will remain focused on delivering the new Griffith to customers and “continue its legacy of high-performance, internal-combustion sports cars.”

Unveiled in 2017 as a close-to-production prototype, the born-again Griffith (pictured) featured a Ford-sourced 5.0-liter V-8 tuned by Cosworth to about 500 horsepower, a six-speed manual transmission, and rear-wheel drive. Gordon Murray engineered it, and it was initially scheduled to enter production in 2019. The brand missed that deadline for a variety of reasons, including a lack of funding, and the car looked dead until the takeover was announced. There’s no word on whether the Griffith will be updated, or if what we saw in 2017 is what we’ll see when production starts. We asked, and a spokesperson replied that more information about the new coupe will be revealed soon. No timeline has been provided.

Looking ahead, Charge said that TVR will expand into electrified platforms without providing additional details. The move makes sense from a regulatory standpoint: England will ban the sale of new gasoline- and diesel-powered cars in 2030, while hybrids will be allowed to stay on the market until 2035. Beyond that, every car sold new in the United Kingdom will have to be electric, though government officials could make an exemption for low-volume brands, like TVR. If the brand’s going to carry on, it makes sense for the company to play it safe.

TVR previously announced an electric Griffith, but it didn’t release technical information or a launch date. It published a sketch that suggests the EV will look a lot like the V-8-powered model without an exhaust.

Trump, urging the administration to finalize key biofuel policies that strengthen domestic energy production, promote the use of U.S.-grown soybean oil, and ensure that federal programs prioritize American feedstocks over imports.

In the letter, the groups commended the President’s leadership in restoring access to the China market and expanding global export opportunities for U.S. soybeans and soybean meal, while emphasizing that strong domestic market growth is critical. The organizations called on the administration to finalize policies that expand domestic biofuel production, include strong volumes for biomass-based diesel (BBD) in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and limit the generation of RFS credits for foreign feedstocks and biofuels.

The U.S. soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion over the past four years to increase capacity by over 25 percent and today crushes more than half of all soybeans grown by U.S. farmers. To maximize their impact, these investments depend on stable federal policy frameworks that provide certainty for biofuel producers and preserve the economic value of U.S. soybeans here at home.

The organizations also highlighted the importance of the U.S. Department of the Treasury finalizing guidance for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit without delay. Timely and clear implementation is essential to providing market certainty for ongoing biofuel investment and ensuring that the benefits of the 45Z credit flow to fuels produced from North American feedstocks, as directed by Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The skunk cabbage has achieved its goal, as the fly carries its pollen when it departs.","Mimicry is a survival adaptation where one species evolves to resemble another, differing from camouflage which involves blending into the environment.

Some species, such as the skunk cabbage, use rewarding mimicry to deceive others for benefits like pollination.

With Halloween behind us, we take off the costumes and go about the rest of the year as ourselves. For us, it is only a holiday, but for other living things, it’s a way of survival and life.

Mimicry is the ability of one species to resemble another in nature. It is not the same as camouflage, which is focused on blending in with your surroundings.

This adaptation has evolved over millennia for various reasons across many species. There are many different types of mimicry, but some are more common than others in Indiana.

Batesian mimicry is when a harmless animal mimics a dangerous model species. The mimic takes on the same colors and patterns that signify a warning. A good example of this is how hoverflies copy bees and wasps. They are mimicking the black and yellow stripes that scream “I can defend myself."" Hover flies use this to scare species away from them.

Müllerian mimicry is when well-defended species share traits to deter predators. People thought the viceroy butterfly was mimicking the monarch butterfly through Batesian mimicry. But it actually is toxic in a different way than the monarch. This means these two toxic species use the same colors to warn predators: “I will make you sick.”

This type of mimicry is a mutualistic relationship. It helps predators catch on fast to what colors and patterns are dangerous. This allows the model and mimic species to die less often than Batesian mimicry.

Rewarding mimicry is when the mimic tricks another species so the mimic can gain a benefit. Skunk cabbage, while smelling bad to us, smells great to flies. Flies approach the plant, believing it is a prime location for reproduction. Instead, they're greeted with disappointment once they realize the deception. The skunk cabbage has achieved its goal, as the fly carries its pollen when it departs.

This type of mimicry allows the mimic to have better fitness. Fitness is the ability to survive and reproduce in an environment.

Nature doesn’t seek perfection, and mimicry is no exception. Perfect mimicry can be disadvantageous. It would be hard to reproduce if you can't tell the difference between your species and a mimic. This opens the door to a wide range of diversity in the world of mimics. Different mimic species all have different variations from the model they're copying.

There is a lot we need to learn about mimicry. While we know the basics, we are still learning about the complex reasons for mimicry. Interactions between mimics and other species have been revealing more to us every day.

It is important we get outside and observe these species to learn more. Observations rooted in documenting and better understanding mimicry will help us protect them.

Halloween might be one day for us, but dressing up as someone else is a way of life for some species.

The company has three active industrial gas wells currently with another one planned to be drilled in the spring of 2026. The company also owns two CO2 injection wells.

Industrial Gas

#1) In January 2025, the company acquired 24,000 net acres across the Kevin Dome which included the already drilled Kiefer Farms well targeting the CO2 rich Duperow formation. CO2 wells are drilled at a shallower formation than nitrogen wells at approximately 3,000 feet. This well is expected to become a near-term economic contributor to the industrial gas processing facility that is being developed.

#2) and #3) In July 2025, the company drilled and completed two producing wells in CO2 zones with helium concentrations in the 0.4%-0.5% range. These wells, located within 1-2 miles of the Keifer Farms well (#1 well), together with the Keifer well make three productive wells.

#4) A 4th producing well may be drilled in Spring 2026. This is expected to be located in the same area as wells #1, #2 and #3. This will be an industrial gas well similar to the three active wells described above.

Carbon Sequestration

#1) This was the company’s first well of its industrial gas program and was completed in October 2024. It was drilled to the nitrogen rich Precambrian formation at approximately 5,000 feet and produced helium concentrations of 1.5%. However, the volumetric flow was not sufficient to make this a viable well to develop required helium extraction at the processing plant. This well is being converted to a CO2 injector well has been approved for Class II status. The MRV has been filed on this well with approval expected in the summer of 2026.

#2) In April 2025, the company acquired approximately 2,300 net acres with CO2 rights that are contiguous to its existing positions across Montana’s Kevin Dome structure. This acquisition includes an active Class II injection well to sequester CO2 captured from the company’s industrial gas processing facility (see below for more details).

Potential Opportunities in Gas Liquification Markets

There are only eight helium liquefiers in the U.S. with some being out of commission or not accepting third-party gas. None of these operating plants are currently geographically located to service helium production in the northern U.S. or Canada, so small operators face significant barriers to liquefaction, creating a unique opportunity for the company. USEG is well-positioned to capitalize on the helium liquefaction market, where limited capacity restricts third-party processing and transportation.

Strategically located in Montana, USEG’s operations are ideally suited for a West of the Rockies helium liquefier, enhancing internal economics by producing liquefied helium, which commands a 25-50% premium over gaseous form, and attracting strategic capital by serving West Coast and export markets.

The company sees significant potential to support emerging helium producers in the Rocky Mountain region, many lacking processing infrastructure, by offering third-party tolling services that diversify plant revenues through gaseous helium trucked to the facility, independent of throughput volumes. Acquiring iso-container helium trucks would enable downstream transportation, further expanding access to domestic and international buyers. By targeting smaller, early-stage producers, the company can integrate valuable assets, achieve economies of scale, and leverage untapped industrial gas streams for diversified growth.

3rd Quarter 2025 Financial and Operating Results

On November 12, 2025, U.S. Energy reported 3rd quarter 2025 financial and operating results. The year over year revenue comparisons were mostly irrelevant due to the oil & gas divestitures that occurred in 2024. Total oil and gas revenue in the 3rd quarter was approximately $1.74 million, of which $1.59 million was oil and $151,000 was natural gas and liquids.

In the 3rd quarter, lease operating expenses (LOE) were approximately $1.04 million, or $29.36 per Boe, compared to $3.1 million, or $28.95 per Boe, in the prior year period. The reduction in LOE is primarily due to fewer producing wells as a result of recent asset divestitures..

Cash general and administrative expenses in the 3rd quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.5 million compared to $2.0 million in the 3rd quarter of 2024. This primarily reflects lower acquisition related costs.

The company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.87 million related to lower oil & gas prices.

The company generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of ($1.2) million in the 3rd quarter of 2025. The reported net loss was ($3.3) million, or ($0.10) per diluted share.

As of 9/30/25, the company had no outstanding debt, cash balances of $1.4 million, and $10.0 million of availability on its bank line of credit. In January 2025, the company raised approximately $10.5 million in net proceeds from an equity offering. In October 2025, the company filed for an equity line of credit for up to $25.0 million in gross proceeds.

Oil & Gas Business

In the 3rd quarter of 2025, the company produced 35,326 BOE, or an average of 384 BOE per day, as compared to 105,699 BOE or an average of 1,149 BOE per day during the prior year period. The decrease in production quantities primarily relates to the divestitures of properties in the Karnes County, East Texas and Mid-con regions which occurred in the second half of 2024 and the natural decline in production in remaining producing assets. During the 3rd quarter of 2025, production was 91% oil and 9% natural gas and liquids.

The company’s proved developed producing oil and gas reserve base as of October 1, 2025 consisted of approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) comprised of approximately 75% oil. The PV-10 value of the company’s reserves was approximately $20.5 million at SEC pricing, with assumed pricing of $67.45/bbl, $3.10/mcf, and $33.01/boe for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids, respectively.

Valuation & Estimates

We maintain our price target of $3.00 per share.

We utilize multiple valuation methodologies to arrive at our target price of $3.00 for USEG stock. These include Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) calculations, peer multiples, price to book value, price to asset value and others.

Our DCF calculation assumes monetization of helium extraction begins in the 4th quarter of 2026. For calendar year 2026, we believe that helium revenues could total approximately $4.0 million, and EBITDA generation would be in the range of $1.0 to $2.0 million. We assume the oil and gas properties produce steady state revenues in the $7.0-$8.0 million range with EBITDA generation of approximately $1.0 million. Under this scenario, our DCF calculation is approximately $3.00 per share. This may prove to be conservative as we utilize a high discount rate of 12.5%. In addition, we do not incorporate any other industrial gas revenues or carbon sequestration related benefits into our model at this time.

Some would argue this was a flawed premise. The United States has long been an at-best-unreliable presence in global climate negotiations. It is the only country to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, in which 194 other governments pledged to keep global warming to relatively safe levels. The U.S. left the agreement in President Trump’s first term, only to rejoin under President Biden and it is now in the process of withdrawing again.

Regardless, as international negotiators gather in Belém, Brazil, for this year’s U.N. climate talks, known as COP30, there are a few early indicators about who’s stepping up on the global stage and who’s stepping back.

Here’s where things stand.

Next up: China

Cheap green tech exports out of China are starting to substantially change the economic development trajectory of some countries, Somini Sengupta and Brad Plumer report from Belém.

“China has sought to cast itself as a pillar of global stability,” they write, “particularly after the Trump administration said it would withdraw the United States from the annual climate talks.”

The result is that drivers in countries like Vietnam, Nepal and Ethiopia are opting for electric vehicles over combustion engines, and places all over the world have begun installing solar arrays made with Chinese equipment.

(We’ve been reporting all year about China’s clean energy boom, including how it’s leaving the U.S. behind in nuclear development, clean energy patents and building out ultra high-voltage power lines. Read more from our series.)

Yet much of China’s clean tech manufacturing boom has been powered by a parallel expansion in coal, so its emissions have continued to increase.

But the rapid pace of China’s clean energy installations may be flattening that curve: its emissions are projected to rise by just 0.4 percent this year, or even fall slightly, Plumer reports.

The newcomer: Gavin Newsom

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, has seized on the Trump administration’s absence at the conference to show up at U.N. climate talks in person for the first time, pitching himself as a “stable and reliable” partner to the world, Somini Sengupta reports.

“Donald Trump didn’t show up at COP30 but California did,” Newsom said.

The likely 2028 presidential hopeful drew big crowds at COP, where he encouraged climate advocates to reframe climate issues in terms of affordability.

As Sengupta pointed out, though he was a strong critic of the oil and gas industry just a few years ago, Newsom this year made it easier to drill for oil in California, a move he defended as “pragmatic” when pressed about it at COP.

The pragmatist: Brazil

Another government that has tried to balance promises to slash emissions with its sizable fossil fuel revenue is Brazil, the host of this year’s talks.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called for leaders at COP to build a road map to overcome dependence on fossil fuels, building on promises made in previous years. By 2025 global climate diplomacy standards, it is a bold idea, and will undoubtedly face opposition from some countries.

In recent years, Brazil has significantly reduced deforestation, Ana Ionova reported. But just weeks before the summit began, Brazil paved the way to allow oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River.

This decision drew blowback. Dozens of Indigenous protesters burst into the conference venue on Tuesday, demanding preservation of their land and criticizing the oil exploration plan.

Not in the room: U.S. Corporations

It wasn’t so long ago that leaders of America’s biggest companies were proclaiming their commitments to climate issues.

That’s not the case anymore, Ivan Penn and David Gelles report. Whereas past COPs have drawn top executives from Apple, Exxon and Bank of America, this year’s summit has drawn no prominent American leaders.

Some of what’s driving the corporate absence at COP is fear of retribution from the Trump administration, experts told Penn and Gelles.

Under the surface, the picture is a little more complicated. Some companies are proceeding with business as usual, pursuing the same climate commitments as ever minus the flashy marketing push, Harvard researchers Neil Hawkins and Kelly Cooper found in a paper published in June. A smaller number are walking back their sustainability goals.

Still, by now it’s clear that mainstream corporate America is not rushing to position itself as the antidote to U.S. climate retrenchment. As one expert told my colleagues, the risk of drawing the ire of the Trump administration seems to outweigh the benefit of trumpeting climate progress on the global stage.

Who gets to use the Colorado River’s water? It’s complicated.

Years ago, as a young environmental reporter, when I first learned that the Colorado River’s water is divvied up based on a century-old agreement, I was astonished. So much in the American West has changed over that time — the engineering feat of the Hoover Dam, the birth of entire cities and of suburbs, the dawn of air-conditioning.

All of that, plus climate change.

Over the past quarter century, steady downward trends in precipitation and rising temperatures across the Southwest have fueled the longest period of drought the region has experienced since at least the year 800. (That’s not a typo. It’s been that long.)

It is therefore no surprise that renegotiating use of the waterway has proved incredibly difficult. Some 40 million people across seven states and parts of Mexico rely on the river’s water. And there’s been an ongoing battle over water usage between states in the lower river basin — Nevada, Arizona and California — and in the upper river basin — Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.

So no one paying attention was surprised when those states and the federal government missed their latest deadline to agree upon a new, sustainable plan for the coming decades, as I reported Tuesday.

What comes next? The talks have dragged on for years, only now with heightening stakes. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had set a Nov. 11 deadline to give a cushion of time before the water usage rules, which date to 1922 and were last tweaked in 2007, expire at the end of this year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/13/multimedia/13cli-newsletter-COP30-gtqj/13cli-newsletter-COP30-gtqj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:03:44.876455

While clean energy was helping win elections in New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Georgia, Illinois just showed us what’s possible when you elect clean energy leaders and work in coalition to pass bold, people-centered policies.

In a historic, down-to-the-wire victory, Illinois lawmakers passed two pieces of legislation: the Clean and Reliable Grid Act (CRWA) and Northern Illinois Transit Authority Act (NITA)—game-changers for affordability, improving public transit, and lowering energy bills.

These two bills include exciting, creative solutions to challenges being faced by communities across the country:

How do we fund public transportation, as states deal with budget crunches and shortfalls?

How can states stay on track for 100 percent clean energy targets while the Trump administration is greedily propping up coal, fossil fuel CEOs, and tech oligarchs?

What pro-affordability policies can states implement today to help households save money on energy bills, transportation, and housing for years to come?

Our Conversation with Kady and Amy

For answers to these questions and more, we spoke to Kady McFadden, the lead lobbyist and strategist with the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, and Amy Rynell, who co-leads the Clean and Equitable Transportation Campaign. These two advocates were instrumental in the passage of Illinois’ latest policies and expertly break down the bills, why they matter, and what the rest of us can learn from their successes.

Are you a policymaker or advocate? It’s time to take notes, and as Kady aptly advises, “strap in!” You can find the transcript of our conversation below, edited for brevity and clarity.

How Do CRWA and NITA Make Energy and Transportation More Affordable?

Evergreen: A lot of folks are thinking about rising energy costs and affordability right now. Could you share how Illinois' new bills will make a difference for households dealing with these challenges? And before fully diving in, can you give a brief overview of what’s in these bills?

Kady McFadden: Absolutely. We're really excited to have been able to pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act. In developing this legislation with a coalition of climate advocates, but also consumer advocates, ratepayer advocates, environmental justice communities, and faith communities, we were really recognizing the threat of rising utility bills years ago, especially because of high capacity payments.

We need to make sure that we're building enough clean energy because we have a supply and demand problem. We need more supply of clean energy on the grid, and that's the best way to combat these rising energy prices.

Energy policies in the package, first off, include a huge investment in battery storage, which is not something that Illinois had targets around to date. This bill is going to procure three gigawatts of battery storage by 2030. And maybe you and I understand how that is a ratepayer concept and directly gets to the heart of the capacity shortfalls. But it does take some explaining to lawmakers to really understand that! Battery storage is a huge step in making sure rates don't rise any further and in having a cleaner energy grid.

It is a thousand-page bill, so I won't go through everything, I promise, but something we're really excited to shout from the rooftops is the state Integrated Resource Planning Process (IRP), which sounds kind of nerdy but is extremely important.

We're going to be the first deregulated market to have this state IRP process, so that we don't have to wait until people's bills go up to figure out what is the most cost-effective way to bring energy to the state. And we believe that is always going to be clean energy investments. Having this IRP process is going to help us reach our 100 percent clean energy future through regulatory processes.

In general, all of this is going to address a supply and demand problem. We need to build more clean energy. This bill is projected to build at least 17 GW of clean energy, more clean energy on top of our existing clean energy commitments. To bring down costs, that's just what we need. We need to build.

The estimates from the Illinois Power Agency are that in northern Illinois, folks will start saving $2/month on their bills starting in 2030, and in central and southern Illinois, that will be $10/month. That's in 2030, and it goes up from there.

Amy Rynell: If you look at the data in Illinois, in large part because of the progress we've made on clean energy in Illinois, greenhouse gas pollution from transportation is our number one source of pollution. It is the only sector that's getting worse in Illinois. Since COVID, especially, we've seen people relying on vehicular travel a lot more. And that's been hurting our communities in different ways.

When we looked at the climate impacts of transportation and the suite of policy solutions available, a cornerstone of that is public transportation. So we began working with the coalition and many others to look at what's possible. At the same time, our transit system was heading towards a fiscal cliff [a budget shortfall that could have caused service cuts and fare hikes], not unlike that of other urban areas, what they're calling “legacy transit systems.” So, we worked with many different types of stakeholders over the last three years to build a plan of action for transit.

It had a tremendous amount of input and a tremendous amount of good policy thought to it. For our state's well-being and our community's well-being, we need more transportation options that are climate-friendly and robust.

The [$1.5 billion] funding investment addresses the transit fiscal cliff, but it then makes really critical investments in the things we need to be doing to get more riders and to build the system of the future and make it more resilient. From the perspective of riders and especially people who don't drive, who can't afford a car, our youth, our seniors, households with low incomes, people with a disability, this is their transportation mode, and we have just made it exponentially better. And that keeps our city affordable. It is just tremendous what it does to folks’ pocketbooks.

How Did Illinois Pass and Fund These Policies?

Evergreen: These are huge wins, and a lot of other states are in similar situations. For others looking to follow your lead, what went on behind the scenes that you think allowed you to be successful?

Amy Rynell: It was a very robust inside game and outside game. The coalition is really strong. We had to make a lot of hard decisions together in the final days of session. We meet all the time to keep everybody abreast of the moving parts. And as a result, everyone was really bought in. People contributed in ways that I don't even have words for. It was really tremendous.

We met with our legislative champions every week for a couple of years. Because this is complex policy, we needed to be working from the same playbook, understand why decisions were being made, and help them make the case better. That's a lot of meetings and conversations to stay on the same page, moving something so complex.

Maybe the biggest win on the climate side, in addition to being able to grow and improve transit, is the way we're funding it. It’s by taking the sales tax from motor fuel purchases and directing that into transit operations. And that's just a tremendous climate shift. That will have lasting impacts in other ways and begins to recognize the impact of driving in the role that transit plays. So, we're really excited about that move and hope that other states can follow.

Kady McFadden: I think one thing our coalition did that I'm really proud of is we had teams of experts for each of those topics—everything from battery storage policy to property evaluation to siting to integrated resource planning to energy efficiency. Sure, I'm the one interfacing with the legislators in the working group, but depending on the topic, I'm bringing in amazing experts.

It also grew and diversified our movement. It wasn't only me or a couple of us in the negotiations. It was so many of us from the team, and for some of them, this was their first bill, or they were younger and newer to this policy space. It helped us grow the bench in a place that I know we're going to see results for years to come. There was also some unique lawmaker education that needed to happen. These things can be complicated, and so ensuring that we had the ramp to explain how capacity markets work to over 100 legislators is a big task. But you need to understand the basics to understand why we were proposing certain policies.

The final piece I'll say is that organized labor, especially in a blue state like Illinois, on an energy bill, is a really important stakeholder. Sometimes we agree, and sometimes we don't. I think a key piece of making that work and ensuring that we get both parties to be supporters of the bill, so that we can ultimately pass it, is to really deeply understand what their interests are and what they're trying to do.

Sometimes, it's not always what you might guess, but if you can spend enough time establishing relationships and understanding the problems and underlying interests, you can unlock a door and move forward.

It's hard to talk about these achievements without talking about the significance of our governor. Governor J.B. Pritzker, his office, and his staff are pretty directly involved in these negotiations and this policy development. It is really just tremendous to get to work in a state where you know that the governor has your back, is ready to fight for the same policies that you want to see, and is going to be on your side even if there might be more powerful special interests on the other side. Amy and I couldn't do what we do in quite the same way without having that leadership.

What Are Creative Policy Solutions Other States Can Learn From?

Evergreen: Is there a part of these bills that you’re really proud of or stand out to you that folks might not know about, or that you don’t think is getting enough attention?

Amy Rynell: There are a couple of things in there that are really important for getting at the intersection of climate and transportation. And a key piece of that is something called transit-oriented development, or enabling development around transit stations and bus hubs so more affordable housing, walkable businesses, and community amenities can be built.

We've unlocked potential across our state for development around transit that is high value and high return, so we're really excited about that. Included in that—and it’s the wonkiest thing, but it's really, really important—is that we're removing parking minimum mandates around transit stations and routes that have held developers back from being able to develop things because they have to build so much parking. It's really important to make the ripple-effect benefits of transit realized.

The other things we're doing are making our system easier to use, unifying the fares, and using one app. It's a mess. And if you come to Chicago and want to only use transit, and you need to go farther out than the city center, it gets complicated fast. And it shouldn't. So, fixing these problems is something people are really excited about.

Kady McFadden: I have a couple of small things hidden in our thousand-page bill that I'd love to quickly tell you.

Municipal utilities and co-ops have been largely excluded from our energy policy in Illinois, and that is no longer the case. They are also going to have to do their own Integrated Resource Plans that actually model out how they'd hit our clean energy goals—which is just huge. Huge swaths of the state may now be open to clean energy development. We're really excited about that.

We're going to be piloting thermal energy networks in this state, as well as a new geothermal program for homes and businesses. Residential and business geothermal has not been as big a market in Illinois, but now we're going to be prioritizing that, which I think is going to deliver savings across the state.

What Advice Do Amy and Kady Have for Advocates in Other States Eager to Follow Suit?

Evergreen: Lastly, do you have words of advice to fellow climate, clean energy, and transportation advocates to keep them hopeful in their own work?

Amy Rynell: In the words of a famous Chicagoan, an architect named Daniel Burnham, who has an imprint around our city, “Make no little plans.” You have to make a decision to go all in.

We were holding breakfast briefings three years ago, handing out cookies with bus stop signs that said “save transit.” And we ended with buttons for everyone voting yes. I love transit, and that's a three-year journey from saving something to making it great. We used a policy window to do that, but that's a long time to keep a policy window alive.

Kady McFadden: Our fight to pass CRGA was many years long. We wrote it in response to capacity market spikes in one ISO [Independent System Operator] and then ended up passing it in response to capacity market spikes in another three years later.

To my fellow activists, I would say, strap in! Some of these fights take a while, but you're building each year even when it maybe doesn't feel like it. Lawmaker education builds on itself, and then when there's a window to get it done, you can run right through it!

Evergreen: What I'm hearing is circular objects, in particular, make for very good strategy—whether that’s cookies or buttons! Thanks again for your time and insights, and congratulations again on this huge achievement!

The approval comes after a two-year federal review of the Railroad Commission of Texas, the agency regulating oil and gas. The agency needed to prove it could enforce federal rules, a requirement that supporters of the effort said it could do better than the EPA. Critics have said that state regulators have a history of being too lax on the oil and gas industry.

In a statement, the Texas Oil and Gas Association, which represents the industry's political interests, lauded the approval.

""Today's approval is a watershed moment that launches the next chapter of Texas energy leadership,"" said Todd Staples, the association’s president. ""Texas is now poised to lead the world in (carbon capture and sequestration), which means more investment and more jobs for Texans.""

There are more than 60 pending applications for carbon dioxide injection wells before the EPA. The Railroad Commission is expected to review those applications.

Carbon capture and sequestration is the process of trapping carbon dioxide molecules, which contribute most to climate change. Oil companies ordinarily retrofit their field equipment, such as pipes, with technology to prevent gas leaks. The technology has been around for decades.

RELATED: Houston-area middle schoolers to learn about carbon capture through new grassroots initiative

But in recent years, oil companies in Texas began building facilities dedicated solely to absorbing ambient carbon dioxide, known as direct air capture facilities. Inspiring this effort were generous tax credits offered under President Joe Biden, which continue under his successor, President Donald Trump.

Oil companies capturing the gas had nowhere to put it. The permit required to store it underground, known as a Class VI permit, is notoriously hard to obtain, with yearslong review periods. Advocates of the oil and gas industry said the lengthy review kept oil companies from expanding their efforts, which they say are aimed at combating climate change. Some scientists researching carbon capture and sequestration said the Permian Basin, the oil-rich desert in West Texas, has the right geology for permanently injecting carbon.

Industry observers are skeptical. State regulators, eager to take over the permitting process, could rubber-stamp permits much more quickly, said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, an oil and gas watchdog group. Palacios added that the commission has not set a strong example with saltwater disposal wells, built to store industry wastewater underground, some of which have ruptured through abandoned wells, sending torrents of water above ground.

""The Railroad Commission is getting this new authority that is just another form of injection in overpressured formations,"" Palacios said. ""We're looking at an agency that handles bad actor companies with kid gloves.""

In a news release, an agency commissioner said in matters of oil and gas, the state is best positioned to make decisions.

""Obtaining Class VI primacy marks an important step forward for our state's energy sector and our citizens by recognizing the Railroad Commission's unmatched expertise when it comes to matters of energy production, geological knowledge, and safety,"" said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright.

Let me explain.

My home is on a lot that is one-third of an acre. When I bought it, there were 10 or 11 trees in the yard. It now has 25. And I have removed several of them over the years. So, you see, I like trees and have planted a few.

I have a crab apple, several maples, a clump birch, two cherries, multiple redbuds, three dogwoods, a Japanese maple, and, well, you get it.

Some of those trees are tall enough to pose a threat to power lines. And that is where conflict comes in. My neighborhood has experienced frequent power outages prompted by storms that cause tree damage. I have endured an outage caused by trees belonging to my neighbor directly to the north and by trees belonging to my neighbor directly to the south. My trees and I have not been the cause of any outages.

Story Continues Below

However, my fear of joining that club is one reason why I spent $2,000 on a tree service this spring so that three of my tallest trees were trimmed—or, in one case, removed. See, I am the guy who complains about neighbors waiting for the power company to trim trees for them. My dad owned a small power company, and in high school and college, I worked on a tree-trimming crew at times. One day, I witnessed a fellow worker getting shocked when a branch fell on a high voltage line. I get the big picture.

Yet, as fate would have it, several weeks after I paid to have my trees trimmed, I got word that the power company had targeted several of my trees, anyway. Wright Tree Service, a contractor for electric utility AES, sent people to mark some of my trees and let me know that tree trimmers were on

the way.

They gave me a month to object, and I saw on social media that many people in this part of town were complaining both about the idea that their trees were a problem and about the quality of the work being done by the tree trimmers.

I also caught news reports that spelled out how AES blamed tree-trimming costs in part for a rate increase request that would hike the average residential electric bill by $21 a month.

I’m not going to defend that request, but I will say that when the tree trimmers showed up, they did a lot of work. Over the course of two days, they trimmed six of my trees. They took out a lot of lumber and did nothing to alter the shape of the trees. They did a lot more work in the surrounding neighborhood.

If all that means that power outages will be less frequent, I might be willing to pay more for electricity. Twenty-one dollars a month sounds high, especially after a rate increase last year, but I’m going to let the Utility Regulatory Commission figure that out. Still, for the first time in years, I get the feeling that AES is trying.

I want to be able to enjoy the blossoms, the shade and the fall leaves in my backyard. And I want to be able to watch TV when I go inside.

I love trees, and I love electricity.•

(Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today announced that it will establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the Company’s international fleet. The Company expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County.

The South Carolina facility — which will directly support American energy dominance and affordability goals — was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025. The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), reaching 17.7 GW of annual nameplate capacity in 2027.

“South Carolina is proud to be a destination for innovative energy companies that are powering our country with American technology,” said Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina. “First Solar's investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America's energy independence. Their expanded presence in our state will provide even more opportunities for hardworking South Carolinians.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands First Solar’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer. The Gaffney plant will be part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition Sara Aagesen has unveiled a €2 billion aid package aimed at strengthening Spain’s industrial value chain and accelerating the nation’s energy transition.

Primarily funded through the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Facility (RTRF) and partially aligned with the European Clean Industry State Aid Framework (CISAF), the program builds on PERTE ERHA, a state strategic initiative focused on renewable energy, renewable hydrogen, and storage.

The package extends implementation deadlines beyond the previous target of Aug. 31, 2026, with some measures now running to 2028, designed to improve absorption of European funds.

The program targets four strategic areas: industrial value chain development, renewable energy integration, electric mobility, and innovative thermal solutions for industrial and residential applications. According to Aagesen, the program is expected to launch before the end of the year.

In June, the ministry awarded €300 million to support 33 projects across 12 autonomous communities. The new package will add €300 million to €350 million for proposals focused on manufacturing renewable energy equipment, including photovoltaics, wind turbines, electrolyzers, and heat pumps, alongside clean industrial technologies. About €300 million to €450 million of funds will support renewable hydrogen initiatives, covering capital and operational costs, while €200 million is earmarked to modernize port infrastructure for offshore wind development.

Renewable energy integration and storage form a central pillar. The program will provide €300 v to €350 million for wind turbine repowering and hybrid projects with storage, and €100 million for pumped-storage hydroelectric plants. Innovative storage-integrated projects, including agrivoltaics, floating solar, and urban integration, will receive €150-200 million. Implementation deadlines for geothermal, marine, and biogas projects are also being extended, building on €120 million already allocated to geothermal initiatives.

Electric mobility is another priority. Moves Corredores will receive €150 million to €200 million to expand charging points along major road networks, while Moves Flotas will allocate €50 million for electrifying delivery vehicle fleets.

The program emphasizes innovative thermal solutions. Between €40 million and €75 million will support electrification of fossil fuel cogeneration plants, with a similar sum directed to district heating and cooling networks to improve energy efficiency in industrial and residential sectors.

By targeting these four areas, the ministry said it aims to advance Spain’s transition to a resilient, sustainable, and technologically advanced energy landscape, reinforcing the country’s commitment to European energy and industrial objectives.

Under the deal, Rio Tinto will buy 78.5 megawatts (MW) of power from TerraGen’s 238.5 MW Monte Cristo I Windpower project, which began commercial operations this week.

The agreement comes after the Trump administration added copper to the US critical minerals list, and as Washington and Canberra work to stabilize ties following a recent trade deal to deepen cooperation on critical minerals and clean energy supply chains.

Rio Tinto’s Kennecott smelter is one of two copper smelters still operating in the United States, a strategically important asset for domestic supply of copper used in power grids, EVs and renewable infrastructure.

The Anglo-Australian miner has pledged to cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, the company said.

Here is an example installation of ChargePoint chargers “sponsored by GM Energy”, in Winter Park, Florida:","YUM! Brands, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and the new Saucy brand, has selected Optimus Energy Solutions to deploy EV charging infrastructure at Saucy locations.

The two partners plan to install ChargePoint DC fast chargers. According to the press release, the chargers will be compatible with 100% of the EVs on the market today, indicating the availability of both CCS1 and NACS (SAE J3400) charging connectors — most likely through the ChargePoint Omni Port system (also available for older chargers).

Ben Pauluhn, president & founder of Optimus Energy Solutions, said:

“With current fast charging technology, restaurants like those managed by Yum! Brands are perfect to offer EV charging. It takes about 20-30 minutes to charge most electric vehicles with a fast charger, matching the approximate time spent in a Yum! Brand restaurant.”

The first locations are set to arrive at Saucy in Central Florida by the end of 2025. An undisclosed number of chargers will be deployed “nationwide over the coming years”.

100 ChargePoint Chargers

In May 2025, Optimus Energy Solutions announced a partnership with GM Energy and ChargePoint to install roughly 100 DC fast chargers by the end of 2025. At the time, the company broke ground on eight sites in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida with a total of 33 charging stalls.

We assume that Optimus secured a large part of GM-ChargePoint’s program to install up to 500 charging ports.

Its solar manufacturing subsidiary, CSI Solar, shipped 5.1GW of modules in Q3 2025, down notably from 7.9GW in Q2 this year.
The US was the top country for CSI Solar shipments in Q3 2025, followed by China Spain, Pakistan, and South Africa.
It made no mention of these plans in the Q3 results, though the ongoing low margins in the solar manufacturing sector have continued to push a greater focus on energy storage manufacturing.
Yan Zhuang, CSI Solar president, said: “We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market.","The company said the sequential decrease in margin was due to the absence of profit released from the sales-type leasing of a US-based project in Q2, and the YoY increase was down to increased BESS sales, which have had a better margin than solar PV modules.

Simultaneously, earnings per share recorded a loss of US$0.58 per share, equating to a net loss attributable to Canadian Solar of US$26 million. Losses increased slightly from US$23 million (US$0.53 per share) in Q2 2025.

Net income was US$9 million in Q3, and net revenues reached US$1.5 billion, at the high end of the company’s guidance for the period but down both sequentially and YoY. Canadian Solar ended September 2025 with net cash flow of US$112 million, driven by decreases in inventory from the prior quarter. Total debt was US$6.4 billion, an increase from US$6.3 billion in Q2.

Solar sales slump, storage surges

CEO Shawn Qu said: “We are managing the business with discipline, prioritising profitability and investing strategically to ensure the resilience of our operations. I am pleased to share that our residential energy storage business is on track to become profitable in 2025.”

Canadian Solar’s lowered net revenue was due to decreased solar module sales, partially offset by increases in the battery storage sector. Its solar manufacturing subsidiary, CSI Solar, shipped 5.1GW of modules in Q3 2025, down notably from 7.9GW in Q2 this year.

Its e-Storage arm shipped a “record” 2.7GWh of BESS in Q3, above its guidance of 2.1GWh – 2.3GWh.

The US was the top country for CSI Solar shipments in Q3 2025, followed by China Spain, Pakistan, and South Africa. Qu said the firm would “continue to focus on profitable solar markets and to manage volumes in less profitable regions. In contrast, demand for energy storage remains robust, supported by healthy market fundamentals and growing applications.”

US manufacturing plans

By the end of 2026, the company expects to be producing solar cells and lithium batteries in the US. Phase one of its Indiana cell facility is expected to begin production in March 2026, and its Kentucky lithium battery factory is slated to start production in December next year. The company already operates a 5GW module production facility in Mesquite, Texas.

Back in its Q1 2025 results, CSI Solar said it was considering relocating “certain” manufacturing operations as a result of US president Donald Trump’s global tariff regime. It said it might move some operations to “low-tariff regions” in addition to leaning into its US-based manufacturing plans, given the pressure that Trump’s tariffs and other solar import restrictions have put on upstream supply components for US production.

In the company’s earnings call, Qu said Canadian Solar expected to be able to meet the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements for solar shipments to the US, which limit exposure from China-based or Chinese-backed companies.

It made no mention of these plans in the Q3 results, though the ongoing low margins in the solar manufacturing sector have continued to push a greater focus on energy storage manufacturing.

Yan Zhuang, CSI Solar president, said: “We delivered a sequentially higher share of module shipments to the profitable North American market. Our Mesquite factory, which has now successfully ramped up, contributed meaningfully to both shipment volume and profitability.”

He continued: “While our US$3.1 billion utility-scale storage backlog provides line of sight to future growth, we also continue to develop our offerings and capabilities in C&I and residential storage, segments which we expect will contribute more meaningfully to profitability next year. Looking ahead, we expect further profitability improvements, as we begin production of solar cells and lithium battery energy storage products in the US.”

In Q4, the company expects PV module shipments between 4.6GW and 4.8GW, with between 2.1GWh and 2.3GWh of BESS shipments. CSI Solar forecasts 25-30GW of module shipments for all of 2025. Revenues for Q4 are forecast between US£1.3 billion and US$1.5 billion.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Canadian-Solar-inaugurates-5GW-TOPCon-module-assembly-plant-in-Texas.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:59.922613

Barry MacLeod, chief executive of Flotation Energy, said the tax was wiping out 1,000 oil and gas jobs a month – losing many of the workers whose skills were needed for renewable projects like floating wind farms.

Mr MacLeod’s firm is planning to construct two large floating wind farms near Scotland, with the project relying on a steady supply of skilled energy workers.

He called on Ms Reeves to “make a change” to the tax, warning it was also driving away the oil and gas companies who may one day become users of energy generated by offshore floating wind.

“There’s a huge skills capability in offshore energy already here in Scotland,” Mr MacLeod told the Energy Voice trade journal.

“If we’re going to capitalise on that and have the benefits of that, and for the transition to work, you need those jobs and those skills to be here.

“What we’re seeing at the moment is 1,000 job losses every month, so we’ve got a bit of a crisis going on.”

Floating wind farms like the ones planned by Flotation Energy will be reliant on offshore oil and gas companies for skilled workers because of their complex engineering.

The wind farms are designed to operate in water depths over 60 metres – which are too deep for “fixed-bottom” machines – and can be connected to offshore oil and gas platforms.

Mr MacLeod’s warning follows other calls to slash the headline 78pc rate of tax paid by North Sea operators.

Louise Gilmour, the GMB union’s Scotland secretary, has written to Ms Reeves urging her to cut the levy – which was placed on the industry by the last government and extended by Labour – saying that every day an oil and gas worker is out of a job is a “government failure”.

Earlier this month, Offshore Energies UK, the oil and gas trade body, also joined forces with Scottish Renewables, representing the wind industry, to call for the end or reform of the windfall tax.

The tax has already hit Flotation Energy’s planned Green Volt wind farm, which was designed to power the Buzzard offshore platform situated in the North Sea.

Its owners, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, pulled out of the project in August, warning it had been “unable to find an investible solution in the current economic climate” – a reference to the windfall tax.

Flotation Energy is thought to be looking for a new site.

The UK already has two small floating wind farms, one of which is Flotation Energy’s Kincardine site, 10 miles off Aberdeen, which can power up to 55,000 homes.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/71St3r.bbl0avhb_CAB.Nw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/009c09213e68f5a383e6564d95120c07,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:50.783765

David Booth is Driving’s senior writer as well as the producer of Driving.ca’s Driving into the Future panels and Motor Mouth podcasts. Having written about everything from the exact benefits of Diamond Like Coating (DLC) on motorcycle camshafts to why Range Rovers are the best vehicles for those suffering from opioid-induced constipation, Booth leaves no stone unturned in his quest for automotive veritas. Besides his long tenure with Driving, he was the editor in chief of Autovision magazine for 25 years and his stories have been published in motorcycle magazines around the world including the United States, England, Germany and Australia.

Education

Graduating from Queen Elizabeth High School in 1973, Booth moved from his Northern Quebec hometown of Sept-Iles — also home to Montreal Canadiens great, Guy Carbonneau — to Ottawa to study Mechanical Engineering at Carleton University. There, he wrote a thesis on the then-burgeoning technology of anti-lock brakes for motorcycles and spent time researching the also then-burgeoning use of water tunnels for aerodynamic testing.

Experience

After three years writing for Cycle Canada magazine and another three working for the then oldest magazine in Canada, Canadian Automotive Trade, Booth, along with current Driving writer Brian Harper and then Toronto Star contributor Alex Law, created an automotive editorial services group that supplied road tests, news, and service bulletins to what was then called Southam newspapers.

When Southam became Postmedia with its purchase by Conrad Black and the subsequent introduction of the National Post, Booth was asked to start up the then Driver’s Edge section, which became Driving.ca when Postmedia moved into the digital age. In the past 41 years, Booth has tested well over 500 motorcycles, 1,500 passenger cars, and nearly every significant supercar of the last 30 years.

This move comes as part of President Donald Trump's directive to cut the federal budget.

Michael Ottlinger, the union president for the National Treasury Employees representing Cincinnati, expressed concern for the affected workers.

""We have many, many employees in the building right now who have families, and they're worried about how they're going to support those families,"" said Ottlinger.

Between 300 and 600 workers, primarily from the Office of Research and Development, could lose their positions. The EPA plans to relocate these workers to new offices as part of the reorganization. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin addressed the layoffs in a video on the agency's YouTube page.

""With these organizational improvements, we can assure the American people that we are dedicated to EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,"" said Zeldin.

He noted that the agency spent over $63 billion in 2024, significantly exceeding its typical annual budget of $8 to $10 billion. The reorganization plan is expected to save taxpayers $300 million annually.

Ottlinger expressed concerns about the impact on Cincinnati's environmental projects, such as research on water, pollution, and hazardous waste.

""I don't understand how, with all this reorganization and lots of people, research in this agency will be continued,"" said Ottlinger.

In response, Ottlinger is working with employees to determine their next steps.

""The union is doing everything it can to assist employees, to preserve their livelihood, and to protect their rights in the courts because we have several legal challenges to the administration that I think are on very solid ground,"" said Ottlinger.

In addition to the potential job losses in Cincinnati, more than 1,500 positions are at risk nationwide."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.75761-15/496925161_18508310182005866_2136283115625518522_n.jpg?stp=c162.0.486.486a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&efg=eyJlZmdfdGFnIjoiRkVFRC5iZXN0X2ltYWdlX3VybGdlbi5DMyJ9&_nc_ohc=WunKxkfFYakQ7kNvwGVDcId&_nc_oc=AdkhDs6NAQPvcKY3tgxpQuQQqUw0olqRVYrn4gqIbKxhm3yi8DbuYtiNn5uGOfxQTTPoHXUXHJuJRfao176SdMd2&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=puBNP14rQGH23lLn-1YZjA&oh=00_AfiFMPbPoZ-wa3aoDd36dRZ8NvATMbLmJ54Bixo0JggmCQ&oe=691D3D34,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:34.312523

These funds will be allocated to projects that strengthen the industrial value chain and promote the energy transition in general, with support for electric mobility, innovative renewable solutions, repowering, and energy storage, among others. Furthermore, many of the eligible projects can be implemented after August 31, 2026, the deadline for justifying the aid received under the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RTRP).

“With just one month to go before the fourth anniversary of the PERTE ERHA (Strategic Plan for the Renewable Energy of the Habitat), half a million actions of all kinds have been implemented, and now we are continuing this work with this new package of measures aimed at further leveraging decarbonization to boost competitiveness in four key areas: the industrial value chain, the integration of renewable solutions into the economic fabric, a renewed push for electric mobility, and innovative thermal solutions in the industrial and residential sectors. In short, this package will allow us to advance the model that has enabled us to become a benchmark for economic and environmental progress, industrial modernization, and the fight against climate change,” stated Vice President Aagesen during her address, which can be viewed here .

The new package draws on funds from the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Facility (RRF), and some of its most important lines of action fall under the European framework for state aid for clean industry (CISAF), approved last June. CISAF allows aid to be allocated until December 31, 2028—and distributed beyond that date in some cases—thus providing greater security for initiatives related to the industrial value chain.

The Commission has already approved a €700 million aid scheme under the CISAF and it is expected that other PRTR-funded but particularly complex projects, such as geothermal ones, may be implemented after the PRTR deadline of 31 August 2026.

INDUSTRIAL VALUE CHAIN

In June, €300 million was awarded for 33 value chain projects across 12 autonomous communities, focusing on photovoltaics, wind power, heat pumps, electrolyzers, and related components. New calls for proposals are now planned—one is already underway—with funding of €300 to €350 million, which will also cover the manufacture of other equipment covered by the CISAF (Spanish Association of Energy Efficiency and Manufacturing), related to energy efficiency, the electrical grid, and transformative industrial technologies, such as electric arc furnaces.

This same chapter includes a new line of funding aimed at adapting port infrastructure to develop renewable technologies such as offshore wind power, with approximately 200 million euros, the processing of which began last July.

And the promotion of renewable hydrogen will continue, for which more than €3 billion has already been allocated through numerous support programs. The new aid will provide funding for both the initial investment in projects (Capex) and hydrogen production (Opex), with a budget of €300 to €450 million.

INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLES

The first call for proposals for the repowering aid program awarded €186 million in October 2023. Now, in accordance with initiatives such as the future National Roadmap for Boosting Repowering, a second call will be launched, focused on wind power, which will also promote the hybridization of facilities with storage, with a budget of €300 to €350 million.

Likewise, there will be a second call for aid for pumped hydroelectric plants, essential for having more energy storage, with an allocation of 100 million, identical to the first call, decided in July 2024.

There will also be a new call for proposals for innovative renewables with storage, following the allocation of €148.5 million to the first round in July. The positive reception and transformative potential of agrivoltaic, floating photovoltaic, and infrastructure integration projects have led to the allocation of between €150 and €200 million.

On the other hand, a ministerial order is already being processed to allow renewable energy projects financed under the PRTR, but particularly complex ones, such as geothermal –120 million euros were awarded in February 2024–, marine energy or biogas, to extend their execution period until beyond August 2026. The order will be approved after receiving the European Commission’s confirmation that they fit within the new aid scheme established to improve the absorption of EU funds from the Recovery and Resilience Facility.

BOOST TO ELECTRIC MOBILITY

Regarding electric mobility, the package includes two calls for proposals to boost areas that require support, after the various calls for proposals of the Moves programs have had 2.735 billion available in recent years.

The first initiative focuses on installing charging points along major roads, with a new Moves Corridors program, which will receive between €150 and €200 million. The second initiative will address the consolidation of electrified delivery fleets, with a new Moves Fleets program that will receive €50 million.

THERMAL SOLUTIONS

The fourth axis of the Package includes two lines to promote the use of heat and cold, both in the industrial and residential sectors.

Thus, a new call for proposals will be launched to help fossil fuel cogeneration plants transition to electrification. The first call, awarded in December 2023, granted €46 million, and this new call proposes a budget of €40 to €75 million.

This same range of funds is planned for a new line of aid for heating and cooling networks, which received 35 million in the first call, in July 2023.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sara-Aagesen-anuncia-un-paquete-de-impulso-a-la-transicion-energetica-de-unos-2.000-millones.png,N,,2025-11-14 12:03:59.533465

With winter approaching, it’s a good time to check how your home is holding up against the elements.

Protecting your home from cold, heat, water, or wind, can greatly increase comfort while lowering your energy bills and reducing your energy consumption. At Garfield Clean Energy (GCE), we provide home energy assessments and coordinate weatherization services, including discounted programs and rebates for income-qualifying residents.

But if you’re interested in a few quick DIY fixes, here are some tips for staying warm and saving money this winter.

Find where your home is losing energy

You probably already have a sense of where major drafts are coming into your home based on areas that you or your pets avoid as it gets cold. But smaller leaks can add up and really make a difference on moving the needle on your energy bill.

Before beginning your weatherization journey, assess where air leaks are occurring. Inspect exterior corners and locations where the foundation and siding meet. Inside, check for cracks and gaps at electrical outlets and switch plates, door and window frames, baseboards, window-mounted air conditioners, where your dryer vent passes to the wall, and vents. A good test for windows and doors is the daylight test: if you can see sunlight coming through the edges of a door or window, there are leaks that can be addressed.

While checking for drafts, also look at where your heating system is producing heat. Move furniture or window coverings out of the way to improve heat distribution.

Use the time of day to your advantage

Heating your home can make up nearly a third of your energy bill, so we suggest you take advantage of naturally occurring heat when you can get it. The sun at our higher altitude can provide significant warmth, so make sure your window coverings aren’t blocking Mother Nature. One way to save easy money is by thinking through when you need the heat at an optimal temperature. When away at work or sleeping, lower your thermostat. Smart thermostats are an easy way to optimize heating and cooling without having to think about it day-to-day. GCE is offering these for free to income-qualified residents with a home energy assessment as well.

Replace your furnace filter

Perhaps one of the most overlooked quick wins for energy efficiency is your furnace’s filter. Simply put, an old or dirty filter restricts airflow and makes your HVAC system work harder. Servicing them can also improve the air quality in your home. It’s recommended you check the status of your filter once a month. Filters typically range from under $10 to more than $50, depending on quality. And this is one DIY project almost anyone can do: turn off your furnace, take out the old filter, replace it with a new one, and turn the furnace back on.

Give your windows a makeover

Windows account for 20 to 30 percent of heat gain or loss in a home. Unfortunately, windows can cost a small fortune to replace and for renters, the options are limited. Instead, give your windows a fit check with heavier fabric curtains or blinds that can keep you and your family cozy and warm at night. Alternatively, cost-effective window insulation film can preserve the light and view from your windows 24 hours a day.

Block unwanted drafts

The Department of Energy estimates that 20% of airflow into the home comes from openings in windows, doors, and skylights . Addressing these air leaks, could result in energy savings of up to30% each year.

For smaller gaps, you can caulk gaps around windows, baseboards, or corners. If the gaps are large, hire a professional to block drafts with spray foam. Another simple DIY weatherstripping fix is adding a door sweep or draft stoppers. These attach to the bottom of your entry door to prevent drafts from coming through, with the added bonus of blocking noise and unwanted insects.

Safety should always come first when taking on major weatherization projects. The Department of Energy has a handy list of weatherstripping ideas , including the cost and advantages and disadvantages of each. ENERGY STAR also offers a DIY sealing and insulation guide to help ensure improvements are done safely.

It is not only insurance costs that are going up. Climate change is also causing higher food costs, higher construction costs, and more out-of-pocket disaster damage.

We must slow down, stop, and reverse the buildup of climate pollution in the atmosphere.

Instead, Iowa's Republican members of Congress including Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra voted to take away federal incentives for wind and solar in the omnibus budget bill passed earlier this year. President Trump has also canceled clean energy projects, even ones that were already under construction.

That is not only bad for the environment, it is bad for consumers and jobs. Clean renewable energy creates jobs right here in Iowa for manufacturing and installing renewable projects. Consumers save money because renewable energy projects have no fuel costs and lower operational costs.

As the Iowa scientists said about homeowners insurance, individual action only goes so far in reducing costs. We need governmental action to cut climate pollution and reduce the growing costs of climate change.

Despite their name, the elements aren’t actually rare — they’re just typically “finely dispersed,” rarely found concentrated enough to easily extract.
“Indiana does not have traditional sources” of rare earths, Mastalerz said.
Tapping coal “Every point” of mining, processing and using coal presents “special” opportunities to recover rare earths, according to Mastalerz.
However, these materials are “low-grade,” with lower concentrations of rare earths, she repeatedly cautioned.","Indiana leaders gathered Thursday to consider how the state could mine its ample coal waste for the rare earth elements key to modern technology — in a bid to boost domestic production and break China’s dominance.

“I want all these liabilities that we’ve got to turn into resources,” Kit Turpin, director of the state’s Abandoned Mine Land Program, told the Indiana Rare Earth Recovery Council at its first meeting.

Gov. Mike Braun created the group in an April executive order. He directed its 13 members to help develop a coal waste-based rare earths industry.

The 17 metallic elements are critical to defense, health care, power generation, transportation and other industries. They’re also in widely used consumer products, like iPhones and LED lights.

Despite their name, the elements aren’t actually rare — they’re just typically “finely dispersed,” rarely found concentrated enough to easily extract.

Major deposits are found in China — the world’s leading rare earths producer — as well as Brazil, Russia, and elsewhere, said Maria Mastalerz, a research geologist for the Indiana Geological and Water Survey.

Federal estimates place the U.S. at just 1 million metric tons of reserves, compared to global reserves of about 120 million metric tons.

“Indiana does not have traditional sources” of rare earths, Mastalerz said.

But coal and its production byproducts — gob, slurry, spent substrate, acid drainage and sludge, and more — could be “unconventional” sources.

Tapping coal

“Every point” of mining, processing and using coal presents “special” opportunities to recover rare earths, according to Mastalerz.

However, these materials are “low-grade,” with lower concentrations of rare earths, she repeatedly cautioned.

That makes extraction more difficult and expensive.

Mastalerz — who specializes in coal geology, organic petrology and geochemistry — is testing ways to find rare earth “sweet spots” and “optimize” their recovery.

The materials are plentiful, though.

Turpin, whose Department of Natural Resources program rehabilitates abandoned mine lands, said Indiana has more than 1,900 sites. The program has almost $80 million worth of projects in the pipeline, but there’s an estimated $400 million worth of unfunded inventory, he said.

“The economics don’t look good” for rare earths recovery, he said, “but if you already have a problem (in abandoned mine lands) that needs addressed, maybe you can find efficiencies.”

The program tested a gob pile and found dozens of elements, including rare earths and other critical minerals, per Turpin.

“Every cubic yard of coal refuse out there contains about 10 grams of yttrium — what’s in your hand there,” Turpin said, as council members passed around a small case with chunks of lustrous metal.

“The problem with it is … you’re talking about processing a ton of this material for that 10 grams,” he told them.

The gob pile has an estimated $10 billion worth of rubidium in it, he added, but it’s stuck in 2 million yards of material.

The program must use its largely federal funding on mine land reclamation, however. Rare earths recovery has to be “incidental” — another challenge.

‘Your test state’

Federal officials called in from Washington, D.C., to praise Indiana.

“The things that you’re doing are the same things that we would like to do,” said Lanny Erdos, director of the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.

“We really are with you in your efforts here,” said Ned Mamula, director of the U.S. Geological Survey. “… We want to change our thinking about this. Pile of waste? No. … There’s products in there. We’ve got to find a way to get them out.”

Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski thanked the pair, telling them, “Keep in mind, we’d like to be your test state — a beta — and definitely your partner here. So we’ll keep you updated on our activities.”

Braun’s order includes several directives for the council: advance a coal site cleanup program, collaborate with industry on extraction and processing technology, establish Indiana-based supply and refinery operations, and work with educational institutions to create an extraction and processing workforce program.

The group has to provide annual updates to the governor, and a final report is due before the end of 2026.

The next meeting date hasn’t yet been set. Council members suggested bringing in industry representatives, like those interested in processing rare earths out of coal waste or those who’d use the elements in their products.

Others recommended calling on more academics, since the technology might not be advanced enough for industry, and to consider recovering the elements from recycled technology.

Indiana has an estimated 57 billion tons of unmined coal but only 17 billion tons are recoverable using current technology, said Tommy Sutton, vice president of surface operations at Hallador Energy’s Sunrise Coal.

Of that recoverable amount, 88% would require underground mining and just 12% could be extracted via surface mining.

“I think we’ve got several years,” Sutton said of the industry, but companies are “competing for the same coal reserves.” He said coal companies are turning to byproducts like methane, sulphur and possibly rare earths.

“What was refuse at one point is now something you can actually use,” he told the council.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6704-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 08:59:19.270972

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.
Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality.
Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.
Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues.","Like many communities along the East Coast, the town of Crisfield, Maryland, has a flooding problem. As the climate changes, storms are growing more intense, and rising ocean waters are increasingly pushing into low-lying areas, causing chronic flooding.

Residents have been working on plans to address the problem, and starting in 2022, they received a boost from researchers at the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, E&E News reported.

“EPA’s research project in Crisfield identified marshes and other natural buffers that would help reduce storm surge and flood damages,” the outlet reported. “The work was critical, city officials said, as the city government has no engineer on staff and a limited budget.”

But the Trump administration halted EPA support for Crisfield and many other communities when it began eliminating the Office of Research and Development, or ORD, this summer, and launching a new environmental research arm in the Office of the Administrator. The reorganization was completed last month, an EPA spokeswoman told E&E News.

In its previous form, ORD employed more than 1,000 people and ran 10 national laboratories across the country that researched air pollution and other environmental threats. During the reorganization, many ORD scientists accepted early retirement, while others were reassigned to positions elsewhere across the agency.

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.

However, these short-term savings come at far greater long-term costs, both financially and in terms of human health, infrastructure, and national security. Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality. With fewer researchers, it becomes harder to justify or enforce regulations on major polluters. And without a robust scientific workforce, the U.S. will struggle to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies like wildfires, chemical spills, or extreme weather, putting more lives at risk.

“This is total victory for the polluters right now,” Thomas Burke, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University and former EPA science adviser, told ScienceInsider.

Solution: Establish an independent environmental science institute

One solution would be for a coalition of states, universities, and philanthropies to establish a nonpartisan scientific institution. Such a body could conduct independent climate and environmental research better insulated from political swings, and ensure that critical data and analysis remain available to protect public health and the environment.

This model is not unique. Canada’s experience shows how regional governments and independent institutions can step up when federal leadership falters. In 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper cut funding for the Experimental Lakes Area, a globally recognized freshwater research site. Rather than let the facility close, the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba partnered with the International Institute for Sustainable Development to take over funding and operations, keeping vital research on water pollution, climate change, and ecosystem health alive.

We may also take inspiration from an organization that was formed in response to an immunization crisis. When they realized that nearly 30 million children lacked proper vaccination in developing countries, a group of people (among them Bill Gates) decided to found the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an internationally funded organization that researches vaccines and improves access to immunization around the world. In the past 25 years, they have helped vaccinate 1.1 billion children. Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.

Without the EPA’s research arm, we will be flying blind as we face threats from toxic hazards to rising seas. Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues. In an era of proliferating climate threats, we have a moral obligation to preserve this scientific capacity.

State legislators can act now to align utility profit motives with performance, or at least efficient investment, and lower electricity bills in the process.","Electricity is getting more expensive — and Americans are getting worried.

Just look at last week’s election, when Democratic candidates who put a spotlight on energy affordability won key races in Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia.

Fortunately, state and local lawmakers, including those just elected, have the authority to do something about this increasingly urgent problem. Here are three immediate steps they can take to save consumers money on their power bills.

Cut runaway utility profit rates

State regulators can lower skyrocketing electric bills practically overnight by reducing utility profit rates. Investor-owned utilities earn a guaranteed profit on every dollar they spend. State public utilities commissions set these profit rates, and right now they’re way higher than they used to be.

Former utility executive Mark Ellis estimates the average American household overpays utilities by $300 per year, because the companies extract 3 to 7 cents more on every dollar of investment than they ought to.

Utilities consistently try to scare regulators off from lowering their excessive profits, claiming service quality will decrease or costs will actually rise — but there’s little evidence that doing so will negatively impact consumers.

We know that utilities can maintain high-quality service with lower profit rates because they’ve done it before. Recent research by RMI shows that utilities still received enough capital to build new infrastructure when profits were more reasonable in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Returning profit rates to those lower levels can also more than offset any increases in borrowing costs that might result from impacts to credit ratings.

Pay utilities for performance

Lawmakers can save consumers billions by adjusting incentives to pay utilities for performance rather than construction.

Under current rules, utilities profit significantly more from building new infrastructure than from investing in energy efficiency or cheaper upgrades to existing poles and wires. Most analyses of high electricity prices find that utility spending on transmission and distribution infrastructure is a main or major culprit.

The more utilities build, the more they profit, so they build a lot. Every grid problem looks like a nail to a utility that can use a gold-plated hammer to ​“solve” it — and consumers get bent out of shape as a result.

Customers in New York saved big when, in 2013, the state directed utility Con Edison to prioritize reducing energy demand via efficiency initiatives and solar panel installations. The investment successfully put off a $1 billion substation upgrade, saving New Yorkers $500 million in profits not paid to utility shareholders on top of $800 million in avoided hardware upgrades.

We could significantly reduce electricity use with energy-efficiency investments that routinely cost less than the fossil-fuel power generation favored by most utilities.

Instead, utility grid spending has exploded in recent years, outpacing inflation and electricity sales combined, according to the Energy Information Administration. And for each dollar of capital utilities invest in infrastructure, they’ll extract as much as 50 cents back in profits from customers over the life of the pole, transformer, or equipment.

A few states have comprehensive programs requiring utilities to prioritize cost-effectiveness rather than construction, but only Hawaii has discarded the conventional wisdom connecting utility profits to spending. State legislators can act now to align utility profit motives with performance, or at least efficient investment, and lower electricity bills in the process.

Unblock local power and storage

Local solar and batteries make electricity right where people use it, and more of each saves everyone money. Models suggest that dramatically scaling up energy resources like rooftop solar and batteries, and coordinating them with tools like smart thermostats, could cut future grid costs by half a trillion dollars.

But state and local laws, and utilities’ own policies around crucial processes like connecting to the grid, are mostly written to block and slow down small-scale clean energy.

It’s up to lawmakers to enact policies that remove those barriers by, for example, simplifying and automating permitting and zoning requirements, allowing non-utility ownership of solar projects, and fairly compensating solar owners through net metering. They’ll have to overcome vehement opposition from utilities, which see these kinds of policies as endangering their profits and allocate their lobbying dollars accordingly.

Addressing affordability

Electricity prices are rising at more than twice the rate of inflation. The Trump administration’s obstruction of clean energy and commitment to fossil fuels, particularly coal, are expected to make bills climb even further. Data-center development won’t help either. Most Americans feel this trend happening, and they are concerned.

We’re all tired of paying more for electricity. We can pay less if state legislators and utility regulators seize the moment and act in the interest of consumers — rather than the shareholders of utility companies.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2213793348.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=8f3d37b267c246f05de3d80957c31199,N,,2025-11-14 12:04:21.798025

Meaningful ramp in G1_Dallas production, sales, and EBITDA expected in Q4 2025. T1 expects that module sales in the fourth quarter will exceed the total sales during the first three quarters of 2025. In Q4 2025, G1_Dallas production is expected to achieve a 4.5 GW annualized run rate, more than twice the rate averaged in the first three quarters of 2025. This increased activity underpins unchanged 2025 EBITDA guidance of $25 - $50 million.

T1 received $50 million from Encompass Capital Advisors LLC (“Encompass”). The Company entered into an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement with Encompass, and in partial consideration for the cancellation of all the outstanding shares of the Series A preferred stock, which were previously issued for $50 million, Encompass purchased (i) 21.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) 1.6 million shares of the Company’s Series B preferred stock through a registered direct offering. Additionally, as part of this offering, T1 received $50 million from Encompass in exchange for the issuance of the Company’s Series B-1 preferred stock. This agreement amended and restated the previous Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Encompass.

G2_Austin progressing towards expected start of construction in Q4 2025. T1’s development team and contractors have been advancing detailed design and engineering of its planned state-of-the-art U.S. solar cell fab in Rockdale, Texas. An extended 30% design package was completed in September which encompasses early procurement packages for long lead time equipment and materials, early construction packages for mobilization, civil works, and structural steel as well as design specifications for major scope areas including the cleanroom, electrical and mechanical equipment, and process equipment for utility distribution. T1 expects to achieve the 60% engineering completion milestone for the two-phase development plan in November ahead of the expected start of construction in Q4 2025. This timeline is driven by customer demand for domestic cells in order to maximize PTC realizations.

“The T1 team continued to advance our mission to build an integrated U.S. polysilicon solar supply chain in the third quarter,” commented Dan Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “With the expected start of construction at G2_Austin and our continued progress on commercial discussions, capital formation, and policy compliance initiatives, we are positioning T1 as a domestic content leader with an expanding network of U.S. partners committed to powering America.”

Highlights of Third Quarter 2025 and Subsequent Events

Nextpower and T1 sign multi-year U.S. frame supply agreement. In October, Nextpower (NASDAQ: NXT) and T1 announced a strategic framework agreement to use Nextpower’s patented steel module frame technology for G1_Dallas modules. The agreement advances T1’s mission to establish an integrated U.S. solar supply chain and is expected to accelerate the industry’s transition away from imported aluminum frames towards made-in-the-USA frames using locally manufactured specialty steel.

T1 makes strategic investment in Talon. In October, T1 announced that the Company had entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire a minority equity stake in Talon PV LLC, which is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell fab in Baytown, Texas. Independent of the Talon investment, T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available TOPCon solar cells in the U.S.

T1 advances G2_Austin development with capital formation progress. Proceeds from T1’s $72 million registered direct equity offering coupled with a $50 million registered direct convertible preferred offering have positioned T1 to move forward with plans to start construction of its G2_Austin U.S. solar cell fab in Q4 2025. The offerings closed in October, providing T1 with a meaningful portion of the capital required to finance the first 2.1 GW phase of G2_Austin, with the remainder expected to be comprised of debt and anticipated customer offtake deposits.

Business Update and Guidance

Commercial discussions for G2_Austin offtake contracts progressing. T1 is in advanced negotiations with multiple potential offtake customers for G1_Dallas modules made with G2_Austin cells for deliveries starting in 2027. The Company expects to sign at least one contract before year-end 2025, which is consistent with timelines of T1’s ongoing G2_Austin capital formation initiatives.

Maintaining 2025 EBITDA guidance range of $25 - $50 million. In Q4 2025, T1 expects a significant increase in sales related to the highest expected production year-to-date at G1_Dallas, as well as sales of module inventory to retain Section 45X credits prior to year-end policy changes. T1 expects to finish 2025 with limited finished goods inventory in advance of new supply chain regulations.

Summary of G2_Austin phased development plan and G2 Phase 1 EBITDA guidance. As mentioned in T1’s Q3 2025 preliminary earnings release on October 22nd, the company has decided to develop its planned G2_Austin U.S. PV solar cell manufacturing facility in two phases. Each phase is a standalone development with limited shared infrastructure; T1 is positioned to flex capacity to develop up to three phases potentially totaling as many as 8 GW on T1’s existing leasehold. The rationale behind the phased development approach is to match planned capacity with long-term offtake contracts, advance capital formation initiatives, and start production in Q4 2026 to address robust customer demand. Following the initial completion of detailed project engineering, the first phase of G2_Austin is expected to total 2.1 GW of annual production capacity with an estimated capital expenditure of $400 - $425 million. The estimated annual run-rate EBITDA with G1_Dallas operating at 5 GW capacity and the first 2.1 GW phase of G2_Austin fully online is $375 - $450 million. T1 expects to start G2 Phase 1 construction in Q4 2025 with planned start of production in Q4 2026.

Section 232 and U.S. policy summary. T1 supports the U.S. Commerce Department investigation under Section 232 into the use of foreign-sourced polysilicon and polysilicon derivatives. T1 Energy’s contract to purchase hyper-pure, U.S.-origin polysilicon would likely be advantaged by any potential tariffs or import restrictions that result from this case. In addition, T1 continues to advance its near-term priority of ensuring eligibility for section 45X tax credits in 2026 and beyond. The Company continues to make progress and expects to be compliant by year-end.

Offtake contract negotiation. T1 is involved in a potential dispute with one of its long-term supply offtake customers that reduced expected sales volumes in Q3 2025. The Company expects that the deferred third quarter sales volumes under this contract will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2025. While T1 continues to negotiate with the counterparty to achieve a resolution, the Company believes it has a strong position under the contract and will evaluate all options. As a result of the potential dispute, T1 is recording a non-cash impairment to intangible assets of $53.2 million.

T1 is advancing European portfolio optimization initiatives. The Company continues to execute workstreams and discussions to generate value for shareholders from assets in the Company’s discontinued operations and will provide updates in accordance with progress.

Q3 2025 Results Overview

T1 Energy reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2025 of $140.8 million, or $0.87 per share compared to a net loss of $27.5 million, or $0.20 per share for the third quarter of 2024. Net loss from continuing operations was $127.6 million, or $0.85 per share for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $14.2 million, or $0.10 per share for the third quarter of 2024. Net loss from discontinued operations was $3.0 million, or $0.02 per share for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $13.4 million, or $0.10 per share for the third quarter of 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, T1 had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $86.7 million, of which $34.1 million was unrestricted cash. In addition, T1 has accrued $93.1 million of Section 45X credits as of September 30, 2025, that the Company expects to monetize.

Batteries from the plant are set to power hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4 and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row battery electric vehicle. The plant is producing hybrid batteries for factories in Kentucky and a Mazda Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,” said Toyota Motor North America president Ted Ogawa.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, US President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

“We know there is no single path to progress,” Ogawa said on Wednesday. “That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other automakers like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

What's changed in the bloc's emissions targets?
The hard-fought compromise is still more ambitious than the stated targets of other major economic powers like China or the US.

While the votes passed with comfortable majorities, one was contentious as it involved the center-right EPP bloc in parliament allying with populist right-wing factions to push the changes through.

What's changed in the bloc's emissions targets?

The plan to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels by 2040 now allows EU member states to outsource 5% of that target to countries outside the bloc via so-called carbon credits. These involve paying third parties for their reduction of harmful emissions rather than reducing them in-house.

Scientific advisers to the EU had said reductions of 90% without offsets were necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to nominal pre-industrial levels, the non-binding global goal voiced in the Paris Agreement of 2015 that various reports now warn will soon be exceeded.

The hard-fought compromise is still more ambitious than the stated targets of other major economic powers like China or the US.

The adjusted target passed with a majority of 379 in favor, 248 against and 10 abstentions. Lawmakers also rejected a proposal from the far-right bloc Patriots for Europe calling for the goal to be scrapped entirely.

The parliament supported delaying the inclusion of fuels like natural gas and petroleum in the EU's trading system by one year until 2028, in an effort to limit increases in heating and fuel prices.

The environment ministers of the 27 member states already backed the tweaked targets last week, narrowly avoiding heading to the global COP30 climate summit currently taking place in Brazil empty handed.

What's changed in the corporate sustainability plans for big business?

Thursday's more contentious vote was on softening the provisions of the EU's environmental and human rights rules for big business.

Known as the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and hailed as groundbreaking when first agreed, it calls on large companies to address the ""adverse human rights and environmental impacts"" of their supply chains worldwide.

Perhaps the biggest change was on the qualifying criteria. Companies will now need at least 5,000 employees, rather than 1,000, and an annual turnover of at least €1.5 billion (roughly $1.7 billion) to be subject to the directive.

The proposal also moves to do away with harmonized European penalties for those in breach, instead referring to national legislation.

Far-right backing needed for CSDDD changes

The CSDDD changes passed with a comfortable majority, 382 for and 248 against, but, contentiously, they required the support of the right-wing populist bloc known as Patriots for Europe (PfE).

This followed an impasse between more centrist and center-right groups in parliament, seeking to dilute the plans in a bid to help European industry amid pressure from US sanctions and other factors, and more center-left and environmentalist groups that wanted to retain the plans as they were.

Rene Repasi, a German MEP from the center-left Socialist & Democrats (S&D) bloc accused the center-right European People's Party, the largest bloc in parliament, of having ""torpedoed any middle-ground compromise.""

""The conservatives marched ahead with a red pen — striking away the firewall and redrawing their self-made majority together with the anti-democratic forces on the fringes,"" Repasi said after the vote.

Jorgen Warborn, an EPP lawmaker who sponsored the revisions, said the changes would bring greater ""predictability"" and boost competitiveness for companies while still keeping ""Europe's green transition on track.""

Patriots for Europe, meanwhile, celebrated their rare involvement in proposed legislation that actually cleared the European Parliament.

""A major victory for workers, farmers and industry,"" the group wrote online. ""Today, Patriots for Europe broke the old coalition's deadlock and opened the path to replace the Green Deal straitjacket with a competitiveness-driven agenda. We proved that another majority — and another policy for Europe — is possible. This is only the beginning.""

Thursday's changes still represented tougher standards than many major players had advocated. Both German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron had floated the idea of scrapping the plans altogether. Gas importers to Europe like the US and Qatar had warned that the legislation could threaten future energy imports.

The new system significantly improves the hospital’s ability to deliver uninterrupted care during hurricanes, grid disruptions and other outage emergencies.

With the addition of the Power Through service, BRG can now maintain all operations on both campuses, including emergency rooms, intensive care units, surgical suites and inpatient services, during long outages or major storms. Enchanted Rock’s natural gas-powered generators are far more dependable in emergencies than diesel systems, which are susceptible to fuel constraints when supply chains are disrupted.

Unlike traditional generators that only support limited operations in a healthcare facility, BRG’s microgrid system delivers power to the entire campus. The full-facility power provided by the system includes lifesaving equipment, HVAC systems, lighting, and chilled water plants that support essential care, allowing patients to remain comfortably in their rooms and departments fully operational during an outage. The microgrid can also provide power to the grid when needed, supporting surrounding areas and further strengthening community readiness.

Severe weather often increases demand for medical services, and the need for resilient power at hospitals is well documented. During Hurricane Ida, BRG cared for ICU patients evacuated from Port Fourchon and provided emergency care to displaced residents from across the region.

The project, which was supported by State Capital Outlay funding, was completed in partnership with Entergy Louisiana’s Power Through program and utility-grade microgrid provider Enchanted Rock.

BRG President and CEO Edgardo Tenreiro said the moment has been decades in the making.

“For more than two decades, whole-facility generators have been our goal, and for a couple of years now Baton Rouge General, the State of Louisiana and Entergy have worked together to make this a reality,” Tenreiro said. “Bringing these generators online is not just an investment in infrastructure but in peace of mind, ensuring that our team can continue delivering safe, uninterrupted care to our patients no matter the circumstances.”

Entergy Louisiana leadership said the BRG project reflects the purpose of the Power Through program.

“This project showcases the best of what we aim to do at Entergy: provide solutions that strengthen critical infrastructure and support the well-being of our communities,” said Jody Montelaro, vice president of public affairs at Entergy Louisiana.

Louisiana leaders praised the collaboration behind BRG’s new backup power system, highlighting the project as an example of innovation, reliability and resilience in action.

“This project is a great example of what can happen when public funding and private innovation work together,” said Sen. Franklin Foil of Louisiana’s 16th District. “These new generators help ensure Baton Rouge General can provide continuous care for our community no matter what storms come our way. Reliable backup power at our hospitals means safety and peace of mind for families across Baton Rouge and the region.”

Louisiana public service commissioners also applauded the collaboration.

“Baton Rouge General’s participation in Entergy’s Power Through program is a great example of innovation and reliability working hand in hand,” said Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan of District 2. “By investing in backup power solutions, Entergy is helping critical facilities like hospitals stay prepared, protect patients and keep essential services running when our communities need them most.”

Commissioner Davante Lewis of District 3 added that the project strengthens both resilience and equity.

“Reliable energy isn’t a luxury. It’s a lifeline, especially for patients who depend on life-saving medical devices or refrigerated medication,” Lewis said. “Baton Rouge General’s Power Through project is a vital investment in both resilience and equity.”

Enchanted Rock supplied the generators that power BRG’s upgraded energy system. The two BRG sites feature 3.6 MW and 5.8 MW microgrids that provide resiliency for the two healthcare campuses. The systems, which are integrated into the existing natural gas pipeline network, can seamlessly disconnect from the grid and operate autonomously to ensure clean, continuous power.

“Reliable power means hospitals can focus on patients, not outages, and we are honored to play a part in keeping care continuous when it matters most,” said Jim Barbour, regional vice president of utilities at Enchanted Rock.

Natural gas microgrids are becoming a national model for critical facilities seeking stronger reliability without depending on diesel, and this project places BRG among the leaders in healthcare energy resilience.

With the new generators online, Baton Rouge General is better prepared than ever to deliver lifesaving care in any circumstance.

BARNETT, JONATHAN MARTIN, RICH BARLOW, Eric Bazail-Eimil",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/14/electric-vehicle-ev-charging-stations-biden-00641188,"In June, I arrived at RS Automotive to meet David Moon, the Democratic majority leader of the Maryland State Assembly.
Charging stations are necessary to give potential EV buyers confidence that they can energize their vehicles on the go.
America’s artisanal EV charging system — calling it a ‘network’ is a stretch — had no national standards.
That’s because building an EV charging station is utterly unlike what DOTs usually do.
Industry veterans know that standing up an EV charging plaza is so complex that it often takes 18 months.","But when the election rolled around three years later, NEVI appeared to have accomplished little. A built-out federal network would have included thousands of charging plazas, but Biden had opened only 25 locations by the time he left office. (Buttigieg declined comment for this story. A spokesperson for Biden did not respond to a request for comment.)

Biden created the impression that federal efforts would yield swift results. But he also handed NEVI a heavy rucksack of secondary goals — like boosting union labor standards and competing with China — and let it loose into a maze of federal and state bureaucracy that drastically slowed construction.

But there’s more to it. Despite the obvious failures, NEVI is, in a sense, succeeding.

Beyond the raw number of chargers they wanted to build, Biden’s people had an overriding goal: to take the glitchy, frustrating experience of EV charging and transform it into a smooth operation that could supersize across the nation’s highways. To do that, they sought to establish a common set of rules and requirements that would spur the many actors of the charging world to coordinate so that all drivers — not just Tesla owners — could count on a charging experience that, well, works.

By that goal, NEVI is working.

Biden didn’t get to campaign on the success of shiny new chargers at highway exits. But by insisting that EV drivers get the same plug-in and payment experience regardless of where they go, his administration did lay the groundwork for the EV revolution of tomorrow — even if he won’t get credit for it.

NEVI “forced the entire industry to raise its game around reliability, redundancy and performance that will be remembered as an important legacy,” said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which studies the EV charging network.

It’s a political failure that morphed into a policy success. This curious path holds intriguing lessons for a Democratic Party that just won a series of promising elections and is contemplating how to govern on its next turn in power.

Within the party, there’s a debate over the so-called “abundance” agenda offered by liberal journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson in their much-talk-about book. Their thesis, in a nutshell, is that Democrats admirably care about all sorts of things — but that often prevents them from getting results on anything. They can’t build high-speed rail in California, for example, because they need years of environmental studies and community-impact statements. If they want to win, abundance-advocates say, Democrats need to cut the red tape and stick a shovel in the ground.

NEVI in particular became a target of the abundance crowd. On comedian Jon Stewart’s podcast, Klein bemoaned the fact that, despite billions of dollars passed for EV chargers, “by the end of the administration, they just have not happened.” For Klein, the question facing Democrats is whether they can shake off their affinity for bureaucracy and persuade the American people that they can actually get things done — and NEVI is a clear example of their failure to do so.

But it’s not quite so simple. In fact, NEVI has endured where so many other Biden policies have met their end in the Trump administration in part because of the bureaucratic arcana that made it a political loser.

On Inauguration Day, Trump announced that he would freeze NEVI, as he did with a host of programs dear to Democrats. But it turns out that Congress had written out the program in such specific detail — and had thrust it so deeply into Washington’s core spending programs — that Trump had little room to flout the legislative branch. NEVI not only survived a court challenge but was reluctantly adopted by the administration. While Trump has relaxed some of its most burdensome requirements, the core mission of constructing a federal charging network has endured, shielded by pages upon pages of Democratic legalisms and technicalities. In other words, NEVI survived because it was the wonky if ungainly child of bureaucracy that Democrats are so good at creating.

In June, I arrived at RS Automotive to meet David Moon, the Democratic majority leader of the Maryland State Assembly. He showed up in his first all-electric ride, a black Kia EV.

Moon got interested in EV policy when he took a road trip to Florida with his wife. Like so many others, he was dismayed by how many highway chargers simply didn’t work. It was, he said, “really eye opening.”

When he got back home to Maryland, he drove around to see what electric stations were available, especially in more remote areas like Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore. Within an hour’s drive from Washington, he found that most hotels, even the new ones, didn’t have a charger on site. The cities frequented by EV-driving tourists had few stations, and many were broken.

“Our state was nowhere near … the charging infrastructure to sustain the lofty policy goals we had installed elsewhere,” he told me.

Those goals are mostly about climate change, a threat that concerns many of Moon’s constituents. Cars and trucks are one of the largest sources of carbon emissions contributing to climate change, and scientists predict that, as the atmosphere warms and glaciers melt, rising sea levels will one day inundate Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay shoreline.

For a decade now, the threats of climate change have led Maryland and other liberal states to subsidize charging stations. These unglamorous plug points are a weak spot in any EV transition. Charging stations are necessary to give potential EV buyers confidence that they can energize their vehicles on the go. But since they are at first little-used and generate low revenue, it’s been hard for station builders to thrive while they wait for more customers. Governments have tried to propel charging stations across this valley of death by covering all or part of a station’s construction costs.

The biggest recipient of such aid in Maryland is the Electric Vehicle Institute (EV Institute), which operates the charging station at RS Automotive that Moon and I were about to use. Between 2015 and 2022, this home-grown Maryland EV-charging company received almost $6.3 million of aid from the Maryland Energy Administration, which runs several programs to subsidize charging stations, according to a tally by E&E News. In all, state money bankrolled more than 300 EV Institute locations. That includes $958,000 that in 2017 helped construct fast chargers at two state-owned rest stops, Maryland House and Chesapeake House, that capture the traffic on Interstate 95 — the highway backbone between New York and Washington.

Today, those chargers along I-95 are leaving drivers frustrated. On review sites, users say that EV Institute’s chargers are often down. When they do work, they provide only 50 kilowatts of power, which could take more than an hour to charge a modern EV.

“Please boot these clowns outta here and install some modern charging infrastructure, MD!” a user named Adam posted this summer on Plugshare, an EV-charger review site. On a reporter’s visit to Maryland House this summer, one of EV Institute’s six stations was broken. None allowed for payment by smartphone app, since EV Institute has no app.

This experience is common at publicly funded charging stations across the country. Most charging stations funded by government grants haven’t been required to keep up to date with new technology — or even to keep functioning.

Back at the RS Automotive site, Moon and I were having little luck. Several cars were able to charge, but not mine. I plugged one connector into my rented Ford Mustang Mach-E, and then another. Neither of them worked, and there were no attendants around to ask for help.

Moon remembered a different EV Institute charger on a curb nearby. When we pulled up, we found it covered with graffiti, a piece of paper taped to its screen that said OUT OF ORDER. Moon apologized profusely and pointed me to another EV Institute charger at Takoma Park’s city hall. I futzed with each of the cables. Each box eventually delivered the screen message CHARGING FAILED. Moon shook his head.

“It’s a wild thing, how this is so typical,” he said. “Prime locations are being occupied by non-functioning charging.”

I would have liked to ask Matthew Wade, the EV Institute’s top executive, about these problems — but he didn’t reply to interview requests. More ominously, the customer-support phone number posted at every station is now disconnected. When I interviewed Wade two years ago at RS Automotive, my notes gave one reason the stations are so glitchy: They are difficult to repair. Wade told me that when an irate customer reports a failed session, the reason isn’t obvious. The culprit could be the hardware, the software, even the credit-card reader. Technicians with the skills to rebuild a high-voltage charging station were so rare that Wade had to fly them in from California.

“It’s far more complicated than just replacing some charging,” Wade said at the time.

The mediocre sessions at EV Institute’s stations on I-95 have a stark counterpoint. Just steps away are banks of Supercharger stations run by Tesla, the country’s leading EV automaker. The Tesla network is the country’s largest and fastest growing, but it isn’t everywhere, and is closed to most non-Tesla EVs on the road today. Unlike other EV owners, Tesla drivers can easily pay for sessions using an app, and chargers deliver 150 kilowatts in ideal conditions — three times as much as EV Institute’s. Users report they are almost always working.

Electrifying the Nation

Bringing Tesla-like efficiency to the country’s EV-charging system is what Andrew Wishnia had in mind in 2021 when he wrote the rules for what turned out to be NEVI.

As a senior policy adviser to the U.S. Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee, Wishnia drafted the climate-transportation portion of the bipartisan infrastructure law, one of Biden’s first big legislative accomplishments. Previously, he had been a climate adviser in the Obama White House, where he handled an effort to convert the nation’s 600,000-vehicle fleet to electric.

“Why can’t we do the same thing for our national highway system?” he asked.

The idea was to use federal money to form a backbone of charging stations along major highways. Chargers are proliferating in cities, where most EV drivers live, and are steadily starting to appear in more far-flung locations. But many gaps still exist on the rural stretches that make up the great American road trip. Charging providers avoid those lonely places because the customers are few.

Enter NEVI: The government would focus “on building where the private sector wouldn’t,” said Andrew Rogers, an official at the Federal Highway Administration who oversaw the program’s implementation.

That goal was concrete, easily understandable. But behind it stood a second one, harder for the public to grasp.

America’s artisanal EV charging system — calling it a ‘network’ is a stretch — had no national standards. Take Maryland as an example: EV Institute’s chargers were struggling because the company had to figure out big, systemic problems on its own. It couldn’t find repair workers because such workers barely existed, and few new recruits were on the horizon because no nationally recognized curriculum existed to train them. No payment system connected EV Institute’s chargers to other networks. Charging sessions often failed because the software and hardware that connected the car, the charger and the electric grid didn’t converse fluently; no industry-wide protocols gave them a common language.

“It was the wild, wild West,” said Loren McDonald, an independent analyst who studies the charging network. “No one was holding the industry accountable.”

Meanwhile, one part of the U.S. charging system was demonstrating the possible. Tesla’s Supercharger network was fast and reliable — but closed to non-Teslas.

The chance to tap funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law, in fact, is part of what spurred CEO Elon Musk to open Tesla chargers to others, and led to one of NEVI’s most wrenching mid-course corrections. In mid-2023, automakers stampeded to adopt Tesla’s charging standard, known as NACS, and that threw NEVI’s rules into confusion. While NEVI doesn’t require NACS, many non-Tesla EV drivers can now use Tesla’s network.

NEVI would use the lure of $5 billion from the federal government to spur other players to collectively achieve the same performance. It would bind the motley, disjointed parts of the EV ecosystem — its dozens of providers, its Frankenstein mix of hardware and software — into an interoperable whole. Operators could get billions of dollars of free money, but first, everyone would have to agree to certain rules.

Lots of rules.

‘They Were in Over Their Heads’

In Abundance, Klein and Thompson made the argument that Democrats can’t get things done because, over the decades, they have developed a knee-jerk belief that solutions lie in the elaborate machinery of government. As Thompson put it, they spend “too much time thinking about process and too little time thinking about outcomes.”

The outcome of NEVI — the part the public was supposed see — is easy enough to understand: a station every 50 miles along major highways, and no more than a mile from an offramp. They would work with any model of EV. Each location would have four dispensers, with minimum power of 150 kilowatts — three times faster than EV Institute’s stations in Maryland. In the end, America’s drivers would have an electric safety net that anyone could rely on.

But underneath that straightforward vision was a second aim that the public barely knew about: Wishnia’s ambition to remake the ramshackle system into an efficient, unified network. And that would involve a lot of process.

How would the government provide its $5 billion? The fast way would have been grants. But that risked the government creating yet another wave of orphaned and poorly maintained stations, like EV Institute’s. Instead, the infrastructure law took a different — but much slower — course.

The dollars would flow through the Federal-aid Highway Program, the big and lazy Mississippi River of federal transportation dollars. Uncle Sam bankrolls roughly a quarter of road and bridge work along 3.9 million miles of state and federal highways. The funds are doled out to state departments of transportation, which decide how to oversee the work according to their particular rules.

Wishnia said this was strategic: The feds would lend a guiding hand whilethe states got flexibility. Taxpayer dollars wouldn’t repeat the mistakes of the past. For example, Wishnia’s bill insisted that stations operate for at least five years. The vigil would be kept by state DOTs, which, after all, have kept the federal highway system running for nearly 70 years.

“We wanted EV charging infrastructure to be an integrated part of the broader transportation system,” Wishnia said. After all, this was the same funding formula that created the interstate highway system in the 1950s. He added, “It really had to go to state departments of transportation, so they had skin in the game.”

But there was a problem: State DOTs knew next to nothing about EV charging stations. The federal government would fill that gap too, by trying something never attempted in the republic’s two centuries. Every agency in the U.S. government is run by a single federal department. Congress would break that precedent by creating a new unit with two parents.

An electric vehicle is two things. One is transportation, which is a complex system. The other is electricity, which is a complex system of a very different kind — one that until recently has not provided power for millions of vehicles. So Congress created the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, or JOET. The Transportation Department would oversee the funding. The Energy Department, with its bench of experts at the national labs, would provide the electrical expertise.

But Wishnia left one rule out: a deadline for states to finish the job. And that would prove politically disastrous for the Biden administration.

‘Nobody Seemed to Understand the Timeline’

Gabe Klein, the founding executive director of JOET, remembers a meeting he had with the White House soon after he took his job in late 2022. He was worried about expectations.

“Nobody seemed to understand the timeline to build heavy infrastructure like DC fast chargers,” he told me. (Fast chargers, like those on highways, use DC, or direct current.) As for NEVI’s timeline, he told the White House, “We’re going to see sort of the pinnacle of chargers going in, we hope, 2027, ’28” — long after the end of Biden’s first term.

Klein saw that NEVI had taken something already time-consuming — the building of a fast-charging station — and baked it into an intricate bureaucratic layer cake.

The process started with the states. Knowing the amount of money they would get, they had to submit to the Federal Highway Administration a detailed annual plan

Those plans then needed federal review, which was completed in late 2022. With plans in hand, states were free to get started — or at least to start getting started. States typically plan for big projects in stages. It’s a slow process that in this case would be even slower. That’s because building an EV charging station is utterly unlike what DOTs usually do.

“We’re good at building roads, we’re good at building bridges, we’re good at maintenance and things like that,” said Lyle McMillan, a technology director with the Utah Department of Transportation, at a meeting of state officials last year in Detroit. With NEVI, he said, “We’ve been basically tasked with creating a new product, a new something, and doing it on the fly — and still meeting 2,000 different rules that are in place to do it.”

The first weird thing for state DOTs to wrap their heads around was that the stations were located not on the highway, but off it, on private land they didn’t control. No one even knew what land it would be. First the DOT or its private partners had to find a “site host” that met the feds’ strict rule of being no more than a mile from the highway — think of a restaurant or gas station. But to complicate things, these retail outlets often had no skills or interest in building or operating the charger itself. That would fall to a third entity, the charging provider.

These sites would need a startling 600 kilowatts of power to charge cars quickly — far more than what is often available on the roadside. New and stronger wires needed to be built by the electric utility — an entity that can rival a state DOT for its ponderous, bureaucratic ways.

Industry veterans know that standing up an EV charging plaza is so complex that it often takes 18 months. Even Tesla, the industry leader, can take two years. And a special circumstance made the timeline even longer: The snarled supply chains during the recovery from the pandemic meant that getting an electrical transformer, key to supplying the station’s power, could take three years.

It all would have been challenging enough without the stacks of rules that vexed McMillan of the Utah DOT.

He referred to Title 23, the 818-page regulatory bible that dictates how states can spend federal transportation dollars — and overlays with other federal rules and regulations that Congress passed in bygone eras.

For example, companies doing the work must meet minimum wage rules created in the 1930s to yank the country out of the Great Depression. Another Depression-era proviso requires contractors to audit their financial statements and post bonds to ensure their work. And don’t forget the National Environmental Policy Act, passed in the smog-filled year of 1969, that includes lengthy checklists to ensure a project causes minimum harm to land, water and air.

These rules, though burdensome, are a well-worn groove for the handful of engineering firms and general contractors that are big and deep-pocketed enough to build a highway or bridge. But none of this describes the motley scrum of companies that approached states hoping to build the NEVI charging stations. They were mostly startups with short histories and unaudited books.

The charging industry was as frustrated as McMillan and his DOT peers. In addition to navigating the regulatory mazes of Title 23, they found that every state had its own unique practices for digesting federal dollars.

“You’re starting over every time in learning a state’s procurement process,” said Andrew Dick, a business development manager at Electrify America, one of the country’s largest charging networks.

“The industry general perception is that they were in over their heads, moving too slowly, and requiring things that didn’t need to be required,” said one charging-company official granted anonymity to speak candidly about industry-related matters.

‘Do You Want Ribbons Cut or Not?’

As states and industry swam through the molasses of Title 23, they had an urgent question for the federal government: What are the details of this new and improved network you want us to build?

Those details would form a second set of slowing agents, in part because the answers wandered beyond NEVI’s infrastructure mandate and into a controversy between union labor and climate advocates. New rules would only deepen the quicksand builders needed to trudge through — until the White House realized, too late, that it hadn’t delivered the charging network that America expected.

Every federal NEVI guideline would benefit or inconvenience someone. The referee would be JOET, charged with creating a network that would be both cutting-edge and reasonable.

But JOET presented a different kind of obstacle to the quick progress Biden promised for NEVI: It was so brand-new that it barely existed. Klein, a former head of transportation departments in Chicago and Washington, wasn’t hired until almost a year after the infrastructure law passed. Dick, of Electrify America, described JOET’s ascent as “building the plane as you fly it.”

Bureaucratic infighting was inevitable. JOET and its experts sat in the Department of Energy. But the states’ marching orders came from the Federal Highway Administration, part of the Department of Transportation. State officials interviewed for this story gave JOET high marks for its expertise but said FHWA’s management of charging-station dollars was slow and inconsistent.

By early 2023, JOET had its final rules ready. In a 35,000-word document, it explained how software and hardware systems would interoperate, harmonized pricing and payment systems, and set standards for cybersecurity and reliability.

By early 2023, a year and a half after the bill was passed, the NEVI program had become a maelstrom of process, with little in the way of outcomes. The 2024 election was heating up, and officials had only a handful of EV-station openings to celebrate.

Jonathan Levy, the former chief commercial officer at EVgo, a provider of charging stations, remembers going to the White House to meet with Biden’s infrastructure team and asking, “Do you want ribbons cut or not? Because at the pace you’re going, nothing is going to get cut.”

It was a deficiency that Klein, at the Joint Office, knew too well. He was getting an earful from states and industry about how hard it was to meet the labyrinth challenges of Title 23.

“We were constantly kicking everybody in the ass, escalating things to the secretaries and deputies at the White House,” he said. “We were sounding alarms that things weren’t going well.”

‘A Vast Administrative Failure’

In late 2023, POLITICO was the first media outlet to note that NEVI had not opened a single charging station. Other media picked up on the story, and by June, Trump started putting criticism of NEVI into rotation at his rallies, suggesting that the program’s slow pace called Biden’s competence into question. It also boiled up in Congress, where Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a Biden ally, labeled NEVI a “vast administrative failure.”

The White House at last realized it had a crisis in the making. Administration officials started hitting the phones, pleading for speed.

“Because it was in the press so often, it had higher visibility, so we were pushing our cabinet members and governors pretty hard,” said Samantha Silverberg, a top Biden infrastructure adviser.

States’ progress on NEVI did not follow a neat red-blue divide. Ohio, a Republican-led state, was the fastest to open stations, as the administration of Gov. Mike DeWine (R) made it a high priority. Other red states moved slowly, if at all: Wyoming flatly refused to build stations in its big empty spaces, while Florida’s governor, then-presidential candidate Ron DeSantis (R), proudly did nothing with the NEVI money. His transportation secretary, Jared Perdue, said that Biden’s EV plans “politicize the nation’s transportation infrastructure.”

The deep-blue states of Washington state and Oregon were standing still, and other blue states were slogging. But the White House had little leverage. As it turns out, handing decision-making power to the states to get their buy-in had a downside. “The control is almost entirely in the hands of the states,” said Silverberg, and they “were not under the gun to spend that money quickly.”

The White House did prod Maryland, which like most states didn’t open a single NEVI station during Biden’s term. Joe McAndrew, the state’s assistant Transportation secretary, said the state barely budged on the program under former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. The governor’s attitude on NEVI, McAndrew said, was, “if we never spend the dollars, can we just give it back?” (Hogan said through a spokesperson that his administration worked hard to get the infrastructure law passed and “followed all procedures in the law.”) Under Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who took office in 2023, NEVI plans started moving.

When Washington asked for speed, however, even Maryland had to shrug. It was wending through the many rules that slow down any federal transportation project, like approvals through the National Environmental Protection Act. To name one example, Maryland had to demonstrate that its stations’ lights, meant for user safety, didn’t shine into any nearby forests.

“We unfortunately were not in position,” McAndrew said, “that we could accelerate to meet any type of November schedule.”

Trump Takes Over

Last summer, nine months after defeating Biden in the presidential election and six months after freezing the NEVI program, the Trump administration did something rare: It relented, re-opening the funding spigots and reluctantly making the program its own, while relaxing some of the Biden-era rules.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” said Sean Duffy, Trump’s Transportation secretary.

Duffy threw out the Biden administration’s 35,000 words of NEVI guidance and replaced them with a brief, 2,500-word document “to allow states to actually build EV chargers.” Gone was the dictum to build stations every 50 miles. States, not the feds, would declare when their charging network is finished. Money could be used to charge not just cars, but big trucks, too.

Some EV advocates who typically criticized the Trump administration found themselves praising it. They were relieved, not just that the administration’s long NEVI freeze was over, but that a looser regime could get NEVI moving. “We appreciate the Department’s efforts to streamline the program,” said the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes EVs.

Even Wishnia, the author of NEVI, said he approved of Trump relaxing some of the voluminous guidance that the Biden administration had written.

“We’re now in a position where we can give states more latitude,” he said.

Success at Last

After a torturous birth under Biden and a near-death experience under Trump, NEVI is starting to hit its stride.

State departments of transportation have wrapped their heads around charging infrastructure; money is flowing, and stations are under construction. Analysts expect that thousands of NEVI-funded chargers may be online, as JOET director Klein predicted, by 2027 or 2028. In Maryland, DOT officials say the first wave of 22 stations will be online by this time next year.

NEVI runs out of funding next year, and it’s unknown if the next big transportation bill will include money for EV charging. But whether it does or not, NEVI’s less publicized goal — that of spurring a well-functioning charging system with common standards — is becoming a commercial reality.

In Maryland, at least four large charging plazas are under construction near highways. None rely on federal aid. The scale of new, privately funded stations makes NEVI’s footprint seem quaint. They have more ports and refill batteries faster. Stations are being used more frequently, and reliability is improving. An October study by Paren, an EV-charging consultancy, projected that the U.S. will open almost 17,000 fast-charging ports this year.

“They’re not waiting for NEVI,” said Lanny Hartmann, a charging advocate in Maryland. “They’re just going to build them.”

Despite their initial resistance to NEVI’s rules, some industry leaders now credit it for bringing them together.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fce%2F0b%2Fe53982da491d9ead51c05cfd122d%2Fmag-ferris-evwins-override.png,N,,2025-11-14 06:59:15.858394

Thirteen community members attended the meeting to discuss emerging opportunities for student engagement and workforce development.

School administrators across the county have actively promoted the upcoming Youth Business Showcase, scheduled for Nov. 22, encouraging student participation and entrepreneurial engagement. Seven youth businesses are currently registered to attend and present. The showcase offers a platform for students to share business ideas, demonstrate innovation, and connect with local professionals.

Additionally, the county schools are ramping up efforts to connect students with career exploration tools and real-world experiences, thanks to a coordinated push involving the YouScience aptitude data, and regional partnerships.

To support individualized career pathways, schools are using the data to help students identify strengths, aptitudes, and potential career matches. These insights are guiding conversations around course selection, post-secondary planning, and career readiness.

Missy McClurg, superintendent at the Western Buckeye Educational Service Center (ESC), is facilitating outreach to all three county school districts — Paulding, Antwerp, and Wayne Trace — ensuring administrators are informed and supported in trialing and implementing these initiatives.

Paulding School reported grades 7-12 are set to host a career exploration event next week, bringing together students and local employers. In addition, the after-school welding cohort, which was not offered last year, is coming back to Paulding High School following the holidays.

Participating students will receive certificates of completion in blueprint reading, basic welding, and yellow belt safety training.

Antwerp Junior High School is planning a similar event in February for middle school students.

This first-time opportunity will also allow students to interact with businesses from around the region.

Wayne Trace Local School continues to analyze how the new STEAM Center will be developed there, whether that will be implemented into the current building, or if there will be additional space built to house the tools used in the programming. Students participating in the STEAM program will be presenting at the Paulding County Business & Industry Recognition Banquet on Nov. 18.

All three county schools participated in the “Build Your Future” event held in Van Wert. Vantage Career Center program directors and students, along with regional businesses, offered hands-on skill opportunities for students to attempt in health care, safety, electricity, HVAC, welding, drywall, heavy equipment, masonry and other programs. Partnered with Paulding and Van Wert Economic Development offices, the scheduling and improvements are already being determined for the 2026 event.

Michael Burkholder, workforce specialist with the office of Ohio Workforce Development, shared information on Ohio TechCred, a state program that reimburses employers for upskilling their workforce through short-term, technology-focused credentials. Schools were encouraged to explore how TechCred tools can benefit teachers and administrative staff, further aligning education with evolving workforce needs.

Rhodes State and Northwest State Colleges were on hand to share updates in regard to their respective colleges for both high school student and adult learners.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

The Japanese automaker also confirmed an additional $10 billion investment over the next five years, taking its total commitment in the United States to more than $60 billion.

The facility, Toyota’s eleventh in the country, spans 1,850 acres and will eventually employ 5,000 people. At full capacity, it will produce 30 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually, supporting hybrid versions of the Camry, RAV4, and Corolla Cross, as well as an upcoming all-electric, three-row SUV.

By Akshat Rathi and Kevin Crowley

When you’re one of the biggest polluters, you have a vested interest in how pollution is counted. That is why ExxonMobil has joined an industry effort to create a new carbon-accounting system, which it claims could enable more accurate calculations of emissions-intensity at a product level. Climate advocates say it’s yet another delay tactic.

But Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods says it’s not. “If you want to eliminate all the emissions, you damn well better be able to account for all of them,” he said in an interview for the Zero podcast, speaking last week from the sidelines of preliminary events tied to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. It’s his third consecutive trip linked to the United Nations-sponsored global climate meeting, and he’s putting the oil and gas giant’s weight behind what he thinks is a necessary climate solution.

“I’m a big believer,” Woods said, “that 20% of products or services are causing 80% of the emissions. Let’s start by focusing on those.” The new accounting mechanism is a “critical first step” that would shift responsibility onto the person or business who burns a fuel such as gasoline, rather than the company that produces it.

Exxon’s willingness to engage in ideas to reduce emissions is a departure from its historical stance, which has included advertorials sowing doubt about climate science that ran in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Woods, the company has been trying to change its image and is investing billions of dollars in low-carbon technologies. That process continues, albeit a little slowly, even as US President Donald Trump’s all-out attack on renewables and promotion of fossil fuels has made some question the transition to clean energy.

While Woods praised Trump for changing the “paradigms” of the energy transition, he insisted Exxon still has a role to play in lowering emissions. “We need a broader aperture. That set of solutions is more focused on the opportunity to address the real challenge here, which is emissions,” he said in São Paulo the week before climate diplomats and tens of thousands of participants arrived in the rainforest city of Belém for COP30.

Exxon, along with its allies in the Middle East and now the White House, is increasingly trying to redefine the energy transition to include a long-term future for oil and gas and a market-led approach to low carbon. Under political pressure from the US, the world’s foremost energy forecaster, the Paris-based International Energy Agency has re-introduced a scenario that assumes a slower roll out of clean-energy technologies and thus rising demand for fossil fuels for decades to come. That’s a radically different world than what happens if governments adopt the policies they’ve stated in their climate plans under the Paris Agreement — a world where oil and gas consumption would peak around 2030.

Most of Woods’ CEO peers in the oil and gas industry have stopped making the annual trip to climate summits, but Woods has become a veteran by now after trips COP28 in Dubai and COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. It raises the question of what he wants to accomplish by engaging the climate world.

As the poster-child of climate obstruction for nearly two decades, Exxon lost a high-profile activist campaign at the height of the environmental, social and governance movement in 2021. Woods, who was forced to replace a quarter of his board after the proxy battle, now engages willingly in climate debates to elevate his views, even if that means facing a skeptical, even hostile audience. The company plans to invest $30 billion in low-carbon technologies through 2030 but with a focus on businesses like carbon capture and hydrogen that can sit alongside fossil fuels rather than replace them.

Exxon’s record profits in 2022, less than a year after the acrimonious proxy battle, only hardened his resolve to defend fossil fuels not only in today’s energy system but for decades into the future. Woods insists Exxon can help to cut emissions but only if it can do so by reducing the carbon intensity of the overall energy system while continuing to grow oil and gas production.

Criticizing ideologues “on both sides,” Woods said he wants a clean break from government-led accords that mandate emissions reductions by banning or restricting fossil fuels, which are responsible for most human-made global warming. That position can be seen as self-serving — Exxon is developing enormous new sources of offshore oil in Guyana, whose production will continue for decades — but it’s also influential. The Texas-based company’s vision of the future now has loud supporters in the White House, who are attempting to pin the blame for rising energy costs on low-carbon power in an effort to erode a long-held global consensus on climate action.

The battle is likely to become increasingly fraught during Trump’s remaining three years in office as the price at the plug replaces the price at the pump as a growing pain point in household budgets. “You see even in Europe that the cost of energy has gotten so high that they’re stepping back and rethinking what needs to happen in order to achieve their emissions reductions while continuing to provide affordable energy and reliably available energy,” Woods said.

Many at COP, who supported climate action when Exxon was against it, have reasons to be skeptical of the company now. Apart from activities to sow doubt about climate science, Exxon was also an outspoken critic of the Kyoto protocol in the late 1990s and the cap-and-trade effort to reduce emissions a decade later.

And today, there’s an increasing likelihood that Exxon’s recent low-carbon efforts may fall short. Woods plans to “pace” his low-carbon hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, that was announced with much fanfare two years ago under former US President Joe Biden. Analysts are speculating that the company may even reduce its spending plans on green energy at its annual investor day next month.

Woods said the project is being held back by a lack of customer demand rather than Trump’s shortening of subsidies for hydrogen. “One of the big challenges there is customers buying the product,” he said.

Exxon thinks the solution is an accounting system that can be used to sell products of lower carbon intensity. But climate science is clear that lowering the amount of carbon emitted per unit, rather than the absolute volume of emissions, won’t achieve reductions quickly enough to arrest global warming. A dramatic phase-down of fossil fuels, and substitution for renewable energy, is needed to avoid catastrophic climate impacts.

Carbon Measures, the new carbon accounting system Exxon is backing alongside BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners and chemicals giant BASF SE and Banco Santander SA, aims to provide more accurate assessments of direct emissions. That category includes all energy used across a company’s assets. The methodology would do away with indirect emissions, known in the current measurement system as Scope 3, which include those that come from customers using a company’s products. It’s a big change when one of your major products is fuel burned inside automobiles.

The main goal is to avoid double-counting of emissions, which is baked into the current corporate carbon accounting system called the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. While Woods says customers’ emissions are not Exxon’s responsibility, the backers of GHG Protocol say double-counting is a feature not a bug. When multiple entities take responsibility for the same emissions, there’s a greater chance of them working together to cut those emissions.

“When Exxon is out front pushing for ‘better’ disclosure, we should honestly reflect,” said Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. “We know exactly where emissions come from and, in fact, Exxon has been the single largest investor-owned emitter in the world.”

The other issue with Carbon Measures is that reaching accurate product-level emissions would need all players in the supply chain of production to report emissions. That could take years or even decades. The GHG Protocol is nearly 25 years old and already counts more than 20,000 companies reporting under its guidance.

Woods wants Exxon to play a role in the climate fight regardless. “There’s something that needs to be done in this space,” Woods said. “We have a role to play and can contribute and we will work with whatever administration comes in and continue to drive an agenda that we think makes sense that doesn’t compromise economic growth or people’s standards of living.”

Welcome to Zero, I’m Akshat Rathi. Today: Exxon at COP30

It’s been a year of bad news for climate policies. The biggest force has been Donald Trump, who, in his second term as US president, has systematically dismantled climate action at home and made concerted efforts to attack climate initiatives abroad. He has championed fossil fuels, and single-handedly slowed down the energy transition… at least in the US.

Trump’s actions have given license to many to ignore and deny climate change. But the CEO of ExxonMobil Darren Woods isn’t quite following suit.

Darren’s peers, the CEOs of other international oil companies, have stopped coming to COP climate summits. But Darren came to a side event at COP30 – his third COP in a row.

For context, Exxon is one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies. And Darren is in charge of overseeing its operations, and what areas of the energy transition the company pursues, or ignores.

Last year at COP29 in Baku, I got a chance to ask him questions about how Exxon – which has a long history of sowing doubt about climate science – can be trusted to now be acting in good faith to tackle climate change.

I quizzed him on Exxon’s lobbying efforts and on the oil industry’s favorite climate solution: carbon capture. I also talked to him about the millions of dollars Exxon spent advertising algae biofuels, without ever scaling up the technology for commercial use.

If you haven’t listened, I recommend you do, and we’ll link the episode in the show notes. Because this year I wanted to ask him different questions, and follow up on some of the questions I had last year.

Why is Exxon backing a new carbon accounting idea, which many climate advocates worry is yet another delay tactic? What is his plan now that many of the tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act for low-carbon solutions have been gutted? And how is he planning to deal with the tactics that Trump is using to go after businesses… that could be weaponized against his industry by a future administration?

As you will hear, it was a good conversation with a healthy amount of disagreement. These are the kinds of conversations I’d like to see happen more often, where we aren’t questioning the accepted science of climate change, but debating the ways in which we should act quickly.

Akshat Rathi 2:50

Welcome back to Zero, Darren.

Darren Woods 2:52

It’s good to be back.

Akshat Rathi 2:54

So I know your schedule is always very tight, but you are in Brazil. Have you ever been to the Amazon before? Have you been to a rainforest before?

Darren Woods 3:00

I’ve been to a rainforest before, but not the Amazon.

Akshat Rathi 3:02

Maybe next time.

Darren Woods 3:03

Maybe next time. Yeah, I’d like that.

Akshat Rathi 3:07

So it’s been a year since Donald Trump’s election. He’s been in office for 10 months, and there’s been a radical shift in policies, obviously, in the US, away from climate action and in favor of fossil fuels. What changes have you liked?

Darren Woods 3:23

Well, I think to me, what I focus on is the dialog that’s occurring and the fact that there’s a debate, and I’d say a challenge to some of the paradigms that have been established as to how best to accomplish this objective. If you think about the whole effort in this space, it’s been defined, frankly, by a set of solutions that have been proposed by a lot of ideologues, primarily on the left, that this is the way we’re going to solve the problem with this set of solutions. And I think unfortunately, the problem and the challenge of climate change has then been defined by this solution set in either you’re for these solutions or against them. And I think what we need to do is focus less on the proposed solutions. Some of them are valid and have merit, and they’re necessary, but they’re not sufficient. We need a broader aperture. And so less focus on that set of solutions, more focused on the opportunity to address the real challenge here, which is emissions. And so I actually like the fact there’s a debate going on, both sides of the argument. And I think generally speaking, when you have people debating about how best to achieve an outcome or to balance one challenge or issue with the other challenges and issues, that’s an important dialog and debate to have. And I feel more of that’s happening today in the US than in the past.

Akshat Rathi 4:41

Well, there are ideologues on the left, but there are ideologues on the right too.

Darren Woods 4:45

Ideologues on both sides, absolutely, yeah.

Akshat Rathi 4:48

Many of the things that have happened under the Trump administration are things that the oil and gas industry as a whole doesn’t like. The API (American Petroleum Institute) came out in support of keeping the greenhouse gas reporting, which the EPA wants to get rid of, for example. But you told me last year that you liked a lot of what was there in the Inflation Reduction Act, and obviously under the Trump administration, that’s been gutted. Almost all of the incentives that were there are gone. Does that change your thesis on the investments that you were looking forward to making in all sorts of low carbon solutions, like carbon capture, like hydrogen?

Darren Woods 5:22

So I think what we talked about last year, what we’ve been very focused on, is how can we contribute to the challenge of emissions and reducing emissions based on our capabilities and our core competitive advantages. And that’s very much focused on the molecule side of the equation: So carbon capture and storage, low-carbon or virtually carbon-free hydrogen, biofuels. We ended up moving into lithium based on our ability to process produced water, brine water. All those frankly, if you look at the changes the Trump administration has made to the IRA, have not reduced the incentives for those. But I will tell you that as you look at those different areas that were focused on, we always said that our investment in this space was a function of good policy, policy that incentivizes that in the short term, but very importantly, for markets developing and for there to be a customer demand. Because ultimately, any of these policies, to be successful, are going to have to evolve into market driven forces. Government can’t afford to subsidize these solutions in perpetuity, and so markets have to develop, and technology needs to evolve so that we can get the cost down. Because today, in some of these areas, the costs are too high for the long term. And so those three things have to happen. They have to improve. And we’re going to pace the investments associated with what we see in the development there. Frankly, with our largest project, the Baytown blue hydrogen project, one of the big challenges there is customers buying the product, and so we are potentially going to pace that based on our ability to sign customers up, much less a policy issue in that case.

Akshat Rathi 6:54

But you started by saying, in terms of getting climate solutions, or solutions that would reduce emissions, being technology neutral, the starting point, having policies, is helpful. In the US, you get the swing to the left and to the right. How much does that worry you?

Darren Woods 7:11

Well, your point about there being ideologues on either side of the aisle, I definitely agree with that. That’s why we shouldn’t be trying to solve this problem through ideology. I mean, ideology only takes you so far, and then you hit the reality of the real world, you know the practical constraints and how you manage through those. And I think from our perspective, we’re trying to keep a very clear view on what is the problem statement, which is trying to find ways to productively reduce emissions that don’t slow economic growth, that don’t impact people’s standards of living. Find ways to do that based on what we’re good at, and achieve both. We refer to it as the ‘and equation’, and we’re absolutely convinced that we can do that. And that dialogue that I have and the work that we’re doing is consistent, whether it’s a left administration or a right administration, or whether it’s an ideologue or somebody who’s center, the foundational fundamentals of how we address this issue over time do not change with political cycles or who gets elected.

Akshat Rathi 8:06

You told me last year that, given the scale of the energy transition, no single president in any country can do much to derail or to accelerate the energy transition. Do you still feel the same, given how effective Trump has been at stifling clean energy projects? This is not just clean hydrogen projects, but also carbon capture projects, obviously, lots and lots of offshore wind projects that were canceled. Are you still of the same view that one president cannot shift the pace of the energy transition?

Darren Woods 8:42

What I would say is: the energy industry, the basis on which we make decisions, the timeframe that those decisions play themselves out, and the duration of those investments exceed any political cycle. So my point is that we have to look beyond the political cycle in terms of making these decisions. I think one of the things the Trump administration is challenging is a parameter that, frankly, has not been given the attention it needs, which is the affordability of these things. And you know, is it a productive use of money? The challenge today is there’s not a policy maker around that can tell you what is the cost for the benefit of a ton of carbon removed. And every government has its constraints and limits. Every organization has its constraints. We don’t have unlimited budgets. And so I think every government around the world should be focused on, how do you get the biggest bang for the buck? How do I remove the most emissions for the least spend? You can’t do that today because we have no carbon accounting mechanism, no mechanism to understand the benefits of the policy. So as a result, we get very expensive solution sets that, frankly, aren’t sustainable. And so I think stepping back and trying to understand what are the economics, the underlying cost and the affordability of some of these solutions, is a critical part to laying the right foundation for the future. And I think challenging that today to try to get to better solutions is appropriate.

Akshat Rathi 10:06

Specifically, though, how do you feel about Trump canceling offshore wind permits? Projects that were fully permitted, some were under construction. There’s a risk another president comes in, who’s left leaning, who’s for clean energy, and uses the kind of policy and weaponizes it against oil and gas projects.

Darren Woods 10:29

Well, we’ve certainly seen that with Biden. He came in and canceled the pipeline coming from Canada. So you’re absolutely right. That challenge sits on both sides of the aisle. And I think, frankly, for businesses to be successful, particularly businesses like ours that invest very large sums of money over a very long horizon, you need stability. You need predictability. And so I think that’s one of the challenges that we have today with permitting, is the way it can be challenged, the way it can be changed, challenged through the legal system. And so I think a reform in that whole area is very appropriately focused. As you advance these things, you advance projects, you get the permit, you have to have confidence that those permits are going to continue to exist and allow you to make those investments. I think that’s critical for every industry, every business and for every government.

Akshat Rathi 11:12

You had also told me last year that if the energy transition provides opportunities outside the US, you will pursue those in the US. It’s pretty clear the energy transition is going to slow down. It’s not going to stop. We know that electric car sales are going to rise, just not as much as was predicted. Solar and wind projects will get deployed, but if you look outside the US, even there, the Trump administration is having an impact. So one thing that Exxon has long supported is carbon pricing. Ideally, you would want a global carbon price that would be a level playing field for everybody. We were about to get that. The politics have been very difficult around carbon pricing, but at the International Maritime Organization, there was a vote to have a global carbon tax on shipping. Were you supportive of the net zero framework there?

Darren Woods 12:01

So just to the first point that you made around things have slowed down, if you actually look at what the Trump administration did with the bill and legislation, incentives for carbon capture and storage remain. In fact, they increased them for enhanced oil recovery. And so there is a scenario that says more carbon is captured and sequestered through enhanced oil recovery as well as sequestration under the Trump administration, because the incentive for that has gone up. And for low-carbon hydrogen, the incentive remains there, it’s just a shorter time horizon. So I don’t think you can jump immediately to ‘there’s going to be less investments made in low carbon.’ I think it’ll be a question of where that low carbon sits. So keep an open mind with respect to where the opportunities present themselves. It’s not as, I think, black and white as you point out.

Akshat Rathi 12:41

On carbon capture, specifically, the environmental protection agency wants to get rid of the greenhouse gas reporting at the asset level, which is crucial to get your 45Q tax credit that would enable carbon capture projects to go forward. Doesn’t that change your investment thesis if you’re not able to tap into the 45Q tax credit, even if it’s available to you, because you can’t do the carbon accounting?

Darren Woods 13:03

Yeah, I think that’s right, but I think also the Trump administration is supportive of 45Q. And so I think the question is: what mechanism gets put in place to allow that to happen? And that story hasn’t been written yet, but we’re very actively involved in terms of, how can we do this. We were supportive of continuing to report emissions. We think it’s important that that happens, and so we’ve got to find an alternative, if not that, to ensure that we can report on those emissions. So yeah, that is critical.

Akshat Rathi 13:30

And on the energy transition slowing down, this is not my analysis. This is analysis done by different groups, Rhodium Group, BloombergNEF. It’s more to do with the speed at which low carbon stuff will get deployed. And so emissions reductions, which is what matters, which is what you know, a lot of the low carbon work that you do is aimed at is going to slow down as a result of the policies that have been brought in. So maybe carbon capture doesn’t get affected, because 45Q will be sorted out, but so many solar and wind projects have been canceled. So the energy transition does slow down in the US.

Darren Woods 14:02

I think it slows down in Europe as well. I think actually what you see happening around the world is that the incentives that people have put in place, and frankly, some of the impractical aspects of the policy that have been put in place and have been rolling out, is starting to manifest itself. And so you see, even in Europe, that the cost of energy has gotten so high that they’re stepping back and rethinking what needs to happen in order to achieve their emissions reductions while continuing to provide affordable energy and reliably available energy. So there’s a broader recognition that’s needed that these solution sets that are out there today have their limits. And to blindly follow those and to assume that that is the only solution, and not step back and think more broadly about what else can be done to address the issue, is going to slow it down. Everywhere in the world, the practical aspects of the problems associated with some of the solutions being proposed, the deeper you penetrate it, the more manifest those become. That’s going to slow things down.

Akshat Rathi 15:01

But one of those was having a global carbon price, at least on shipping, which the International Maritime Organization and the countries in it were going to vote for. Were you supportive of that?

Darren Woods 15:12

Yeah, actually, as a concept having a price on carbon, we’ve always thought that a global price on carbon is an effective way to control emissions. To the extent that governments around the world want to control those emissions, I think with climate change in particular, as you think back, governments are put in place, are elected, to represent their people, and so that’s what you see happening around the world. I don’t have a perspective on what government should or shouldn’t be doing, their obligation is to their people. What I focus on is not the what, but the how best to achieve it.

Akshat Rathi 15:43

But as part of the industry, which is not just you, ExxonMobil, but you support a lot of lobbying organizations that speak the voice of the industry as a whole, was the industry supportive of the carbon tax on shipping, because…

Darren Woods 15:56

We were not advocating against it.

Akshat Rathi 16:01

What we saw was an extraordinary attempt by the US administration. This is, again, not my words, but we’ve spoken to lots of diplomats who were there in the room who said that those activities were extraordinary, that there were not just threats made at the country level, which were public and were published on the White House website, but also personal threats, visa restrictions or individual sanctions, which caused many of them to then really rethink whether they would go forward with the vote. If you get another chance to have a global carbon price, how would you speak to the Trump administration, and how would you get them to change their mind on something that they currently aren’t supportive of?

Darren Woods 16:40

Yeah, I’m not familiar with all the things you talked about, so I don’t know if that happened or not, and I certainly wasn’t involved in the Trump administration and their dialog on this. So I can’t pretend to know the complexity of the discussions that were happening. What I would tell you is what we have consistently advocated for — with the Biden administration, with the Trump administration — is what thoughtful policies can be put in place to help reduce emissions that don’t compromise economic growth, that don’t penalize people’s standards of living. We’ve been very consistent with that, and there are opportunities to go do that. In fact, today, at this action agenda, there is a drive for carbon accounting, that is a critical first step in establishing a more uniform approach to how we address emissions and getting from carbon accounting to carbon intensity standards. So you can start specifying that on products and letting every government around the world establish what those specs should be. It’s a very flexible approach that allows every government to tailor that to the needs of their constituency and to their specific economic conditions. That’s an approach that I think has very broad application and can be very effective.

Akshat Rathi 17:51

I’m definitely coming to carbon accounting, because that’s an interesting change since we last talked about it. But before we get there, you told me last year that you wanted the Trump administration to stay in the Paris Agreement. I understand that you’ve even delivered that message directly to the President. Why did he not listen to you?

Darren Woods 18:09

You’ll have to ask President Trump that. There are a lot of people that don’t listen to me.

Akshat Rathi 18:16

So now that the US is officially going to be out of the Paris Agreement by January, what kind of harm does that do to the US? It’s the only country that is leaving.

Darren Woods 18:26

You know, I look at the challenge here over a very long horizon, and again, our action here, the work that we do, the engagements that we have with governments all around, remains consistent. We’re going to continue trying to do that, because our view is there’s something that needs to be done in this space and that we have a role to play and can contribute. And we will work with whatever administration comes in and continue to drive an agenda that we think makes sense, that doesn’t compromise economic growth or people’s standards of living. We think there’s an option to do that and open the aperture to the solution set. You’re framing all of this as a US-Trump issue. I think you should frame it more as an opportunity to open the aperture for a broader set of solutions to achieve the real objective, which is lowering emissions, versus the objective that people have been working to, which is getting rid of oil and gas. And I think that is one of the big challenges, that we’ve gotten the objective statement wrong, or the problem statement wrong, and we’ve got to go back to how do we best reduce emissions? And the approach being taken today is essentially controlled by governments dictating what the solutions need to be, and then trying to force companies to implement their solutions. We’ve seen how controlled economies work. The Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba, East Germany — planned, centralized government control does not work. You need the markets to be engaged. There hasn’t been a solution set out there that engages the markets. That’s absolutely needed. Ideology only takes you so far, and then you need practical systems that deal with the real market constraints and the challenges of making things happen. That’s what we’ve got to get to.

Akshat Rathi 20:01

You didn’t raise the exception: China, where things are working.

Darren Woods 20:06

I would tell you that that’s a mix of things. You do need some… but government has a role, don’t get me wrong. I’m not suggesting government doesn’t have a role. But picking the solutions as a function of ideology versus a function of, say, strategy, are two very different sets of circumstances. I think the Chinese government operates a little differently than some of the democratically elected governments around the world. So it’s a different decision making process.

Akshat Rathi 20:28

So one way in which you think you can address that is through carbon accounting. Last year you talked about the idea, but today you have the initiative in front of you. It’s called carbon measures. It’s based on a concept that’s been developed by academics at Harvard University and Oxford University. The goal is to make carbon emissions work almost like financial liabilities. That once you sell the goods, you pass on the liabilities, emissions, liabilities that come with it. And you wanted that system so that you could get carbon accounting at a product level. The trouble is that the only way it’s going to work is if you have all parts of the supply chain of that product also reporting under that framework.

Darren Woods 21:15

Yeah, this is… but to be clear, this is not a reporting framework. This is not accounting in the pure sense of a financial accounting. This is an accounting analog. So there’s a financial model that we think makes a lot of sense in terms of how to think about accounting, but it’s also anchored in chemistry, and frankly, a molecule of emissions, or CO2, is created once. And so accounting for where in that value chain that emission is generated is critically important. So I don’t think of it as a financial, you know, an asset register in terms of liabilities or assets. I think of it as understanding where in a value chain for a product or a service is the emissions generated, and that’s critically important. If you want to eliminate all emissions, you damn well better be able to account for all of them.

Akshat Rathi 22:04

Conceptually what you’re saying is right, and the way the academics have put it is that once you have the concept in place, the way it will work is through reporting emissions at a product level through the supply chain, and having these liabilities be passed on from company to company as the product moves through the supply chain before it’s delivered to an end customer.

Darren Woods 22:26

Yeah, but I would keep… I mean, you refer to it as a liability being passed on, and then almost talk about it from a reporting standpoint. The opportunity here is to be able to understand what is the carbon intensity of a service or of a product. And when you have a standard that uniformly calculates that, there is an opportunity then to begin to regulate the carbon intensity of products that, in my mind, will bring in market forces. That’s the element that’s of interest to me, that I view would make carbon and carbon emissions, just like every other parameter that we control in the products that we sell, sulfur and lead and other things that we control in our products.

Akshat Rathi 23:07

Liabilities is the word that academics use. They call it…

Darren Woods 23:11

I’m not an academic, Akshat. I’m a realist. I mean, I’m the guy who’s making this stuff, and so I think that’s how we think about it.

Akshat Rathi 23:16

Yeah, I mean, they call it e-liabilities. It went nowhere, and then it got rebranded as carbon measures, and I think it’s now getting momentum. So from a conceptual perspective, I’m on your side here. What I wanted to get to, though, was that to get it to work, you need the entire supply chain to be able to agree on this framework.

Darren Woods 23:33

Yes.

Akshat Rathi 23:34

And that means it’s going to take years, decades. The greenhouse gas protocol that you don’t like, which has scope one, two and three emissions, it’s been in place for 25 years now. So there are climate advocates who are worried that climate measures is just another delay tactic. How do you address that?

Darren Woods 23:52

Well, first, I’d say you don’t have to get rid of the GHG Protocol. You can do this in addition to that. So I’m not sure… You know, I think there’s always this view that it’s an ‘either-or’ option, I keep coming back to this as an ‘and’ option. But I would also tell you the GHG Protocol, first of all, it’s not an accounting system. It’s a reporting system. And the other issue with this is, if you only use it to count, it double and triple counts, which means it doesn’t add up to the total planet’s emissions. That’s a problem. It also attempts to assign accountability where it doesn’t belong. And I make the point with scope three all the time. To ask me, as a company that produces products that are in demand and that are desperately needed by communities all around the world, that I can’t sell that to them because I need to reduce their emissions, I think is unreasonable. It’s an unreasonable request, and it ends up with an outcome that nobody wants. We’ve got 4 billion people on the planet living in energy poverty that desperately need reliable, affordable sources of energy today. Those sources have emissions associated with them. Okay, we need to address that, but we can’t do that by robbing them of the tools and the leverage enabling them to grow economically and to improve their lifestyle. And so we’ve got to figure out how we do both. I don’t know how long it takes. You know, you can start. This doesn’t have to be a big bang from my perspective. I’m a big believer in Pareto, that 20% of the products or services are causing 80% of the emissions. Let’s start by focusing on those. And by the way, you don’t get it perfect. Get 80% of the 20% and start there, and then evolve that and get better as you go. There are lots of ways to address this in a thoughtful, objective way, but we’ve got to do it in that way, thoughtfully and objectively, based on the science of CO2 emissions and generation of CO2 and then accounting philosophy for how best you do that. Get started.

Akshat Rathi 25:41

I think people who are worried about the delay tactic would welcome the view that you can have both the greenhouse gas protocol and the carbon measures accounting system, because that would allow you, in a market of ideas, competition to see which works.

Darren Woods 25:53

I don’t think anybody’s suggesting you get… Yeah, that’s exactly right. A market is a competition of ideas. And if you got a good product, if you’ve got a good idea, you shouldn’t be afraid of competition.

Akshat Rathi 26:09

Join me after the break for more of my conversation with Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil. And if you’d like more from Bloomberg Green at COP30, sign up to our newsletter for daily coverage from me and the rest of my colleagues on the ground. Sing up at bloomberg.com/newsletters.

Akshat Rathi 26:29

So let’s come to the low-carbon side of the ideas that you are funding. You have been clear in multiple forums that Exxon’s strength is in the molecules business. And that’s why you haven’t really made a play in solar or wind deployment. But what we’ve seen over the past few decades is that the demand for electricity has been typically at double the pace of energy from molecules with AI. That’s a more recent phenomenon. We are seeing the gap grow between the demand for electricity and rest of energy. Are you reconsidering getting into the electricity business as a result?

Darren Woods 27:09

I would start by reminding you that electricity is generated from molecules.

Akshat Rathi 27:11

Not always, but sometimes

Darren Woods 27:14

The majority of them. A majority of them.

Akshat Rathi 27:17

Yes

Darren Woods 27:18

And if you go well into the future to 2050, you’re still going to see the majority of power being generated by molecules. So no, I’m not reconsidering that. I think there is a capability that we bring there. And I would also strongly make the point that hydrogen and carbon molecules go into a lot more products — that society needs, that enable modern living — than just combustion products. And so I’m perfectly comfortable with the idea that over time, there will be elements of the products that I make which are no longer needed by society because we found better alternatives with less emissions, maybe other benefits. I’m okay with that. We have historically evolved as a company on that basis. That doesn’t change, though, the fundamental need for our ability to transform these molecules into products that society needs. I’ll just very quickly give you two examples. One of them is that we recognize that: one, carbon molecules are in low-demand, high supply, and so my business drives a low cost. What can we make with low-cost carbon molecules? Our organizations invented a unique carbon molecule that has properties that lend themselves to anodes and batteries. And we’re seeing, through third party testing, that our carbon that’s used in anodes gives 30% faster charging times, 30% further range and over four times the battery life. So there’s a huge improvement in lithium-ion batteries with a product that I’m making out of a molecule.

Akshat Rathi 28:41

Let’s come to that battery breakthrough, because that’s recent, the announcement at least. And batteries are something that the world wants a lot of right now, and so having new materials is good. There’s lots of innovation that’s happening in that space. But with any technology breakthrough, and this is not just a battery problem, with any technology breakthrough, there tends to be a certain amount of hype that comes with it, before we can see it in action, including with this company. We can take the example of algae fuels that Exxon was supportive of, thought there was a breakthrough, but now that doesn’t become a practical solution. So how…

Darren Woods 29:18

We should make the distinction between pursuing a technology breakthrough and announcing one. And what we talked about with biofuels was the need to produce the productivity of algae to generate the amount of oil to make it economically viable. That’s what we were working on, and we saw the potential there. We never announced a breakthrough that said we were there. I would contrast that with what we’re saying with this carbon material, which is to say we had a view and an idea. We’ve developed the molecule, we’ve graphitized it, we put it into application, and we’ve had third parties testing it, and those results are what we’re reporting on. That’s a very different construct.

Akshat Rathi 29:53

So when might we see that carbon molecule in an actual battery in a commercial product.

Darren Woods 30:00

When will we see that? We’re working really hard to get that commercialized by the end of this decade. But I think, you know, again, in my mind, we don’t over promise and under deliver, and what we’ve tried to do: is to report on what we’re trying to do and accomplish. We’ve got to commercialize that. We have gone from the lab to a demo unit, and we have to commercialize that. So that will take time. These are large scale, and by the way, we’re only going to pursue the things that are large and make a material difference to ExxonMobil. I can’t have a bunch of nickel and dime businesses. So it doesn’t bother me, and it should not suggest that, because it’s going to take time, that it’s not real. I think the difference may be in your mindset versus ours. We think in terms of decades, because we understand what it takes to make these very large scale investments, and the time that it will take to bring them online and then penetrate the markets. And that’s true with all products.

Akshat Rathi 30:47

Let’s talk about some of the other low-carbon solutions that you’ve worked on. You have a lithium-extraction idea that you are working on now, lithium prices, as you well know, are even more volatile than fossil fuel prices. Does that make the investment thesis less attractive?

Darren Woods 31:08

No, because we look at lithium no differently than we look at any other product that we make, which is, where does our production sit on the cost of supply curve? So you know, if I am dependent upon a commodity, if I’m in a commodity business where prices are set by supply and demand, I do not control the supply and I do not control the demand. So I’m a price taker. Across the majority of my businesses, I’m a price taker. And so I will never know where prices are going to be, and I know that they will fluctuate based on where demand goes and how much supply comes on. So our strategy for being successful in a volatile market is to bring production on. That’s the low cost of supply, because I know in these markets that the least efficient supplier required to meet the demand is going to set the price. I’ve got to be better than that producer to get a margin, and that’s what we’re working on. And in lithium, that’s exactly the approach that we’re taking. And I would tell you, with respect to that, we’re still working to convince ourselves that we can get on the low end of the cost of supply curve. So we’re building small units to test that, to drive the technology. Whether that will be successful, we don’t know yet, but what I’ll tell you is we know we have a concept. We’re demonstrating the ability to do that. We’ve made lithium. Now the question is, can we commercialize it at scale, at a cost that’s competitive with Chinese cash cost? That’s a question that’s yet to be answered.

Akshat Rathi 32:27

And would that be the same answer for direct air capture technology?

Darren Woods 32:32

Direct air capture the same thing, everything that we’re doing, it’s a little different in that it’s a cost of abatement, but it’s the same principle, we have to be on the low end of the cost of abatement curve, because if it can’t compete economically, then we’re not interested. And I would tell you that’s true, even for the businesses today that are being subsidized by policy. What I tell the organization is we can begin the business based on that, but we’re not going to end up there. And so anything that we’re doing, we have to convince ourselves that over time, we’ll find a way to get on the far left hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that when market forces take over, and by the way, they have to, if we’re going to be successful as a society, that I better be advantaged with respect to that production. And if I can’t clear that hurdle and convince myself of it, we won’t go in on that business or make those investments.

Akshat Rathi 33:18

Another low-carbon commitment you have is to reduce the methane intensity of natural gas so the amount of methane that you leak as a result of the processes that are involved in extracting and delivering natural gas to customers. You have a goal for 2030 to try and be near-zero methane leaks, and that’s crucial here at COP30, where there’s going to be a big discussion around methane, and maybe even a methane deal of some sort. There’s already a target, but how do you actually get to that target? Lots of countries are talking about that. Now, the Inflation Reduction Act would have benefited companies like yours who are starting to work on reducing methane intensity, because it was going to put a methane fee on those who leak a lot. That’s gone now. Do you stop investing in methane reductions as a result of the incentive going away?

Darren Woods 34:11

We were driving methane intensity reductions before the IRA came along, and we’ll continue to do it long after the IRA has expired. So our commitment to reduce emissions, CO2 emissions, methane emissions, isn’t a function of policy being put in place or being incentivized by penalties. Our objective is to be a responsible operator. And from my perspective, from the day I got in this job, it was, if we’re producing something, it’s our responsibility and obligation to keep it in the pipe, and we need to work to do that. And we’ve made huge progress in that, irrespective of the commitments that we’ve made publicly. That was, if you go back in time before methane had the profile that it has today, we began reducing our methane emissions intensity before even this became a very public issue or a high-profile issue, and we’re going to continue to do that. We made great progress with it.

Akshat Rathi 35:01

One of the things that has happened over the last few years, which has been exceptional relative to other oil and gas companies, is that Exxon has signed lots and lots of permitting deals around the world. So recently Greece, but also you’re re-entering Iraq, Trinidad, Libya. Given where we are in oil and gas markets generally, there’s lots of oversupply right now. Prices have been falling. Why are you expanding your permitting regime so aggressively?

Darren Woods 35:32

This is a depletion business. The bigger you are, the more production you have, the bigger the hole you dig through depletion. So every barrel we produce is a barrel that’s not available to us. So you can think of it like having a bottle of water. Every sip you take, there’s less water in the bottle. Eventually the bottle runs out of water, and you need to find a new bottle. So that’s the job that we have. As we continue to produce as a large producer, we have to find ways to replace the barrels that we’ve put on the marketplace. That’s a huge challenge. And given that if you go out to 2050, and beyond, that oil and gas will continue to play an important role in the energy mix and in providing products that the world needs, we know those barrels are going to be needed. And so finding opportunities to bring more production on, to fill the depletion curve, is a critical part of the job. There’s only really three levers that we have to pull there. One is for the resources that we already have today. How do we recover more? That’s a technology challenge that we’re working very hard on. The other is, you can go out and bring a technology advantage or a production advantage or operating advantage to buy somebody else’s assets and produce those more effectively, get better recovery, do it at a lower cost. And then the third is you’ve got to find new things, and explorations are a critical part of that.

Akshat Rathi 36:49

In getting those permits, how much has the Trump administration been helpful?

Darren Woods 36:54

We don’t work through the US government on those.

Akshat Rathi 36:58

Would you be interested in oil and gas assets in Venezuela if they were to open up?

Darren Woods 37:01

So, you know, we’ve been expropriated from Venezuela two different times. And so I think we have our history there. We have an experience set. And so certainly looking at what follows and what’s in place, and how comfortable and confident are we that if we made investments, that we’d see the return on those investments? It would be a critical part to evaluating that, and then we’d have to see what the economics look like. So I wouldn’t put it on the list or take it off the list. We’d have to see what the circumstances are at the time, which today, I don’t know what they’re going to be, if they’re even different.

Akshat Rathi 37:31

You said previously that you don’t work with the Trump administration on permitting deals abroad, but there is a clear indication from the Trump administration that they would like more oil and gas production globally. Has there been any support to help you figure out where that might be?

Darren Woods 37:45

We don’t need any help in that area.

Akshat Rathi 37:48

Now, key to your efforts to turn around performance at ExxonMobil, a 150 year old company, has been what you’ve classed as your focus on winning. Some of that, though, has included layoffs and cost cutting internally. It’s also included suing activist shareholders and even taking a rival to arbitration court. Can you define what winning means to you?

Darren Woods 38:11

Yeah, you’ve mixed a lot of things up in that. That question that, frankly, don’t… are you’ve got apples, oranges, bananas and pears in there. I think first of all, what I would tell you is, what we’ve been very focused on winning is bringing a unique set of capabilities and competitive advantages to the marketplace and realizing those advantages on the bottom line. And so if you look at the transformation the company’s been making, the changes that we’ve made in our organization, it has been restructuring to more effectively bring the advantages of scale, bring the advantages of the integrated businesses that we have, and the synergies that exist between those businesses to the bottom line. Taking advantage of and driving technology and technology benefits to the bottom line. It’s a focus on execution excellence, to drive capital efficiency, to drive reliability, to drive lower maintenance, higher safety, better environmental performance. And then it’s been about unlocking the potential of our people. That’s what the changes that we’ve been driving to unlock this advantage we’ve been very focused on. We’ve made great progress. And the layoffs that came from that is a function of the restructuring and better organizing our people in a way that they can work more productively and take advantage of everything ExxonMobil has to offer. It was more about effectiveness, less about efficiency. But like everything, when you focus on being more effective, you find efficiencies. And so that’s what’s driving that. With respect to the lawsuits, this is really around protecting the value that we’re creating for our shareholders and importantly, defending ourselves against activist attacks, which are generated by an agenda that’s not aligned with the value of the company or the value that we create for our shareholders. And unfortunately, we’ve gotten to a place in society where the courts are being used frequently to bring challenges to some of these activities, and we’re going to use the same tools that our antagonists use to defend the value that we’re creating for our shareholders.

Akshat Rathi 40:06

Sticking to layoffs, Exxon currently has 14,000 fewer employees than in 2019, and there are plans to lose another 2000 jobs. And Exxon isn’t the only company doing this. We’ve seen jobs in Conoco Phillips being cut 20-25%. Chevron has said it would cut about 20% of its workforce. Do you think it’s a sign of the industry shrinking, that its social license is eroding?

Darren Woods 40:32

I can’t speak for Conoco and Chevron. I can speak for ourselves, and it’s not… If you look at the layoffs that you’re talking about, for us, it’s like 3% of the workforce, global workforce. So again, we’ve been very focused on changing how we work, as I mentioned, the transformation that we’re trying to make, to unlock our competitive advantages. What we’ve shifted to as we’ve changed the how, is to focus on the where. And if you look at our global footprint and where we were located, it is based on an operating model, a construct that was developed decades ago. And so we’re bringing our operational footprint, our facility footprint, in line with how we work today. That is, with my mind, an optimization step. It is not a deep cut to drive. And again, it wasn’t driven, wasn’t focused, on cost cutting. It was focused on taking advantage of our people and the teamwork and the collaboration and the innovation that comes from that, that we have unlocked with these changes, and we can only do that when people are in the same location. I’m a big believer in working together, not working remotely.

Akshat Rathi 41:34

Well, the 2000 are, yes, 3%. But since 2019, it’s more than 25%, because you have 63,000 employees now.

Darren Woods 41:42

Which comes from the transformation in the organization. We had, I think, 11 independent, unique companies, siloed in our organization. We’ve gotten rid of the silos today and reorganized. We have a one team-one goal mentality. People are working collaboratively together, and so you just need less people when you take away the artificial construct that exists. That’s a function of improving your effectiveness, getting better at what we do, and you see that in the results that we have. If this was a pure cost-cutting exercise, you wouldn’t see the improvement that we’re getting in safety — personnel safety and process safety. You wouldn’t see the improvement that we’re getting in our reliability. And we now have record reliability with our operations. You wouldn’t see that in the projects that we’re delivering, which today are industry leading, both in cost and schedule. And so there’s a lot of benefits that you can see that’s happening in the company because of this effectiveness thing.

Akshat Rathi 42:33

If we take that five year period, the stock price has certainly done wonders for Exxon. But if you just take the last 12 months since Donald Trump’s election, since all these regulatory rollbacks, since the push to try and get more fossil fuels, the stock price hasn’t done all that well. It’s a little bit lower now than it was exactly one year ago.

Darren Woods 42:54

Very much, you have to… I think anytime you look at the stock price of the company, you have to look at the commodity price market that we’re in. Our stock price is highly correlated with commodity prices, and so it will move up and down. So the absolute number is less important than the relative number over time, and the things that you’re doing to improve that. So I don’t have any concerns in that space.

Akshat Rathi 43:13

You’ve been in the role for nine years. How long do you plan to stay on?

Darren Woods 43:17

Well, the board gets to decide that, not me.

Akshat Rathi 43:22

And what would you like to get done before you step away?

Darren Woods 43:24

We’ve made a lot of changes, as you’ve talked about, many of those have been recent. In fact, we just announced this week the formation of a global operations organization, and we’ve got to bed those in. And I think we’re only beginning to see the benefits of that change. And I would like to have time to really focus the organization on improving the effectiveness of the changes that we’ve made. We are rolling out, I think, the largest instance of SAP where today, under our corporation, for the first time in our history, we will have a system that spans the entire corporation and a data structure that’s consistent for every business we do everywhere around the world. So it unlocks huge opportunities. Think about that in conjunction with AI, where data and data consistency and integrity is so critical to the benefits of AI. We will have an unmatched platform with more data than anybody else in our industry. And so I think I’d like to see that through. We’ve got a program where we’re developing that through the next several years. So there’s still a lot to be done in the company that’s going to keep me busy, and I’d like to see some of that land and begin to produce the results that we’re counting on.

Goldman projects that by 2030, the country's effective spare power capacity will reach around 400 gigawatts — more than three times the world's total expected data center power demand.
""We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,"" Goldman's analysts wrote.
Other issues that could limit data center growth in the US include lengthy project timelines and a global shortage of gas-powered turbines.
By contrast, he said China's government energy subsidies make it cheaper for local tech firms to power homegrown AI chips, as ""power is free.""","The US is racing ahead in artificial intelligence, but its biggest obstacle is more than chips, rare earths, or talent — it's electricity, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs.

The US power grid is already straining under the surge of data centers fueling AI models, with these massive facilities now accounting for about 6% of total US electricity demand.

That share is expected to nearly double to 11% by 2030, pushing parts of the country's grid past critical limits, Goldman's analysts estimate.

""As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,"" wrote Goldman's analysts.

The issue could slow the US's pace in the AI tech race, where it is a frontrunner.

The US leads the world in AI infrastructure, with 44% of global data center capacity — about as much as China, the EU, Japan, Korea, and India put together.

However, the US power market has been tightening, with US peak summer spare power generation capacity decreasing from 26% five years ago to 19% as demand from data centers rose.

By the end of the decade, this spare capacity could fall below the ""critically tight"" 15% level if AI growth continues at its current pace, Goldman's analysts estimate.

China powers ahead

While the US grid tightens, China has been quietly stockpiling energy.

Goldman projects that by 2030, the country's effective spare power capacity will reach around 400 gigawatts — more than three times the world's total expected data center power demand.

""We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,"" Goldman's analysts wrote.

China's buildup follows an energy crunch in 2021 that led Beijing to ramp up power generation across renewables, natural gas, nuclear, and coal to ensure energy security.

The US, by contrast, is retiring coal plants faster than it's adding new natural gas or renewable capacity. Other issues that could limit data center growth in the US include lengthy project timelines and a global shortage of gas-powered turbines.

""Reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race,"" the analysts wrote, ""especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve.""

Goldman's report came amid an intensifying race for artificial intelligence between the US and China.

Earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also mentioned energy as an issue that could hinder the US's AI development.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Huang noted a growing wave of AI regulations emerging across US states and warned that too many new rules could stifle innovation.

By contrast, he said China's government energy subsidies make it cheaper for local tech firms to power homegrown AI chips, as ""power is free.""",https://i.insider.com/6916ae6ee1a9cbb014de3327?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 08:58:27.655661

It would come from Clark.” A Photo Gallery: Life the D’Arcy Lab All photos in the lab by Steven King, University Photographer","Chemistry Professor Julio D’Arcy leads a student research team seeking to develop state-of-the-art technology aimed at improving human lives

A house constructed from red “smart bricks” charged to provide electricity. A hospital operating room built with self-cleaning tiles that kill superbugs. Semiconductor nanoparticles to improve MRIs or generate clean water. Micro-batteries embedded in clothing to monitor your health.

These are a few of the applications that could emerge from the foundational research occurring in the lab of Professor Julio D’Arcy, the Carl J. and Anna Carlson Endowed Chair of Chemistry and Biochemistry.

His research could be used to lower costs for energy storage in devices or enable development of lightweight batteries for transportation applications.

“Everyone’s probably heard stories about how everything ‘nano’ is better,” he says. “Physics change at that smaller scale, and things behave better. Ion transport is facilitated at this scale, enabling rapid charging.”

Many days, D’Arcy’s lab is abuzz with the activities of 17 undergraduate and graduate students who work with iron oxide, or rust, which makes bricks red. They develop and study synthetic polymers — complex, chemically bonded chains of large molecules — used to produce materials for energy storage devices, atmospheric water harvesting, pH and temperature sensors, and other applications, including those in medicine.

“We’re always after the same goal,” D’Arcy says. “We want to make a polymer that conducts electricity. The more it conducts, the better.”

From the lab to publication to industrial applications

After his brick research was published by Nature Communications in 2020, D’Arcy heard from hundreds of private companies, global investors, and journalists interested in his work. As he told Scientific American, “We’re trying to make specialized plastics that are only used on the nanoscale — where we use very little of the plastic, and we can actually embed that plastic inside construction materials.”

His research team didn’t expect such worldwide attention. “We got a little taste of what can happen if you publish in a field where people care about the intersection of this research,” recalls D’Arcy, who joined Clark’s Gustav H. Carlson School of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 2022. “They’re all after the same idea: adding sustainability into construction materials. It’s not just the architecture they’re interested in. It’s the idea that construction materials are going to make you live longer, or the idea that you’re going to be able to store energy in bricks, steel, or concrete.”

D’Arcy’s synthesis of organic semiconductor nanoparticles would fill a commercial and societal need. “It’s something that manufacturers want,” he says. “We propose a method that produces nanoparticles very fast, using aerosols. It’s hard to do, but it’s doable.”

Meanwhile, his research on developing smooth polymers to create antibacterial coatings also holds much promise.

“You could use this masonry material in operating rooms or kitchens,” D’Arcy says, “anyplace where you have people with compromised immune systems or where you prepare food.”

To form nanoparticles of a polymer called PEDOT — short for Poly(3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene) — D’Arcy’s students design and build glass-and-metal, box-shaped reactors in which they place 1-centimeter-square brick samples. They fill the reactors with ferric chloride, an acid in water.

“We’re heating the sample and exposing it to vapors or reactants,” D’Arcy explains. “The monomer, or simple molecule, gets polymerized on the surface of the brick once it’s been activated by the acid.”

The shape of the polymer determines its application. “We make nanotubes, nanofibers, and smooth films,” he says.

Applying art history to polymer research

Besides contributing to foundational research that could result in wide-ranging applications, students in D’Arcy’s lab are gaining hands-on, career-ready experience and preparing to publish journal articles.

They include two undergraduate students, Avery Schwartz ’26 and Ella Traynor ’26, who have studied chemical reactions that produce polymers and their semiconductor nanoparticles.

A double major in chemistry and art history, Schwartz has worked in the lab for more than a year, funded last summer by a Weiller Research Fellowship. She has presented twice at ClarkFEST, the biannual undergraduate research and scholarship event.

Schwartz’s research examines the chemical reaction that occurs when nanotube structures — which can attract, absorb, and hold atmospheric water — are formed during the “vapor phase” of polymerization. She studies nanotube “films” of polypyrrole, a type of polymer that has applications for energy storage, water purification, and water storage.

Although Schwartz investigated the formation of polymer films on glass, “you can apply the polymer film to any substrate, like a brick, and collect even more water,” she says, benefiting areas of the world that need clean drinking water.

In the lab, Schwartz’s two academic majors “play off of each other in an interesting way,” she says. “Art history is a lot about noticing things and taking the time to craft and engineer an argument about whatever work you’re talking about or evidence you’re seeing in the history. And I think that’s what makes for a successful chemist as well — deeply analyzing a lot of the work that you’re doing and the observations you’re making.”

‘You must be decisive, and you must have a plan’

Funded over two summers — a Murdock Research Fellowship in 2025 and a Penn Family Research Fellowship in 2024 — Traynor has worked in D’Arcy’s lab for nearly three years, “doing a little bit of everything.” Traynor’s main focus, however, is studying how and why the introduction of a power source during the vapor phase synthesis of PEDOT results in a chemical reaction that forms a germ-killing peroxide.

The research could be applied to developing self-sterilizing brick tiles for hospital operating rooms.

“There’s the water-splitting reaction caused by the battery and our polymer, and then there’s the iron oxide in the bricks, which results in a chemical, or Fenton, reaction,” they explain, “and that’s what results in those peroxide radicals that are so good at killing organisms like bacteria.”

A chemistry major who also enjoys and hopes to minor in physics, Traynor now is mentoring another undergraduate student, Beckham Ward ’28, who just joined D’Arcy’s lab. “I was showing him how to do stuff with my project. That was cool — it’s like my research has come full circle.”

A catcher and infielder for women’s softball, Traynor made the 2025 Softball Academic All-Conference Team last spring. They plan to continue their research next year as part of Clark’s 4+1 Accelerated Master’s Degree in chemistry.

Juggling academics, softball practices, and games as a student-athlete has forced them to “stay organized. It’s given me a lot of time-management skills,” says Traynor, who also applies their coach’s advice to apply a “growth mindset” to build her softball skills. “It makes me a little more focused on moving forward or what I need to do next.”

Playing catcher behind home plate also has provided Traynor with additional skills they can apply to chemistry research.

“You’re thinking through plays. You’re the only one who sees the whole field,” Traynor says. “People are listening to you because you’re the only one who has eyes on all the runners and all the fielders. I think that helps you be a little more assertive. You must be a quick thinker, you must be decisive, and you must have a plan. And I think that applies to real life and the lab as well.”

Carbon fiber paper for smart wearables

Both Schwartz and Traynor have benefited from mentoring by graduate students in the lab, including current master’s student Yiming Qin and Ph.D. students Umama Akther and Ye Chen.

Qin’s research and master’s thesis focus on micro-supercapacitors, the conducting polymers that can serve as tiny batteries to store energy.

“I’m working with carbon fiber paper,” he says. “Carbon fiber paper is a substrate, and we grow our conducting polymer PEDOT nanofibers on it.”

Although carbon fiber is fragile, it can become stronger when woven together to cover a larger area, according to Qin.

“It could be used like a wearable, like energy storage devices in smart clothes, smart shoes, or smart watches,” he says.

Qin is working with D’Arcy to publish his research, then hopes to return to China to work in industry and care for his parents.

When Akther was applying to chemistry Ph.D. programs in the United States, her mentors and peers from Bangladesh urged her to apply to Clark, she says.

As an undergraduate student in chemistry at Jashore University of Science and Technology, Akther had had worked in a research lab on a project to improve food safety. She studied the computational chemistry behind using simple salt or vinegar solutions to remove heavy metals from vegetables grown in Jashore for sales and export. The research resulted in a recent article published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis.

Akther wanted a similarly robust research experience in a Ph.D. program. When D’Arcy offered her a position in his lab, her supervisor in Bangladesh suggested she take it.

“She said, ‘This project is really, really good. This is a promising field for industry and jobs, and you can work in the field — polymer chemistry, nano chemistry, and also engineering,’ ” Akther recalls.

‘This is the research that companies are interested in’

Now Akther is in her second year at Clark, leading her own research project and mentoring undergraduate students in D’Arcy’s lab. With assistance from undergraduate students Katelynn Humphrey ’25 last year and Emme Salisbury ’28 and Emma St. Louis ’28 this year, Akther has sought to develop and build a reactor that uses aerosol vapor polymerization. The goal, she says, is to more rapidly — and easily — produce smaller organic semiconductor nanoparticles of PEDOT, shaped like spheres for easier delivery.

Her research has potential biomedical applications. “If we make this particle at the nanometer-size scale,” she says, “then it can be inserted into our bodies because it’s safe — it has no side effects. It can be used in MRI imaging.”

Yet, the work can be slow and tedious at times. “Over a year, I have tried eight to nine times to change my reactor. I need a more advanced reactor so it can handle more nanoparticles,” she says.

Akther uses imaging software to examine the microscopic nanoparticles. “If I’m getting 9-micrometer particles, but my goal is 5 micrometers,” she explains, “then I think, ‘OK, what can I change to make my particle smaller? Also, how many am I making? Are the particles attached to each other? What is the problem within my reactor?’ ”

She is overseeing another undergraduate student, Tatsuya Peralta ’27, a chemistry major who is helping her build more powerful nebulizers to produce aerosolized droplets of ferric chloride, which are carried into her reactors. They will replace the store-bought household humidifier she has been using.

“I can produce a hundred particles in one run now,” she explains. “But if my humidifier is more powerful, then I can make 200 or 300.”

In the field, research exploring aerosol polymerization has not been widely explored, Akther says, “so we would like to introduce this process to others.”

Even more, D’Arcy says, if he and his research team make inroads in their polymer studies, “we expect this to have a significant societal impact.

“I am doing the research that I am interested in, but this is the research that companies are interested in as well,” he says. “And if it’s successful, it would come from us. It would come from Clark.”

Once operational, each site is expected to generate around 100 GWh of LBG annually.

The combined output will play a significant role in Havila Biogass’s strategy to expand zero-emission energy solutions through circular resource use, supporting the decarbonisation of Norway’s heavy industry and transport sectors.

Kjell Evensgård, CEO of Havila Biogass, said the company selected Nordsol not only for its “proven, reliable and cost-efficient technology”, but also for its expertise and project approach.

“Together, we are accelerating the scale-up of sustainable energy systems and taking another major step toward a circular, carbon-negative energy future,” he said.

Alongside the three new plants, the companies have signed a Partnership Agreement to jointly develop more than 400 GWh of additional LBG capacity in the coming years.

The expansion would lift total output above 700 GWh and more than double Norway’s current biomethane supply.

Nordsol CEO Léon van Bossum said Havila Biogass was acting with the “decisiveness that our time demands”.

He added: “Their ambition perfectly matches Nordsol’s drive to turn waste into value. Bio-LNG offers a real opportunity to decarbonise today, and we’re proud to seize that opportunity together.”",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Havila-Nordsol-press-release-768x576.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:01:55.346963

Amrize, the nation’s largest cement producer, is making a $700-million investment in its U.S. facilities and betting a new “Made in America” label can do more than stir patriotic appeal.

Launching Nov. 13 at flagship plants from Missouri to Texas, the company says the certification ensures domestic manufacturing and expands U.S. capacity. An ancillary benefit of domestically sourced materials is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in one of construction’s most emission-intensive materials.

“Our new ‘Made in America’ label offers our customers the confidence that their product complies with U.S. standards for quality, performance and reliability, with local-to-local service,” Jaime Hill, president of Amrize Building Materials, said in a statement.

“We are proud of the role our solutions play in building America and are committed to advancing the U.S. building industry, supporting American jobs and serving as the partner of choice for the professional builders of America,” he added.

Amrize plans to extend the label across five of its U.S. plants, starting with facilities in Ste. Genevieve, Mo.; Midlothian, Texas; Devil’s Slide, Utah; Holly Hill, S.C.; and Portland, Colo.

The rollout coincides with upgrades that add approximately 760,000 tons of annual production, including a 660,000-ton expansion at Ste. Genevieve—North America’s largest cement plant—and $50 million in modernization work at Midlothian.

Patrick Cleary, Amrize’s senior vice president for U.S. commercial cement, said the Made in America label is meant to instill confidence and support economic growth. “We see a clear opportunity to strengthen partnerships that value verified domestic content,” he said.

The U.S. cement and concrete sector contributes more than $130 billion annually to the economy and supports about 600,000 jobs, according to the American Cement Association. National shipments reached roughly 105 million metric tons in 2024, with imports supplying about 23% of total demand—valued at nearly $16 billion.

Although the new label echoes “Buy America” sentiment, cement itself remains outside Federal Highway Administration domestic-content mandates.

FHWA rules that took effect Oct. 1 begin phasing in U.S. manufacturing and component thresholds for manufactured products under federally funded projects, but cement is not yet covered.

“For the five flagship plants where we’re launching the label, we’ve verified the origin of all raw materials through a full supply review,” the company said in an email.

""We see a clear opportunity to strengthen our partnerships that value verified domestic content with customers seeking to specify and promote Made in America solutions,"" Patrick Cleary, Amrize senior vice president of Commercial Cement for the U.S., said in an email to ENR.

""Success will be measured not only in market performance, but also by our customers’ trust,"" he added.

An additional advantage of using domestically sourced materials is reducing ecological impact. Local procurement, by definition, will lower the amount of energy needed to obtain raw materials compared to non-domestic sources. The result is a reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions.

Several states, including California and Colorado, have adopted Buy Clean standards that factor carbon emissions into material procurement. That convergence between sourcing policy and emissions disclosure could give Amrize’s label additional traction.

New White House Buy America Guidance Draws Scrutiny

Material Sourcing and Carbon Footprint

Amrize’s “local-to-local” logistics model reduces delivery distances, a growing factor in embodied-carbon accounting. That connection between local production and emissions drew cautious endorsement from Kari Yuers, chair of the American Concrete Institute’s Chemical Admixtures Committee and president of Kryton International.

“If you lower transportation distances, you naturally lower embodied carbon,” Yuers told ENR. “But it’s only one piece of the puzzle. We need parallel moves—electrification of transport, alternative-fuel kilns, 1L cements, carbon-capture pilots—to actually move the needle.”

She added that verification matters as much as intent. “Labels are valuable if they’re verifiable,” she said. “Without transparent data on embodied-carbon intensity, a domestic-content label risks becoming just another marketing claim.”

Producing cement clinker by heating limestone and clay in kilns is the most energy-intensive aspect of creating Portland cement. Clinker is the key product where the chemical reaction takes place and is responsible for the majority of the environmental emissions associated with producing cement, which is eventually used in concrete.

Contractors and state transportation agencies can verify domestic-content claims and environmental disclosures through Federal Trade Commission labeling rules and ASTM-compliant Environmental Product Declarations.

Such documentation is increasingly required in material procurement scoring and Buy Clean reporting frameworks from federal authorities, ACI and other standards-making bodies.

Decarbonization and Industry Outlook

The company’s investment push includes process efficiency upgrades, as well as breaking ground this year on a new fly-ash beneficiation plant in Virginia, aiming to reclaim landfilled ash as a supplementary cementitious material—a key step in offsetting clinker emissions.

Many U.S. concrete producers currently import fly ash from overseas due to the lack of coal-fired power plants in the U.S., making procurement from Europe or coal-friendly nations necessary. That supply chain was disrupted not only during the pandemic but also during more recent shortages of the coal byproduct due to heavy demand for mission-critical facilities.

“Beneficiated fly ash and calcined clay can make a real dent in carbon, but access and permitting are limiting factors,” Yuers said. “We need regional supply solutions so contractors aren’t waiting months for alternative materials.”

Yuers added that Portland-limestone cement, known in industry standards as Type 1L, can lower CO2 intensity by 10–15% without compromising structural performance when mix designs are properly adjusted. “They’re the fastest near-term win,” she said. “They’re proven and ready if the market demands them.”

Cement manufacturing accounts for roughly 71 million metric tons of CO2 a year—about 4.4% of U.S. industrial greenhouse-gas output, according to EPA and Clean Air Task Force data.

With construction activity expected to rise through 2030, producers are facing increasing pressure from owners and transportation departments to document life-cycle carbon reductions through Environmental Product Declarations.

“Domestic production and low-carbon production don’t have to be separate goals,” Yuers said. “If companies like Amrize align both, they’ll redefine what ‘Made in America’ means for the next generation of infrastructure.”

For Amrize, the label positions the company where domestic sourcing and carbon reduction goals converge.

""The label reinforces Amrize’s role as the local partner helping states, builders, and contractors source materials produced in their own communities,"" the company said. ""It provides a clear signal to customers and public agencies that working with a labeled Amrize cement product directly supports American manufacturing, American jobs and local economic growth.""

Whether the initiative becomes a verified competitive standard—or simply savvy branding—will depend on data the industry has only begun to measure.

The City of Austin is preparing for a bond election in 2026 to pay for infrastructure projects.

(Note: This is an entirely separate effort from the recent Prop Q tax rate election, which was about paying for the city’s operating costs.)

The City Council-appointed Bond Election Advisory Task Force (BEATF) has met for a year and is deep in the process of evaluating requests for funding from various city departments. The BEATF is seeking public input as part of this process. In addition to inviting public comments, the task force is hosting three public input sessions over the next couple of weeks.

Here is the listening session schedule:

WHEN: November 15, 6-8 p.m.

WHERE: Gustavo “Gus” L. Garcia Recreation Center (1201 E Rundberg Ln)

RSVP Here

WHEN: November 18, 6-8 p.m.

This bond process was preceded by an effort to initiate an Environmental Investment Plan, which would have provided funding for climate and environmental projects. The Austin City Council ultimately expanded the scope to include an evaluation of all bond needs for the city, but retained climate change as a key factor to be addressed by the bond package. However, the list of projects proposed by city staff has mostly been routine projects – not climate or environmentally focused specifically.

The task force will have to decide how much to prioritize climate action and sustainability in the projects we recommend to Council. Will this bond be an opportunity for the city to catch up on its climate goals, or will it be standard infrastructure projects delivered in the standard fashion? Construction generally increases greenhouse gas emissions, but there are some projects – building electric vehicle charging infrastructure, preserving land for carbon sequestration, and expanding sidewalks and bike lanes – that can help meet climate goals. Projects like libraries and health centers can be designed to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions over time by using low-carbon building materials and including on-site solar installations.

Whatever it is you want to see in the bond package, we encourage you to show up and speak up. Your feedback and input will help direct the work of the task force.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 08:58:55.338921

Project lead engineer and celebrity Slater Young said in a YouTube video that The Rise at Monterrazas, which began construction in 2024, was designed to be sustainable with an irrigation system similar to those used in agriculture to collect and store rainwater.

However, a video uploaded by a netizen during the typhoon showed floodwaters rushing down from the mountainside development. “Grabe ang baha galing sa Monterrazas, nasira ang kanilang dam. Kaya delikado magka landslide dito,” the uploader said.

(TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF), in an interview with Tracy Hughes, host of InvestorNews.com. “That’s important for the relationship with Vacuumschmelze.”

At a time when global supply chains are being reshaped by Chinese export bans, Ucore has positioned itself as a linchpin in the West’s pursuit of rare earth independence. The recently signed Memorandum of Understanding with Germany’s Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co. KG (VAC) and eVAC Magnetics LLC represents, according to Ryan, “an alliance between Canada, the US, and Germany – three countries connecting.” The partnership, timed to coincide with the G7 summit, links Ucore’s rare earth refining technology with one of the world’s most established magnet manufacturers, which supplies critical materials for defense systems, electric vehicles, and renewable energy applications.

VAC’s US subsidiary, eVAC Magnetics, has just completed construction of a permanent magnet facility in Sumter County, South Carolina, supported by the US Department of Defense and a $111.9 million advanced energy project tax credit program. Ucore’s task is to supply these facilities with high-purity rare earth oxides – materials separated using the proprietary RapidSX™ technology, which, according to Ryan, “is 70% faster than solvent extraction and requires 60% less space.” Thanks to the system’s flexibility, Ucore can adjust its production targets within hours instead of weeks. “If you’re targeting something specific like samarium or gadolinium, you can actually do that economically,” he said. “You can pursue that specific group of at-risk rare earth minerals and make them available to someone like Vacuumschmelze.”

For Ryan, it’s not about incremental progress, but about strategic autonomy. “We are funded by the Department of Defense, and so are they – so that’s a good connection,” he explained. “It’s about rebuilding the Western supply network.”

This network is also supported by Canada. Following China’s April export restrictions on rare earths like samarium and gadolinium – elements essential for high-temperature magnets in F-35 fighter jets and Virginia-class submarines – the Canadian federal government announced CAD 36.3 million in funding for Ucore. “This culminated in a program announced at the G7 summit,” Ryan said. “Minister Hodgson signed the agreement with Ucore right on stage.” The funds – CAD 26 million from Natural Resources Canada and CAD 10 million from FedDev Ontario – will support a samarium-gadolinium production line in Canada. “It’s a full grant, not a loan,” Ryan emphasized. “So, yes, we are very pleased with that.”

While Washington and Ottawa divide responsibilities – Louisiana focusing on heavy rare earths, Canada on samarium-gadolinium – Ucore is also solidifying its upstream alliances. The company has once again partnered with Hastings Technology Metals Ltd. (ASX: HAS), an Australian rare earth producer now free from previous entanglements with China. “The collaboration between Hastings and Ucore brings Canadian technology and US manufacturing together in Louisiana,” Ryan said. “We are working quickly to be ready by 2027.”

Ryan’s tone is calm, but unmistakably strategic. “To build a supply chain, you need interconnected nodes,” he said. “You can’t just sign one-off MOUs that don’t offer a complete solution.” With advancing facilities in Alexandria, Louisiana, and Kingston, Ontario, as well as downstream partners like VAC and eVAC, Ryan sees Ucore’s role as more than just a participant. “If ‘command center’ means delivering products and addressing supply chain deficiencies to rebuild the Western supply network,” he said, “then we gladly accept that title.”

The statement hangs in the air – a reminder that the race for rare earths is no longer about who can dig the deepest, but who can connect the dots the fastest.

First promulgated in 2023, the PFAS Reporting Rule in its current form is wide-sweeping, applying to all companies that domestically manufactured PFAS or imported PFAS-containing items during 2011-2022. The current rule includes essentially no exemptions, and now EPA is proposing to change that.

EPA’s proposal would incorporate exemptions for imported articles; de minimis concentrations of PFAS at 0.1% or lower; byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates; and for research and development (R&D). EPA is also proposing certain clarifications, technical corrections, and to key the submission period to the effective date of the finalized revisions. The most prominent of these proposed revisions is the imported articles exemption, which would remove from the rule’s scope the large majority of companies subject to the regulation in its current form. Affected stakeholders should consider submitting public comments on the proposed revisions, and these comments will be due 45 days after the proposed revisions are published in the Federal Register.

Background

EPA first finalized the PFAS Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. Part 705) in October 2023 pursuant to Section 8(a)(7) of TSCA, which was added to TSCA by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Section 8(a)(7) requires EPA to promulgate a reporting rule applicable to “each person who has manufactured a chemical substance that is a [PFAS] in any year since January 1, 2011.” EPA applied Section 8(a)(7) through the October 2023 rule to impose a one-time reporting requirement on all companies that manufactured PFAS between 2011 and 2022 or that imported PFAS in any amount during that period (even in articles). EPA has since delayed the submission period for this rule twice, and that submission period is currently set to open on April 13, 2026, and close (for most manufacturers) on October 13, 2026.

As explained in our previous alert, EPA’s proposed revisions to this rule are not completely unexpected. EPA under the Trump administration has previously indicated that revisions were on the horizon, including through an April 28, 2025 press release where EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin committed the agency to implementing TSCA section 8(a)(7) “to smartly collect necessary information, as Congress envisioned and consistent with TSCA, without overburdening small businesses and article importers.”

The Proposed Exemptions

EPA is proposing to add exemptions to the rule for the following:

Imported articles. “Article” is defined in the rule at 40 C.F.R. § 705.3 and can generally be described as a finished good or component thereof with a definitive shape or design. EPA justified this exemption in the preamble by explaining that article importers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information about the PFAS in the articles they imported during the lookback period. EPA also reasoned that Congress did not intend Section 8(a)(7) to apply to article importers and that the agency will nevertheless receive information on PFAS in articles by upstream PFAS manufacturers who will still be required to report under the rule.

De minimis PFAS concentrations. EPA explained in the preamble that the agency is “proposing a de minimis concentration exemption for reportable PFAS in mixtures or articles under which PFAS concentrations below 0.1% would be exempt from reporting.” EPA reasoned in the preamble that this exemption is justified in part because, during the lookback period, “reporters are unlikely to have records of PFAS amounts below 0.1% due to U.S. and international requirements at the time.” EPA also noted that the agency is interested in comments on whether a 1.0% de minimis exemption or another de minimis level would be more appropriate.

Byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates. EPA explained in the preamble that these exemptions would “align with existing exemptions under TSCA for substances not manufactured and used for a separate commercial purpose and is consistent with the approach taken in EPA’s [Chemical Data Reporting] rule.”

R&D chemicals. This exemption would apply to PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes. EPA explained in the preamble that this exemption is justified since “information on PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes would be limited and would provide minimal information regarding PFAS exposures and quantities in commerce.”

EPA also offered other justifications for the revisions in the preamble, including how TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A)-(C) directs EPA, to the extent feasible, to not require unnecessary or duplicative reporting, minimize compliance costs on small manufacturers, and apply reporting obligations only to companies likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of TSCA. EPA likewise pointed to TSCA Section 2(c), which directs EPA to carry out TSCA “in a reasonable and prudent manner” and to “consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action.”

Proposed Revision to the Submission Period, Clarifications and Technical Corrections

EPA is proposing that the submission period begin 60 days after the effective date of the finalized revisions and then last for three months. As EPA explained in the preamble, this revision to the submission period will “allow[] reporters to familiarize themselves with the amended rule and ensure their data are responsive to the amended rule and EPA to modify the reporting application as needed.”

EPA is also proposing a few clarifications and technical corrections to the rule, including for the scope of environmental health effects information that must be reported and the consumer and commercial product categories to be used for reporting purposes.

EPA Requests for Comment

In addition to public comments on the revisions mentioned above, EPA is soliciting comments on the following questions:

Should EPA amend the scope of reportable chemicals? For instance, EPA indicated in the preamble that the agency is receptive to feedback on the possibility of limiting reporting to PFAS with Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) and adding a production-volume threshold to the rule.

Should EPA modify any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its Economic Analysis? For instance, in the preamble, EPA estimated that a certain percentage of industry costs has already been accrued in preparation for reporting under the October 2023 rule.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday that most of the Department of Energy’s loan program funding will be directed toward nuclear power projects — part of a broader effort to meet growing electricity demands and drive down energy costs.

For years, millions of Americans have watched their energy bills tick upward.

From wildfires to natural gas prices, the causes behind rising energy costs vary across states. Inflation has added pressure, and now artificial intelligence is demanding a huge amount of energy. Data centers powering AI models from companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft require enormous amounts of energy — prompting many of those firms to invest directly in nuclear power.

""Big tech is a key part of the piece that's going to relaunch American nuclear power,"" Wright told The National News Desk. ""They have a huge appetite for power. They want as much as they can get, not just hundreds of megawatts, but gigawatts...They're willing to sign power purchase agreements. That's the thing. You need to build a nuclear power plant. They're willing to put equity capital in front of debt from the loan program office. They're going to be absolutely essential to relaunching the nuclear renaissance.""

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

Last month, the administration finalized an $80 billion agreement with Westinghouse to build new reactors as part of that expansion.

Wright said the biggest challenges ahead are logistical.

“We have President Trump all in. We’re reforming the regulatory regime. We have lots of private capital and government capital to match it,” Wright said. “The problem right now is just execution — having enough workers and supply chain capacity to build these plants as quickly as we’d like.”

Trump has set a long-term goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, a move his administration argues is essential to maintaining the country’s energy independence and supporting the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.",https://fox4beaumont.com/resources/media/c04050b9-6cb7-486d-9024-9a660179619f-Screenshot20251113at3.54.00PM.png,N,,2025-11-14 01:59:38.493848

If we're talking about new vehicle sales, the percentage of electric cars in the U.S. was 7.9% in February 2025, according to Edmunds sales data. This is an improvement of 6.3 percentage points from 2020. This EV market share figure does not include plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), which was measured separately and had their own market share of 1.8% in February 2025. EVs and PHEVs combined made up 9.7% of the vehicles sold in February, which is still far from the 90.3% market share of gas-powered vehicles (including hybrids) sold in that same month.

These percentages offer only a limited insight into the current state of the electric car market, leaving several questions unanswered. Read on to better understand what's happening in the EV market.

What percentage of electric cars are on U.S. roads?

2024, 9.2% of new car registrations were for electric vehicles, according to an Experian Automotive report. This is an increase of 1.2 percentage points from 2023. If we fly higher to a bird's eye view of the roughly 292.3 million cars on the road in 2024, 1.4% of those were electric vehicles.

What is each company's EV market share?

Here are the latest EV market share percentages, from 2024 and through February 2025, according to Edmunds data. Tesla has enjoyed a comfortable lead with the highest market share over the past five years. In recent years, however, Tesla's market share has dwindled from nearly 80% in 2019 to 45.2% in February 2025 as other automakers entered the playing field and introduced more rivals for customers to choose from. Ford maintains a distant second place in market share (7%), while Chevrolet (5.5%) is in third but has made significant progress in just a few years. Volkswagen (4.2%) and Hyundai (3.8%) round out the top five currently, but these automakers could easily switch places as the year goes on.

What are the best-selling electric cars in the U.S. by percentage?

Although Tesla's market share has been falling, the electric carmaker still dominates the market. According to Experian Automotive, the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling electric car in the fourth quarter of 2024, making up 26.1% of new EVs sold. The Model 3 was second with 15%. The Honda Prologue came in third with 5.3%, and the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford Mustang Mach-E held fourth and fifth place with 4.7% and 4.4% market share, respectively.

Last year, Texas, as the No. 1 team, lost to Georgia at home during conference play and again in the Southeastern Conference championship. Now the two teams reunite as the No. 10 Longhorns travel to take on the No. 5 Bulldogs.

Here are the keys to the game as Texas comes off beating then-No. 9 Vanderbilt two weeks ago and after Georgia’s convincing 41-21 win against Mississippi State.

Handle the away crowd

This season, the Longhorns have only lost away games, dropping matchups against then-No. 3 Ohio State to start the year and to an unranked Florida to start conference play.

However, the Longhorns have managed to win away from home in overtime periods against Kentucky and Mississippi State and a neutral-site victory against Oklahoma in Dallas. Against the Bulldogs, the Longhorns pulled off a 17-point comeback in Starkville — known to have an intense environment with its fans ringing cowbells all game long.

If Texas is to win in Athens, Georgia, it will have to quickly adapt to the environment at Sanford Stadium.

“Obviously, this week is a heck of a challenge,” Sarkisian said. “They are a very tough team to play at home. They are 51-2 in their last 53 games at home.”

Contain the Georgia offense

The Texas defense has been one of the best in the country, ranked 22nd for yards allowed per game and 11th for points per game. On Saturday, though, they will be tasked with containing the Bulldog offense.

“They (have) a very balanced offense and attack,” Sarkisian said. “(Redshirt junior quarterback) Gunner Stockton has done a fantastic job of running that offense, creating explosive plays with his arm, with his legs. They’re running the ball effectively.”

While the Longhorn defense only allows 16.4 points per game, Stockton leads a Bulldog offense that scores 33.4 points per game. Stockton has produced 15 passing touchdowns, with only two interceptions this season, while the Texas defense has nine interceptions on the year.

Break down the rushing defense

When Sarkisian calls rushing plays on Saturday, he will have to be wary of Georgia’s 12th ranked rush defense, only allowing 100.2 rushing yards per game. It will be key for the Longhorns to open up the defense to unlock play-action and other passing plays.

Junior running back Quintrevion Wisner currently averages 56.33 yards per game, while sophomore quarterback Arch Manning averages 22.56.

“You got to rush intelligently and violently, and those two don’t always mix,” Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said in his Monday press conference. “It’s hard to do that and contain the quarterback … it’ll be key this week for sure because Arch is really good, they’re really good at protection.”",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-12-25_Keys12_CharliePartheymuller-13.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 03:59:05.565023

Oregon officials acknowledge in the state’s 25-year plan that the largest driver of energy demand in Oregon in at least the next five years will be from data centers.
In future years, they expect electrification in other sectors to meet and eventually outpace demand from data centers.
One would have allowed voters in Umatilla County to exempt the county from a statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities.
The broader energy plan Developing the Oregon Energy Strategy took two years, according to a news release from the state energy department.","As neighboring states clamor to build up or revive dormant nuclear energy sectors to meet rising demand for electricity from data centers in the next few years, Oregon’s energy future includes no such plans.

Instead, the 25-year Oregon Energy Strategy published by the state’s energy department on Wednesday focuses on policy recommendations that will by 2050 increase energy efficiency in buildings and in the industrial and transportation sectors and grow existing clean energy infrastructure. That means the state will rely on more solar, more wind and more alternative energy sources such as thermal and wave energy than fossil fuels.

Nuclear shows up just six times in the 150-page report as something that the state should study for developments and opportunities.

Max Woods, assistant director of nuclear safety and emergency preparedness at the Oregon Department of Energy, said the state is “nuclear curious,” but “taking a more cautious approach that is based on its history and tradition.”

New nuclear plants have been outlawed in Oregon since a voter-approved ballot measure passed in 1980. In 1993, the state’s only nuclear plant closed down. Although the state gets about 3% of its energy annually from a nuclear plant, it’s in Washington and run by the federal Bonneville Power Administration.

“Even if nuclear power were to come to Oregon, it takes a long time to get it through permitting — there’s a lot of security and safety review that has to happen, and for good reason, and they’re (reactors) expensive,” Woods said. “Put those factors together, and that’s a long time to come before any such facility might be built.”

Growing energy demand from data centers in Washington spurred lawmakers there recently to invest $25 million in nuclear energy project development, and Idaho has passed policies meant to clear regulatory hurdles and court private nuclear companies. California lawmakers in 2022 voted to delay closing the state’s only nuclear plant by at least five years while they evaluate potentially reversing course. These decisions are almost entirely being driven by expected demand from data centers in the next few years.

Oregon officials acknowledge in the state’s 25-year plan that the largest driver of energy demand in Oregon in at least the next five years will be from data centers. In future years, they expect electrification in other sectors to meet and eventually outpace demand from data centers. Oregon has among the largest data center markets in the world, which drove electricity consumption in the state up 20% between 2013 and 2023.

“Whether the nuclear power is built in Oregon or not — that’s the question we’re kind of grappling with right now: What the value proposition is for our state,” said Woods. “Our neighbors aren’t really wrestling with that same question.”

But in their 25-year energy planning, state officials found there were faster and more cost-effective ways to meet growing electricity demand than trying to open the state to new nuclear development.

The Oregon Legislature this year considered two proposals that would have opened the door to nuclear development in the state for the first time in decades. One would have allowed voters in Umatilla County to exempt the county from a statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities.

Amazon data centers in eastern Oregon have caused 554% load growth at the Umatilla Electric Cooperative in just the last ten years, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of US Energy Information Administration data.

Another proposal would have directed the state energy department to study what it would take and whether it was worth developing a nuclear sector in Oregon to meet the state’s needs.

Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT. But in the absence of any federally designated and regulated site where spent nuclear waste can be deposited, industry growth has raised concerns for environmental and public health advocates. Most nuclear facilities store radioactive waste in lined underground storage tanks onsite.

To overrule Oregon’s nuclear ban, voters would have to repeal it or the federal government would need to create a national repository for nuclear waste.

The broader energy plan

Developing the Oregon Energy Strategy took two years, according to a news release from the state energy department. It included modeling scenarios that would prioritize affordability and reliability in the state’s energy sector while meeting demand and energy policy and climate change objectives.

Officials made adjustments to changes in federal policy under President Donald Trump, who has in the first ten months of his second term attempted to claw back billions of congressionally approved federal clean energy investments.

Policy recommendations include imposing new reporting requirements for large electricity users, such as data centers, to understand the role such users play in the state’s greenhouse gas pollution, and whether regulations are needed to bring them in line with state climate policies.

Officials recommend establishing a fund to help provide low- and no-cost loans for clean energy projects to support a transition away from fossil fuels, and to establish a state-sponsored block grant program for tribal clean energy projects. Officials also recommend implementing a road use charge for all light duty passenger vehicles, such as Amazon delivery vans, to fund programs that promote electric vehicle adoption.

The plan calls for funding incentive programs for electric bikes and electric vehicles, as well as Safe Routes to School and Great Streets initiatives that encourage bike transportation over cars. It also recommends major overhauls to transmission regulations, including a state-level commission tasked with speeding up new connections to Oregon’s grid.

Key strategy takeaways are that the most cost effective way to reduce energy demand and costs in Oregon is for lawmakers to continue to prioritize policies that accelerate building and transportation electrification. That includes cash incentives that make it more affordable to replace gas cars, gas buses, gas furnaces and appliances with electric ones, to electrify heating and cooling systems and to weatherize homes and businesses.

Models show if this continues, the state’s overall energy demand in 2050 could be 22% lower than it was in 2024, even if there is more demand for electricity in 2050 than currently exists.

Modeling also revealed that delaying policies that accelerate energy efficiency will lead to higher costs down the line given the volatility of fossil fuels markets and climate change. Officials project that in the next few decades, the costs of climate change — such as billion-dollar wildfires, droughts, floods and other extreme weather — could cost the average Oregonian about $12,000 of annual income.

“A key backdrop to this discussion is the growing cost of climate change in Oregon,” they wrote. “Even as energy costs are rising, climate change is driving additional costs for Oregon households, businesses, industries, and government.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boardman-coal-plant-seen-from-crow-butte-1024x683-11763080227.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=kdHeT9b0,N,,2025-11-14 01:59:42.930689

President Donald Trump, who campaigned on expanding U.S. energy production, has made nuclear a centerpiece of his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. “We will embrace all forms of energy, including nuclear,” the president said earlier this year. “Nuclear’s a great energy.”

In May, Trump signed an executive order calling on the U.S. to break ground on 10 new large-scale nuclear reactors by 2030 — the first such expansion effort in decades. Currently, the United States operates 94 nuclear reactors, which provide roughly 19 percent of the country’s electricity, a share that has remained steady since the 1980s.

Wright said the administration is now reviewing potential reactor sites, with announcements expected in the coming months. “We’re looking at locations very carefully,” he said.

The Bank’s delegation is advocating for a pan-African climate narrative that builds on the outcomes of the African Climate Summits and previous COPs. Afreximbank’s engagements are anchored on the core principles of the AU Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and emphasizes the critical role of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in building climate-resilient economies.

A central pillar of the Bank’s advocacy involves mobilising climate finance primarily to support adaptation aspirations of its member countries and ensuring the swift and effective operationalisation of the Loss and Damage Fund. The Bank is also pushing for African countries, who are disproportionately affected by climate events despite contributing less than 4% of global emissions, to receive adequate compensation and to develop the necessary domestic structures to access these funds.

Aligned with President Dr. George Elombi’s vision, Afreximbank is spotlighting the continent’s immense potential in value addition and strategic minerals processing. Instead of exporting raw materials, the Bank is championing financing for entire value chains, such as transforming the Democratic Republic of Congo’s lithium into batteries, to position Africa as a hub for clean technology and create high-skilled jobs.

The Bank is also urging for a just and equitable energy transition that recognizes Africa’s right to address its energy poverty, which leaves over 600 million people without electricity. This includes a balanced approach that integrates renewable energy sources while responsibly utilising transitional fuels like natural gas to power industrialisation.

Afreximbank is committed to helping its member countries to monetise their biodiversity to further help its fight against the debilitating impact of climate change.

Furthermore, Afreximbank is showcasing its financial initiatives, such as the Afreximbank Trade Transformation Fund (ATTF) as one of its key vehicles for de-risking and financing green projects across the continent.

At COP30, the Bank’s participation includes high-level dialogues, thematic panels, and side events, including activities at the African Pavilion and a planned session with Liberia on establishing a carbon markets authority.

Commenting on Afreximbank’s participation at COP30, Mrs. Kanayo Awani, Executive Vice President, Intra-African Trade and Export Development Bank at Afreximbank, stated:

“Our mission at COP30 is clear: to ensure that Africa’s voice is not only heard but heeded. Our approach is one of proactive transformation, adding value to our abundant minerals, powering our industries with a sustainable energy mix, and leveraging the AfCFTA to build resilient, integrated economies. We are leveraging our influence to mobilise Global African capital and demand a globally recognised and supported framework for our continent’s just energy transition that ensures comprehensive climate action actively serves and reinforces Africa’s ambitions for development and industrialisation.”

Summary

Toyota has begun production at its new $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina — the company’s first in-house battery facility outside Japan. The site will make batteries for hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4, and a not-yet-announced three-row electric vehicle. Toyota says the plant will eventually house 14 production lines and employ about 5,000 people.

Alongside the plant launch, Toyota confirmed plans to invest up to $10 billion in U.S. operations over the next five years, a figure previously referenced by President Trump but not formally confirmed until now. Toyota frames the move as part of a “multi-pathway” strategy that keeps hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric and fuel-cell options on the table as demand patterns evolve.

Key Points

Toyota opened a $13.9bn battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina — its first in-house battery facility outside Japan.

The plant will supply batteries for hybrid Camry, Corolla Cross and RAV4 models and a future three-row EV.

Planned capacity: 14 production lines and roughly 5,000 jobs when fully ramped.

Toyota confirmed up to $10bn more investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next five years.

The announcement follows shifts in the market: EV demand has cooled while hybrid demand has risen, playing to Toyota’s strengths.

Policy context matters: the move comes amid changing U.S. rules on fuel economy and EV tax credits and has received government praise.

Toyota emphasises a multi-pathway approach (gas, hybrids, plug-ins, battery and fuel-cell tech) rather than an all-in EV bet.

Context and relevance

This is significant for several reasons. Reshoring battery manufacturing strengthens the U.S. supply chain for electrified vehicles and reduces reliance on overseas suppliers. The plant creates thousands of local jobs and will ripple out to parts suppliers, logistics providers and regional infrastructure. For the automotive market, Toyota’s bet on hybrids — backed by new domestic battery capacity — signals that the transition to all-electric vehicles may be more gradual and varied than some forecasts assume.

For procurement, manufacturing and supply-chain teams, this means planning for increased domestic battery component demand, potential shifts in supplier relationships, and nearer-term capacity for hybrid powertrains. For policy watchers, the timing highlights how regulation and tax incentives influence corporate investment choices.

Why should I read this?

Short answer: because this is where the jobs, factories and battery cells are actually being built — not just promised. Big cash, thousands of jobs, and a strategic signal from Toyota that hybrids still matter. If you work in automotive, supply chain, regional economic development or logistics, this move will affect supplier networks, hiring and investment decisions. We’ve skimmed the detail so you don’t have to — but it pays to know the specifics.

Commentary Revisions to EPA’s TSCA PFAS reporting rule were both widely expected and hotly anticipated.
Not surprisingly, the proposed rule announced Monday would exempt article importers — a savings to small businesses estimated to exceed $700 million.
Recall, however, that this is a proposed rule; time will tell what comments EPA receives and what sticks in the final rule.
EPA’s proposed rule does not appear to account for burden already incurred in its calculations of burden reduction.","On November 13, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed rule to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) regulation for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 90 Fed. Reg. 50923. As reported in our October 3, 2023, memorandum, the final rule requires manufacturers (including importers) of PFAS and PFAS-containing articles in any year since 2011 through 2022 to report information related to chemical identity, uses, volumes made and processed, byproducts, environmental and health effects, worker exposure, and disposal to EPA. The proposed rule would incorporate exemptions to the scope of reportable manufacturing activities for a de minimis exemption of 0.1 percent; imported articles; byproducts; impurities; research and development (R&D); and non-isolated intermediates. According to EPA’s proposed rule, these exemptions “would maintain important reporting on PFAS, consistent with statutory requirements, while exempting reporting on activities about which manufacturers are least likely to know or reasonably ascertain.” Comments are due December 29, 2025. According to the proposed rule, comments on the information collection provisions of this proposed rule under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) must be received by the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) on or before December 15, 2025.

Proposed Exemptions to the Scope of Reportable Manufacturing Activities

EPA proposes to add certain exemptions to the scope of reportable PFAS manufacturing activities under 40 C.F.R. Part 705. EPA states that it intends these exemptions to be similar to the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule (40 C.F.R. Part 711) and, in addition, proposes to include a de minimis exemption. EPA notes that in some scenarios, more than one of the proposed exemptions may provide the same regulatory relief from reporting. For example, an importer of articles that contain low levels of PFAS may be exempt from reporting by both the imported articles and de minimis exemptions. EPA “is interested in public comments on potential means to consolidate the proposed exemptions, while providing the same regulatory relief and in public comments on the potential benefits and drawbacks of finalizing all proposed exemptions or a subset of proposed exemptions when viewed in combination.”

De Minimis

EPA proposes a de minimis concentration exemption for reportable PFAS in mixtures or articles under which PFAS concentrations below 0.1 percent would be exempt from reporting. EPA notes that this exemption would apply regardless of total production volume of the mixture or article. According to EPA, the proposed de minimis level of 0.1 percent is appropriate because of the retrospective nature of the reporting and contemporary recordkeeping practices. During the lookback period for reporting, reporters are unlikely to have records of PFAS amounts below 0.1 percent due to the U.S. and international requirements at the time for labeling and recordkeeping.

EPA states that it also proposes to exempt these de minimis concentrations of PFAS in mixtures and articles from the scope of the rule based on the Agency’s information needs under TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A). According to EPA, it “has determined that information about such PFAS in mixtures is unnecessary, in part because EPA does not anticipate publishing an ‘inventory’ of all PFAS manufactured since 2011 such that EPA would need a complete reporting of all PFAS in U.S. markets.” EPA additionally notes that it does not anticipate evaluating PFAS that may only be manufactured in de minimis levels in the near future under TSCA.

Imported Articles

EPA proposes to exempt PFAS imported as part of an article from the scope of reportable activities. EPA states that it recognizes that importing PFAS in articles between 2011 and 2022 is an activity about which manufacturers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information. As EPA noted in its discussion of the de minimis exemption, safety data sheet (SDS) and European Union (EU) Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation notification requirements “are not likely to have revealed the content of PFAS in imported articles during the time span covered by this retroactive reporting rule, which is a perspective shared widely by commenters and the small entity representatives to the [Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR)] Panel.” According to EPA, it “has now reconsidered the weight of that input and now proposes to exempt importing articles in an effort to apply reporting obligations, to the extent feasible, to those persons likely to have information (TSCA section 8(a)(5)(C)).”

EPA also proposes the imported articles exemption under TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), “as the Agency finds that requiring retroactive reporting on importing articles with PFAS is unnecessary.” EPA states that, on balance, it “finds it unnecessary to require reporting for this activity and impose related non-reporting burden activities such as rule compliance determination and due diligence record searches when such importers are unlikely to have relevant information.”

In addition, EPA proposes that requiring reporting from importers of articles containing PFAS exceeded its authority under TSCA Section 8(a)(7). In the fiscal year (FY) 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Congress directed EPA to require reporting from “each person who has manufactured a chemical substance that is a [PFAS].” (Emphasis in original.) EPA notes that “Congress chose to target manufacturers (including importers) of the PFAS themselves, as indicated by the specific phrase ‘that is a’ (instead of a more inclusive term such as ‘contains’).”

Byproducts, Impurities, and Non-Isolated Intermediates

EPA proposes to exempt the manufacture of PFAS as byproducts, impurities, nonisolated intermediates, or upon incidental exposure, or end use of another substance or mixture from the scope of reportable activities when such substances are manufactured under conditions described in 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h). EPA notes that these proposed exemptions align with existing exemptions under TSCA for substances not manufactured and used for a separate commercial purpose and is consistent with the approach taken in EPA’s CDR rule. EPA states that “[o]verall, the exemptions reflect a practical application of TSCA section 8(a)(5)(C), under which EPA shall, to the extent feasible, apply reporting obligations only to those persons likely to have relevant information.” According to EPA, as proposed, the exemptions “would ensure that manufacturers remain focused on reporting PFAS with greater commercial relevance and potential exposure pathways while relieving industry of disproportionately burdensome reporting.”

Byproducts

The regulation currently requires a manufacturer of PFAS to report in separate chemical reports each PFAS that is manufactured, without exception. EPA proposes to exempt any byproduct not used for commercial purposes. “Byproduct” is defined in 40 C.F.R. Section 704.3 to mean “a chemical substance produced without a separate commercial intent during the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of another chemical substance(s) or mixture(s).” EPA states that it proposes this exemption “because it now believes this information is unnecessary to implement its statutory obligations and potentially duplicative.” Consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), EPA believes it is appropriate to exempt manufacturers of PFAS as a byproduct when they are not used for a commercial purpose. EPA notes that it is interested in learning about the intended commercial uses of PFAS, including PFAS manufactured as a byproduct, and thus is not proposing to exempt manufacture of PFAS as a byproduct if it is used for a commercial purpose. According to EPA, the exemption would not apply to component substances extracted from a byproduct when the extracted substances are reportable PFAS.

Impurities

EPA proposes to exempt the manufacture of PFAS as impurities from the scope of reportable activities. EPA notes that this exemption is also incorporated in the CDR regulation. EPA states that as defined at 40 C.F.R. Section 704.3, an impurity is a chemical substance unintentionally present with another chemical substance. An impurity is not manufactured for distribution in commerce as a chemical substance per se, and it has no distinct commercial purpose apart from the substance, mixture, or article in which it is contained.

EPA proposes that, consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), requiring this information is unnecessary. As explained in CDR guidance, in evaluating whether a PFAS is an impurity, EPA considers the source of the substance in the manufacturing process. According to EPA, a substance arising unintentionally in a final product because it was introduced unintentionally as a component of a raw material may be considered an impurity. EPA notes that this is distinguishable from a byproduct, which is a substance formed as part of the intended chemical reaction or byproduct stream, and if intentionally retained, would not meet the definition of an impurity and may be subject to reporting.

According to EPA, there are likely no PFAS manufactured as impurities domestically, as PFAS are not likely to be unintentionally present in raw materials introduced into a process. Thus, the manufacture of PFAS as impurities would only derive from the import of materials with PFAS as impurities. EPA notes that such importers are unlikely to know about the presence of PFAS, let alone any reportable information under TSCA Section 8(a)(7). EPA states that such an exemption would therefore be consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(C), which requires EPA to, to the extent feasible, extend reporting obligations to those likely to have relevant information.

Non-Isolated Intermediates

Consistent with the proposed exemptions to align with 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h), EPA proposes to exempt otherwise-reportable PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates. Non-isolated intermediates, as defined at 40 C.F.R. Section 704.3, are substances manufactured and consumed within a closed system during the production of another chemical substance. These intermediates are not intentionally removed from process equipment and are not stored, packaged, or transported. EPA states that because these substances remain confined within closed systems and are not expected to be released in the environment or handled by workers, it “has determined that reporting on non-isolated intermediates is unnecessary because these intermediates do not result in meaningful human or environmental exposure.” EPA proposes this exemption consistent with TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A). EPA notes additionally that manufacturers have generally not been required to submit reports related to the manufacture of non-isolated intermediates under TSCA. According to EPA, it has exempted non-isolated intermediates in the past, in part because such substances often are extremely difficult to identify.

R&D Chemicals

EPA proposes to exempt PFAS manufactured (including imported) in small quantities for R&D purposes. EPA highlights that the proposed exemption, while limited to PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes, has no threshold limit. EPA notes that “such quantities manufactured solely for R&D purposes are quantities no greater than reasonably necessary for those R&D activities.” EPA states that based on stakeholder input, it understands that information on PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes would be limited and would provide minimal information regarding PFAS exposures and quantities in commerce, which were the focuses of TSCA Section 8(a)(7). Pursuant to TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A), EPA has determined information about such chemicals is unnecessary but “may consider future data calls for R&D chemicals if the Agency determines a need to do so.”

Submission Period

EPA proposes to amend the data submission period to accommodate the changes to the reporting scope in the proposed rule, with the submission period beginning 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and lasting three months. EPA states that the time it took to develop the 2023 final rule and engage with stakeholders on the content of the rule, as well as the time that has passed since promulgation of the final rule, “suggests to the Agency that reporters have had adequate time to consider how they intend to comply with the rule.” EPA notes that because no reporting will be required from article importers due to the proposed exemption, EPA proposes to remove the reporting deadline for small manufacturers that would report under the rule exclusively as article importers.

Clarifications and Technical Corrections

Scope of Environmental and Health Effects Information

EPA notes that the current rule requires the submission of exposure-related information and “all existing information concerning the environmental and health effects” of the chemical substances covered by this rule. In addition, certain information is required to be reported using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-harmonized template (OHT) format. EPA proposes to clarify the requirements related to reporting using the OHT format, including to propose a regulatory change to confirm that OHTs are required for unpublished study reports on the environmental and health effects of the reportable PFAS, except for exposure information provided in the fielded data elements throughout the reporting application.

Consumer and Commercial Product Categories

EPA proposes to update the names used for specific consumer and commercial product categories as required under 40 C.F.R. Section 705.15(c)(4). EPA notes that this proposed change would not alter any reporting requirements or introduce new burden but rather aims to clarify existing requirements. EPA states that it has received requests for clarification from data submitters under the CDR regulation, which uses the same product category names, so EPA proposes to clarify the names and descriptions for the same consumer and commercial article related codes in the PFAS Data Reporting Rule.

Requests for Comment

EPA requests comment on the content of this proposed rule and the Economic Analysis prepared in support of the proposed rule that will be available in the docket when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. In addition, EPA has provided the following list of issues on which it is specifically requesting public comment. EPA requests that commenters include materials supporting their rationale to the extent possible.

EPA is soliciting comment on the proposed 0.1 percent de minimis exemption for PFAS in mixtures and articles. EPA is also interested in comments on a 1.0 percent de minimis exemption for PFAS in mixtures and articles instead of the proposed 0.1 percent de minimis exemption, or another appropriate de minimis level.

EPA is soliciting comment on an imported articles exemption. EPA is also interested in comments on its reconsidered interpretation of the statutory language of the NDAA and whether the NDAA is best read as excluding articles from the scope of reporting.

EPA is soliciting comment on exempting certain byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates by incorporating the exemptions at 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h). This exemption would extend to PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance or mixture based on conditions described in 40 C.F.R. Section 720.30(h)(3)-(7).

EPA is soliciting comment on an exemption for manufacturing PFAS in small quantities for R&D activities.

EPA is soliciting comment on whether its proposed amendment to the data submission period is appropriate to accommodate the proposed changes to the PFAS Data Reporting Rule.

EPA is soliciting comment on the requirements related to reporting using the OHT format, including to propose a regulatory change to confirm that OHTs are required for unpublished study reports on the environmental and health effects of the reportable PFAS, except for exposure information provided in the fielded data elements throughout the reporting application. EPA states that it has not quantified and is also soliciting comment on the potential burden with the OHT requirement for unpublished study reports under 40 C.F.R. Section 705.15(f). Additionally, in response to stakeholder requests that EPA has received, EPA is soliciting comment on whether to maintain the requirement for full study reports under 40 C.F.R. Section 705.15(f) or to provide an option for a submitter to provide a robust study summary in lieu of the full study report, with the submitter to provide the full study report upon reasonable EPA request, such as when technical concerns about the data or methodology as described in the summary are identified or the Agency deems that the summary is not robust. EPA “continues to maintain its position that full study reports are necessary; however, the Agency is amenable to receiving further perspectives on this topic to further inform its understanding of stakeholder concerns.”

EPA is soliciting comment on the nature and extent of any reliance interests that may have arisen from the October 11, 2023, TSCA Section 8(a)(7) final rule.

In addition to the topics listed above and proposed in this action, EPA is also soliciting comment on specific questions discussed below:

Should EPA amend the scope of reportable chemicals? EPA is not proposing changes to the scope of reportable chemical substances but is soliciting comment on this topic. EPA states that it “is receptive to feedback on a possible means to lower burden by modifying the scope of reportable substances,” such as by limiting reporting to those PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number® (CAS RN®), or, in the case of a PFAS listed as confidential on the TSCA Inventory, a TSCA Accession Number or Low-Volume Exemption Number. Although EPA is not proposing to provide a production-volume threshold, EPA “is amenable to comments regarding the benefits and/or drawbacks of providing such a threshold and what would be an appropriate threshold. EPA would also be interested in comments on whether such a threshold would either make other proposed exemptions unnecessary or impact their scope, e.g., the de minimis threshold.”

Should EPA modify any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its Economic Analysis? EPA specifically seeks comments and data to consider in developing an Economic Analysis for a final rule. EPA states that in this proposed rule’s Economic Analysis, it assumes that 255 manufacturing firms have undergone all compliance determination and rule familiarization activities, and 20,985 article importers have undergone some level of compliance determination and rule familiarization since the promulgation of the final rule on October 11, 2023. Therefore, EPA estimates that approximately five percent of the estimated total industry cost for the 2023 final rule has already occurred. EPA seeks comment on its assumptions, including on the sunk costs estimates and on the assumption that the exemption for article importers and the 26 percent reduction in reporting from manufacturers would not result in a large reduction in benefits. EPA requests any information that can be provided to refine its estimates related to cost savings of this proposed action.

Commentary

Revisions to EPA’s TSCA PFAS reporting rule were both widely expected and hotly anticipated. The October 2023 final rule’s steep price tag and reach that extended far beyond the typical set of TSCA regulated entities created significant angst across the business community. These concerns were amplified by the rule’s bumpy rollout, including delays in the development of the necessary reporting tool that left EPA scrambling to extend the reporting window — not once, but twice. It was not difficult to predict that EPA would offer some course-corrections in the new Administration. Administrator Zeldin’s April 2025 PFAS announcement included a specific reference to TSCA Section 8(a)(7), vowing to implement the provision “smartly” and “without overburdening small businesses and article importers.” And in the May 2025 notice extending the reporting window for the second time, EPA foreshadowed that it was considering reopening parts of the final rule to public comment.

Not surprisingly, the proposed rule announced Monday would exempt article importers — a savings to small businesses estimated to exceed $700 million. This exemption, by far, offered the most bang-for-the-buck savings in the proposed rule, purporting to eliminate a whopping 80 percent of the 2023 final rule’s $876 million total cost. It was less clear what other exemptions, if any, EPA would choose to put into the proposed rule. EPA had previously taken a firm position that reporting exemptions were inappropriate based on a strict reading of the 2020 NDAA provision that created the impetus for action and the text of TSCA Section 8(a)(7) itself. EPA’s prior messaging suggested an overarching view that Congress intended the one-time reporting requirement to be a swift and comprehensive vehicle for EPA’s collection of large amounts of PFAS information that would accelerate the pace of efforts to address this issue.

The proposed rule marks a clear shift in EPA’s thinking and one likely to invite controversy. First, EPA no longer interprets any sort of statutory limitation to including reporting exemptions — a notable reversal. EPA now seemingly departs from its own prior argument that Section 8(a)(7) operates as freestanding, independent rulemaking authority and instead reads Section 8(a)(7) in the larger context of Section 8(a), including the provisions of TSCA Section 8(a)(5). Section 8(a)(5) mandates explicit considerations regarding burden reduction and small manufacturers. EPA also argues that the previous application of the rule to articles importers exceeded EPA’s statutory authority — a position framed narrowly, but one that could have significant implications for the decades-long interpretation by EPA that import of an article containing a chemical substance constitutes “manufacture” of that chemical under TSCA. The exemptions in the proposed rule largely align with a May 2025 industry petition that sought these changes — a petition that was withdrawn after EPA indicated it would reopen the rule. In addition to exemptions typical of other TSCA Section 8(a) reporting rules (e.g., article imports, impurities, certain byproducts), EPA also asserts inherent statutory authority to establish a “de minimis” threshold, noting that the retrospective nature of reporting and the absence of commensurate domestic and international recordkeeping requirements diminish the likelihood that a reporting requirement for de minimis quantities would actually bear any fruit, blunting or eliminating any justification for the burden on reporters. On the whole, EPA’s rationale for this and other exemptions include very thoughtful and pragmatic balancing regarding where the Agency expects to be most successful in collecting PFAS information versus areas EPA views as adding burden for little or no foreseeable benefit. EPA addresses the efficacy of testing as a source of information; we are somewhat surprised at this discussion because one cannot test in the past. At best, testing a product that was imported in 2025 might tell you what PFAS is present in the current product. A past product could have very different levels (higher or lower) of PFAS. Second, the substance and tone in the proposed rule reflect a more realistic view of the utility of the data that may be collected. This is apparent both in the extent of reporting exemptions — a significant narrowing of requirements that may or may not also reduce incoming information — and EPA’s suggestion of a potential phased or sequenced approach under which it defers additional reporting beyond the narrowed requirements in the proposed rule “until there is a clear role that such information could play to support a program mission of the Agency.” PFAS remains a dominant topic in the national conversation and has for years now been a significant focus and priority for Congress, states, industry and non-governmental organization (NGO) stakeholders, the public, and EPA across multiple administrations. It will be interesting to monitor reactions to the proposed rule and assess whether EPA’s primary focus on burden reduction will withstand the scrutiny of those who have been relentlessly advocating for more EPA action on PFAS. EPA does not offer exemptions for PFAS polymers or one specific to small businesses, although there is some overlap between some of the proposed exemptions and (in particular) import by small businesses.

As with the active/inactive reporting and quadrennial obligation under the CDR rule, this is yet another opportunity for the potential disclosure of Confidential Business Information (CBI). As always, submitters will have to consider carefully what information must be protected as CBI and how a submitter will be able to substantiate its CBI claims.

Detractors will undoubtedly decry any relief for potential reporters, but as we have discussed previously, the retrospective nature of the reporting and its significant look-back period will make it difficult to find any meaningful information in past records, especially for small quantities and content in articles. In this proposed rule, EPA explicitly acknowledges that the burden is largely felt during the research for reportable information, not in the reporting itself. Each potential reporter must — within the meaning of “reasonably ascertainable” — review records maybe over a decade old to determine if the reporter has any information that is potentially reportable. Recall, however, that this is a proposed rule; time will tell what comments EPA receives and what sticks in the final rule. Time will also tell if EPA issues future reporting requirements, either for retrospective or prospective manufacture or import.

The regulated community will no doubt breathe some collective sighs of relief. But one can assume there are also some simmering frustrations that the rollbacks came so late. Presumably a fair number of regulated entities took steps — and perhaps substantial and expensive steps — to put their business in a position to comply when the reporting window opened, only to have that deadline extended days prior (twice). EPA’s proposed rule does not appear to account for burden already incurred in its calculations of burden reduction. We may find ourselves in a similar position in 2026 when the final rule will be published if there are substantial changes and again if litigation requires EPA to make further changes to the rule.

Companies may also lament the apparent waste effort of preparing to report under the previous rule, but Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. submits that any early and/or ongoing due diligence to understand where PFAS is or may be present in your products or supply chain is time well spent. The domestic (federal and state) and international landscape of PFAS reporting and regulatory requirements is growing ever more complex by the day, and companies are urged to stay ahead of the curve. A final related note on the proposed timeframe for reporting: In a clear acknowledgement of reporters’ efforts already undertaken to prepare for the previous reporting deadline, EPA is proposing that the reporting window open just two months after publication of a final rule and stay open for only three months. For those who have not yet opened your file cabinets, now is the time. Once final, it will be a scramble to get reporting prepared and submitted.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-11/Pollution%20Microplastics%20Plastic%20Particles%20on%20Finger%20PFAS%20SMALLER.jpg.webp?itok=0qBCLjTD,N,,2025-11-14 06:59:12.553808

Budget 2025 confirms these changes and further increases the expenditure limit for the enhanced 35% refundable credit to $6 million.","The 2025 Federal Budget (Budget 2025) introduced a number of business income tax measures aimed at stimulating investment and accelerating the transition to a clean economy. Key initiatives include temporary immediate expensing for manufacturing and processing buildings, reinstated and enhanced accelerated capital cost allowance rates for LNG facilities, significant expansions to the Scientific Research and Experimental Development program, and targeted incentives for clean technology, critical minerals, and carbon capture projects. Budget 2025 also addresses a technical tax concern by tightening rules on refundable tax deferrals within Canadian corporate groups.

Immediate expensing for manufacturing and processing buildings

The capital cost allowance (CCA) system enables businesses to deduct the cost of depreciable property over time, with rates designed to reflect the useful life of assets. Under current rules, manufacturing or processing buildings in Canada qualify for a combined CCA rate of 10%, 4% under Class 1, plus an additional 6% provided that at least 90% of the building’s floor space is dedicated to manufacturing or processing goods for sale or lease.

Budget 2025 introduces a temporary measure allowing immediate expensing for eligible manufacturing or processing buildings and qualifying improvements. This means taxpayers can claim a full 100% deduction in the first year the property is used for manufacturing or processing, provided the 90% usage requirement is met. Eligible additions or alterations to such buildings acquired on or after November 4, 2025 (“Budget Day”) and used before 2030 will also qualify for this accelerated deduction.

To be eligible, the property must be acquired on or after Budget Day, become available for use before 2030, and meet the 90% floor space requirement. Used property may qualify if it was not previously owned by the taxpayer or a non-arm’s-length person and was not transferred on a tax-deferred rollover basis. Recapture rules may apply if the building’s use changes after the deduction is claimed.

The measure applies to property first used before 2030. For later years, the enhanced deduction phases out: 75% for property first used in 2030 or 2031, 55% for property first used in 2032 or 2033, and no enhanced rate after 2033. After this period, the regular CCA rules will resume.

Accelerated CCA rates for LNG equipment and related buildings

The accelerated CCA for liquefied natural gas (LNG) equipment and related buildings expired at the end of 2024. Budget 2025 proposes to reinstate accelerated CCA for property acquired on or after Budget Day and before 2035, provided it is used in low-carbon LNG facilities. Eligibility will depend on meeting new emissions performance standards. Facilities in the top 25% for emissions performance will qualify for the same accelerated rates previously available, 30% for LNG equipment and 10% for non-residential buildings. Facilities in the top 10% will qualify for an enhanced rate of 50% for LNG equipment and 10% for related buildings. Facilities outside the top 25% will not be eligible. Details on the emissions performance requirements will be released at a later date.

Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax credit

The SR&ED tax incentive program allows businesses to deduct qualifying expenditures in the year they are incurred and generally claim an investment tax credit. Under current rules, Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) can claim a fully refundable investment tax credit at an enhanced rate of 35% on up to $3 million of qualifying SR&ED expenditures annually. This expenditure limit is phased out for CCPCs with taxable capital employed in Canada between $10 million and $50 million in the previous year and is shared among associated corporations.

The 2024 Fall Economic Statement proposed increasing the expenditure limit to $4.5 million and raising the taxable capital phase-out thresholds to $15 million and $75 million. Budget 2025 confirms these changes and further increases the expenditure limit for the enhanced 35% refundable credit to $6 million. These measures apply to taxation years beginning on or after December 16, 2024. Budget 2025 also extends eligibility for the 35% refundable credit to certain Canadian public corporations and restores eligibility for specific capital expenditures under the SR&ED program.

In addition to legislative changes, Budget 2025 announces significant administrative reforms to improve program efficiency. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will introduce an elective pre-claim approval process to provide upfront technical approval of eligible projects, cutting review times for these claims to 90 days from 180 days. The CRA will also increase the use of artificial intelligence to streamline low-risk claims, eliminate unnecessary steps, and reduce burdensome information requirements. These administrative changes are expected to take effect April 1, 2026, alongside targeted consultations to further modernize the program, including a review of Form T661.

Clean economy and climate competitiveness strategy

Budget 2025 reinforces Canada’s commitment to building a clean economy by introducing a climate competitiveness strategy aimed at creating an investment environment that positions Canadian businesses to compete globally. A key component of this strategy is the continued use of targeted tax incentives to accelerate the adoption of clean energy and technology.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Investment Tax Credit (CCUS ITC)

The CCUS ITC provides a refundable credit of up to 60% for eligible costs incurred to acquire or install equipment used in qualifying carbon capture projects where captured carbon dioxide is put to an approved use. The credit rate varies based on the type of equipment and the timing of the expenditure.

For expenditures incurred from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2030, full rates apply:

60% for equipment used in direct air capture projects;

50% for equipment used in other carbon capture projects; and

37.5% for transportation, storage, and utilization equipment.

Initially, these rates were scheduled to drop by half starting in 2031. However, Budget 2025 extends the full rates until December 31, 2035, after which reduced rates will apply for expenditures incurred between 2036 and 2040.

Additionally, Budget 2025 postpones the Government’s planned review of the CCUS ITC. Instead of conducting the review before 2030 as announced in the 2022 Federal Budget, the review will now occur before 2035.

Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit (CTM ITC)

The CTM ITC provides a refundable credit of 30% on eligible capital costs for property used in clean technology manufacturing. The credit applies to property acquired and available for use after December 31, 2023, and before January 1, 2035, provided the property is used in a qualifying manufacturing activity.

A qualifying use includes activities that produce all or substantially all qualifying materials, which currently include lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and graphite. The credit begins to phase out gradually, starting in 2032.

To encourage investment in the extraction, processing, and recycling of critical mineral co-products and by-products, Budget 2025 proposes to expand the list of critical minerals eligible for this investment tax credit to include antimony, indium, gallium, germanium, and scandium.

This expanded definition applies to clean technology manufacturing property acquired and available for use on or after Budget Day.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (CE ITC)

The CE ITC is a refundable tax credit equal to 15% of the capital cost of eligible property used for low-emission electricity generation, electricity storage, and interprovincial or territorial transmission infrastructure. The credit applies to property acquired and available for use on or after April 16, 2024, for projects that began construction on or after March 28, 2023. Under existing rules, the capital cost of eligible property is reduced by any government or non-government assistance received.

Budget 2025 introduces two significant changes.

First, the Canada Growth Fund (CGF) is now recognized as a qualifying entity for the CE ITC, acknowledging its role as an equity investor in clean electricity projects. Importantly, financing provided by the CGF will not reduce the capital cost of an eligible property for the purpose of calculating the credit. This measure aligns with similar treatment previously granted to the Canada Infrastructure Bank. These changes apply to property acquired and available for use on or after Budget Day.

Second, Budget 2025 removes conditions previously imposed on provincial and territorial Crown corporations to be eligible, which required jurisdictions to commit to achieving net-zero by 2050, pass credit benefits to ratepayers, and meet public reporting requirements. These changes are expected to apply retroactively to property acquired and available for use since April 16, 2024.

Finally, Budget 2025 announces the Government’s intention to consult Canadians on introducing domestic content requirements for both the CE ITC and the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit. Further details on this consultation will be provided at a later date. Legislation to implement the CE ITC is expected soon, with retroactive application anticipated.

Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC)

Flow-through shares allow qualifying corporations to renounce certain exploration expenses to investors, enabling those investors to deduct the expenses in calculating their taxable income. The CMETC provides an additional benefit by granting a non-refundable tax credit equal to 30% of specified Canadian exploration expenses incurred in mining activities primarily targeting designated critical minerals.

Currently, critical minerals eligible for the CMETC include nickel, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth elements, vanadium, tellurium, gallium, scandium, titanium, magnesium, zinc, platinum group metals, uranium, and lithium (including lithium from brines). Budget 2025 expands this list to include bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten. Once enacted, Canadian exploration expenses related to these minerals will qualify for the credit if renounced under a flow-through share agreement. This expanded eligibility applies to agreements entered into after Budget Day and on or before March 31, 2027.

The definition of Canadian Exploration Expense (CEE)

CEE represents a category of deductible costs that mining corporations can transfer to investors through flow-through shares. Investors who acquire these shares are entitled to claim a 100% immediate deduction for the renounced CEE when calculating taxable income and may qualify for further incentives, such as the flow-through mining expenditure tax credit or the CMETC.

Under current provisions of the Tax Act, CEE includes expenses incurred to determine the quality of a mineral resource in Canada. Budget 2025 proposes to amend these rules to clarify that such expenses do not include costs related to assessing the economic viability or engineering feasibility of the resource. This clarification is intended to nullify the impact of the recent British Columbia Supreme Court decision in Seabridge Gold Inc. v. British Columbia (2025 BCSC 558), which held that “quality” could encompass expenses related to determining economic viability under the provincial equivalent of CEE. The proposed amendment will apply as of Budget Day.

Refundable tax on investment income and proposed changes

Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) and substantive CCPCs pay a refundable tax on investment income, which can later be recovered when taxable dividends are paid, based on the assumption that individual shareholders will be taxed on those dividends. Under existing rules, an additional refundable tax under Part IV of the Tax Act applies to private corporations and certain non-private corporations that receive taxable dividends from a “connected corporation” (generally where the recipient controls the payer or owns more than 10% of its voting shares and value) if the payer is entitled to a refund of its own refundable taxes.

Currently, if the recipient corporation’s balance-due day for this additional tax falls after the payer corporation’s balance-due day for the year in which the dividend was paid, the payment of refundable tax can effectively be deferred. This deferral can be extended by moving dividends through a chain of connected corporations with different year ends.

Budget 2025 seeks to curb this deferral strategy by introducing a rule for dividends paid between affiliated corporations (as defined under existing Tax Act affiliation rules). Under the proposal, the payer corporation’s refund would be suspended if the recipient corporation’s balance-due day for the year in which the dividend is received is later than the payer’s balance-due day. This measure would apply to dividends paid in taxation years beginning on or after Budget Day.

Two exceptions are proposed:

Acquisition of control: Dividends paid by a corporation that undergoes an acquisition of control within 30 days of payment will be exempt. This accommodates pre-closing dividends often paid during share sale transactions, which could otherwise be caught by the rule due to the deemed year-end triggered by the acquisition.

Subsequent dividend payments: Where each recipient corporation in the chain pays a dividend on or before its own balance-due day, the rule will not apply, as no deferral would occur in such cases.

Missing measures

Two anticipated tax measures that we noted in our Post 2025-election – Tax policies expected under the new Canadian Government, were absent from Budget 2025:

the introduction of an innovation-focused flow-through share regime, and

a patent box regime.

These omissions are significant because both initiatives were highlighted in the Liberal Party’s April 2025 election platform. The proposed flow-through share regime was expected to support sectors such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing, modeled on the existing regime for mining exploration companies. Similarly, the patent box regime, designed to encourage the commercialization of intellectual property in Canada, was the subject of a Department of Finance consultation in 2024 alongside the SR&ED program. Budget 2025 provides no indication as to whether these proposals have been deferred or abandoned.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dlapiperukl0cbf-dlapiperba5d-devd44d-3fa6/media/project/dlapiper-tenant/dlapiper/brand-images/dla-piper-og-image-default-logo.jpg?h=1302&iar=0&w=2500,N,,2025-11-14 04:59:39.536508

The program will provide funding for up to 25 rental units citywide. Applications are open now through December 6, 2025.

Funded through the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, the REM Program aims to strengthen Somerville’s rental housing stock by incentivizing small landlords to complete energy-efficiency and decarbonization projects. The program is designed to complement existing Mass Save incentives and make it easier for property owners to pursue improvements that benefit both landlords and renters.

“Somerville is committed to increasing energy efficiency in every home, including the many rental units that make our community vibrant and accessible,” said Mayor Ballantyne. “This program provides an extra boost for landlords making green upgrades — a win for property owners, a win for tenants, and a win for our climate goals.”

Benefits of participating include:

Increased property value

Access to additional state incentives

Improved tenant comfort and retention

A healthier, more efficient home environment

Because tenants often pay utility costs directly, rental units can lag behind owner-occupied homes in pursuing energy improvements — even with strong state incentives. The REM Program helps close that gap by offering supplemental funding for eligible projects in small multifamily buildings (2–4 units).

To receive a microgrant, projects must meet program eligibility requirements, submit all required documentation, and be completed by November 2, 2026.
