Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM's leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

Duncan Aldred may be the one automotive executive not sweating over the anticipated slowdown of the U.S. electric vehicle market.

Aldred, GM’s senior vice president and president of North America, is in a critical position: leading GM’s most profitable but challenging markets.

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. trail other major car markets where the global company does business, which was not expected to be the case when GM first planned its broad EV portfolio. Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra said onstage at an industry event that “up until a year ago, we were on a journey to a regulatory environment where we had to drive EVs.”

Still, GM invested significant money and planning to offer the range of EVs it has today. Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM's leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

“We believe EVs will remain a strong part of the GM portfolio. Quite honestly, it’s one of the reasons why our market share has grown so much this year,” Aldred said. “It’s not something (we), in any way, shape or form, expect to give up.”

Year to date, GM estimates that its 17.2% market share across vehicle propulsion systems is the highest it's been in 10 years. So far this year, EV total sales more than doubled to 144,668 vehicles.

GM's public pledge to produce only electric vehicles by 2035 — put forth before President Donald Trump’s first administration amid a stricter regulatory environment for climate protections — has largely been scrapped.

Congress passed a bill ending the tax credit offered to electric car buyers of up to $7,500 on the purchase of qualifying new vehicles and $4,000 on qualifying used EVs on Sept. 30, years before its original expiration.

Ford and General Motors have since said they will extend some incentive programs through leases until year-end to transition away from government support, but GM backed outof that program after concerns were raised about it by U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy. Ford also has backtracked.

In the 10 years since GM developed its strategy to develop a full portfolio of EVs, seismic issues repeatedly roiled the industry and put strain on the company’s capital.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said at a media event Sept. 30 that GM's dominance in the EV sales space is largely due to the range of vehicles GM offers.

“We've been No. 2 to Tesla for three years now. I think GM is passing us now, which is good for them, but I think we have three models, they have like 12 models,” Farley said. “So I would hope based on their investment that they would start to really accelerate that.”

A step forward, then a step back

Still, a smaller-than-predicted EV market has caused the company to make several expensive decisions to align operations with realistic vehicle sales. GM has made numerous production changes this year that reversed work that cost the company years and billions in investment converting plants to produce electric vehicles and left UAW workers in a state of confusion.

GM has slashed shifts and laid off hundreds of workers at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit-Hamtramck where it invested $2.2 billion to produce the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV; Chevrolet Silverado EV; GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ. Those workers will remain on layoff for the rest of the year, GM confirmed Oct. 9.

Late last month, GM changed the status of 900 workers on temporary layoff to “indefinite” layoff at the Fairfax Assembly plant in Kanas City, Kansas, while it retools the plant for production of the gas-powered Equinox.

Dontay Wilson, president of UAW Local 31, referred to the displacement of those workers as “not an ideal situation.”

“I understand the business is the business, but it would have been great to maintain some security for these folks for the foreseeable future,” he told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network. “The GM Fairfax local management team has done a decent job, but from a top-down approach, it has been surprising at times. For us, we have been doing the best we can to roll with the punches.”

GM said in April that the Toledo (Ohio) Propulsions Systems plant, which produces transmissions for the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, would increase output as it reduces electric drive unit production.

But last month, as a local television station first reported, GM told workers that it would remove the equipment to even produce electric drive units at the site, the local union leader confirmed to the Detroit Free Press — equipment GM said it spent $760 million in 2022 to install.

Toledo Propulsion Systems was GM’s first U.S. powertrain or propulsion-related factory transformed for EV-related production.

About 1,520 GM employees work at the plant, according to the company’s website. Though no plant jobs were lost, just reallocated, the move still came as a blow, according to UAW Local 14 President Tony Totty.

“Just a couple of months ago, we had an EV ride and drive, and our members were excited,” Totty said in an Oct. 2 interview. “This is a punch to the gut. Our members were excited to make these things.”

Those electric drivetrains were destined for GM’s Orion Assembly Plant, for which GM received $480 million in grant funds from the state of Michigan to expand for electric vehicle production. On July 15, the company solidified plans to produce the Cadillac Escalade, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups there.

For buyers, extra money dries up

GM’s strategy of crafting electrified options for its most popular models like the Chevrolet Blazer, Equinox and Silverado directly addressed what consumers wanted from the automaker’s emerging offerings, said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds' consumer insights analyst.

“Any flavor of EV that they want, you can get it at GM,” he said. “When you have that much choice in your lineup, it becomes easier to move customers into electric.”

No matter how desirable the product, hefty price tags and a lack of charging infrastructure present a challenge for dealers when pitching the vehicles to their customers.

The EV tax credit has been in place since 2008, so James Fackler, executive vice president of the Michigan Auto Dealers Association, said he understands why GM would want to continue the support consumers expect in showrooms.

“I can see the concern that these sales will dry up. People expect this money, and if it’s not there, will they continue to come?” he said. “There are many dealers that support the EV model. Like every salesperson, they want to give the customer what the customer wants, to check every box. A vehicle is a very expensive purchase, even used.”

What the future holds

When GM promised the delivery of an all-electric vehicle portfolio, it envisioned a market capable of supporting those sales. Since that has not come to pass, the company is looking to protect the sale of vehicles that it knows will be profitable — internal combustion vehicles.

So GM has supported the Trump administration's efforts to defang clean air regulation. One example is when GM applauded the Trump administration when it signed a congressional resolution in June reversing a waiver California and other states had been granted that would let them ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.

GM and other automakers have long argued that California and the other states should not have been allowed to do that, effectively getting to decide what kind of cars and trucks they have to make for the whole country.

The White House shared what General Motors said after reversing the waiver: ""We appreciate the actions taken by President Trump to sign (the resolution) into law and help align emissions standards with today’s market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist and senior director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, also noted the industry welcomed Trump’s interventions in the industry surrounding clean air.

“In terms of the vehicle market, this may be a blessing in disguise for automakers by having fewer sticks swung at them in terms of EV mandates — they will be freed up in the longer term to produce the vehicles people want and can afford,” Chesbrough said.

“Everybody is in shock right now trying to figure out what is the best strategy going forward,” he said. “The bigger danger for the Detroit Three is they’re no longer global manufacturers, they’ve been chased back to North America and China seems to be ... quickly moving people onto their (battery electric vehicles). Will we be able to make a competitive electric product, or will this be something we have ceded to the Chinese market?”

'No need' for discounting

With GM facing increased tariff costs and stripped of government tax incentives, Aldred’s goal to maintain EV sales momentum without excessive discounting is ambitious.

Despite those challenges, Aldred said he plans to hold firm to GM’s playbook that allowed the company to gain market share even when the competition accelerated incentives, or discounts. Earlier this year, several automakers adjusted pricing strategies ahead of Trump's first round of tariffs on foreign-made vehicles and parts. GM was the only Detroit-based automaker that did not run any ads about its U.S. commitment or lowering costs.

Also GM on Oct. 9 showed off its newest EV, a new Chevrolet Bolt, the automaker's most affordable electric vehicle, and said it plans to begin shipping them to dealerships in January. But the Detroit automaker said the vehicle would sell for only a “limited run” and would not clarify to reporters what that meant.

Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis for AutoPacific, said bringing back the Bolt corrected one of Mary Barra's rare missteps ― retiring the most attainable long-range EV just as affordability became the biggest barrier to selling electric cars.

“There's still a chicken-and-egg dilemma: Affordable EVs need volume to survive, but volume won't come without affordable EVs,” Waatti said. “GM, perhaps more than any other automaker, is uniquely positioned to tackle that tension with its strong ICE portfolio that gives it the flexibility to support EV accessibility ― even if that means at a loss ― while its long-term EV strategy takes shape.”

Though GM will remain “competitive” with its incentives moving forward, the company’s plan, Aldred said, is to more or less let the vehicles speak for themselves.

One method? Maintaining low inventory levels of desirable products to bolster dealership profitability, which in turn ensures the automaker doesn't require high incentives to sell cars.

“We won't be changing that formula. Going into next year, we started off looking at the industry ... what might happen, what will the other brands do, what will the incentive landscape be?” Aldred said. “In the end, we kind of said, 'Well, let's just look at ourselves.' Because really, what the adoption is and what other people do is somewhat irrelevant. We've got an outstanding portfolio of EVs as well as (internal combustion engine vehicles), and we believe we can sell a volume of those irrespective of what's going to happen in the bigger marketplace.”

It may be the best part of 2,500 years since the Athenian playwright wrote those words, but as human society embarks on arguably the most challenging and consequential economic transition in history - the green industrial revolution - they are as pertinent as ever.

The route to future prosperity is increasingly obvious. McKinsey has estimated the global market opportunity presented by the net zero transition could be worth more than £1tr for UK companies by 2030. By the same date, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), has estimated the pursuit of net zero could deliver a net increase in jobs of up to 725,000 across the UK economy. And, within 20 years, it projects the path to net zero could drive down average household energy and motoring costs by up to £1,400 a year. All that, before you consider how a net zero economy should help safeguard the only habitable planet in the known universe from ecosystem collapse, and in doing dampen the risk of the spiralling inflation, infrastructure damage, and healthcare costs that would come with runaway climate change.

There may still be politicians who seek to argue otherwise, framing climate change as a ""con"" and net zero as a costly endeavour that risks destroying industry and forcing businesses and jobs abroad. Just last week Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed, without evidence, that the UK's net zero targets were ""destroying more jobs than they are creating"" as she called for the Climate Change Act and net zero targets to be scrapped.

But such claims rarely survive contact with reality. The CBI estimates that, already today, there are around 22,000 net zero businesses - spanning range of sectors from renewable energy to green finance - employing some one million people in the UK. These companies and the jobs they provide are rapidly growing, too: last year these industries grew 10 per cent - three times faster than the rest of the economy - while generating £83bn in gross value added (GVA). Moreover, they offer better paid jobs with annual average salaries £5,600 above the average UK wage, at £43,000 a year.

Make no mistake, the signals of green prosperity are already emerging in the UK. Yet as Sophocles reminds us, none of the opportunities on offer can be grasped without painstaking work - and, crucially, a workforce with the right skills and talent to deliver the infrastructure and reforms that are so urgently needed.

And there's the rub. It is well documented that the path towards a cleaner, greener, resilient, and more prosperous future presents huge engineering, financial, and policy challenges. But the net zero transition is as much a skills challenge as anything else. And it is this very human question of how to develop the skills and build the workforce required to build a net zero economy that is at risk of being dangerously overlooked.

Indeed, as the UK charts its course towards a cleaner, more prosperous future, much of the current and projected workforce is ill prepared for the journey. There are skills shortages emerging across multiple green sectors, and the pipeline of school leavers or people switching careers, including those from carbon intensive industries, is struggling to fill the gaps.

Recent research by Green Alliance has warned the UK faces a widening green skills gap across every major sector of the economy, highlighting housing, transport, and land-use as facing the most immediate shortages. The UK is crying out for more heat pump engineers, sustainable packaging designers, and carbon accountants, yet these are still seen as relatively niche skills, rather than the bread and butter of tomorrow's economy that they are soon to become.

Meanwhile, a recent study by recruitment website Indeed found more than a quarter of UK firms are facing challenges when it comes to recruiting for sustainability-related jobs, while almost half of jobseekers admit they lack the necessary qualifications or experience for working in the green economy. The situation is even more stark for young people, with recent LinkedIn data showing just one in 20 people in the 18-24 age bracket believe they have the green skills needed to enter jobs supporting the net zero transition. In the clean energy sector alone, PwC estimated that the UK may soon face a green skills gap of 200,000 jobs.

For its part, the government is preparing to launch a new Clean Energy Jobs plan to support its recently announced push to double the number of roles in the sector to 830,000 by 2030. But delivering on that target will require a huge increase in the UK's science, technology, maths, and engineering (STEM) skills base, especially given the challenges of an ageing existing workforce and the way many other industries and countries are clamouring for the same skills required by clean energy developers.

Clearly, if the UK's net zero transition comes unstuck, it will not be for a lack of job opportunities - rather, it will be the lack of trained people to do them. And this is where the bad-faith arguments of net zero sceptics risk finding leverage: because it is all very well and good creating industries capable of supporting hundreds of thousands if not millions of new job opportunities in the burgeoning net zero economy, if British workers do not have the skills or experience to fill those roles, or the support and confidence to change career.

Get it wrong, and young people seeking rewarding career opportunities and communities reliant on declining high carbon industries will once again suffer. It is easy to see how under such a scenario it would be easier to blame clean technologies and a net zero transition that failed to deliver on their promise than the failure to deliver the training opportunities that would make new green jobs a possibility. Net zero naysayers' doom-laden prophecies of de-industrialisation and jobs being exported abroad risk being proved at last partially accurate, creating the conditions for an even more intense political backlash against climate action.

To head off this risk it is vital the net zero transition delivers the jobs it has promised - and that those jobs are well paid and rewarding. Diversity and equality of opportunity matters, too, because as Climate Change Committee CEO Emma Pinchbeck argued last week, DEI isn't just ""tokenistic"" but intrinsic to designing and delivering a future that works for - and gets the most out of - everyone. ""If you want to build a future, you need everyone in the room to design that future,"" she said.

None of this will be easy. The competition for green skills is intensifying at breakneck speed. Almost every major economy in the world is now jostling for a leading role in burgeoning clean technology race, with China already streets ahead. The workers with the ability to manufacture and install heat pumps or build genuinely sustainable business models will be in hot demand.

Meanwhile, this demand will have to be met against the backdrop of the UK's ageing population, tightening restrictions on immigration, perennial challenges in developing the STEM skills base, a university funding crisis, and a fractious political battle over the UK's net zero targets. The changing labour market will also have to navigate the political, economic, and social fallout from the inevitable contraction of carbon intensive industries and the need to re-train workers to support the roll out of new clean technologies.

However, where there is challenge, there is also opportunity. The good news is every new job supported by the burgeoning green economy creates another strong advocate in their community for the transition ahead, and real world evidence of how these jobs can be hugely rewarding. There is a reason why, even despite the climate-denial and 'war' on clean energy touted by the Party's leaders Nigel Farage and Richard Tice, even some Reform UK-led councils are standing up for clean energy policies and industries: political decisions that destroy employment do not tend to be hugely popular with voters.

Every green job should be seen as a blow to scepticism and kamikaze 'business as usual' economics that are sure to feature heavily in the run up to the next election, which is now almost certain to be a de-facto referendum on net zero.

There is also a growing understanding of how to build out the green skills base, of the skills that are needed, the training and recruitment strategies that work, and the messaging that can attract more people to what is a hugely exciting and vibrant sector.

All of which is why BusinessGreen is today launching Workforce 2030, a brand-new campaign that aims to raise awareness of the looming skills crunch facing industries right across the green economy, and help advance solutions to ensure the promised employment opportunities and benefits are both capitalised on and widely shared.

Through dedicated news, analysis, case studies, and input from an array of expert voices, the campaign aims to bang the drum for ambitious policies, funding, training, and education at local, national, and corporate levels to equip the workforce of both today and tomorrow with the critical skills needed to further advance the green industrial revolution.

We therefore invite businesses, politicians, academics, think tanks, and all those working in the green economy or interested in doing so to join us in promoting the campaign and the workforce that will be needed for 2030 - because without labour, nothing prospers.

The collaborations enable hundreds of new charging stations across the US to accept payments from WEX users and provide WEX customers with access to an extensive EV charging network.

WEX EV’s charging network is part of a suite of commercial charging solutions designed specifically for mixed-energy fleets. The WEX EV En Route solution gives drivers access to a network of over 150,000 public charging ports across the US including EVgo, Blink Charging, EV Connect, ChargePoint, FLO, AmpUp, EvGateway, Noodoe and more. Drivers can access the charging stations via the DriverDash mobile app or a universal WEX EV RFID card under a secure closed-loop payment system.

The partnership deals follow the introduction of WEX EV Depot in April 2025, which provides simple and secure charging at private chargers when using the WEX fleet card. The company already offers its public charging En Route and At-Home solutions, and it now supports EV charging payments across depot, public and at-home charging locations.

Energy infrastructure development company Lynkwell’s WEX integration allows it to provide WEX corporate-grade payment capabilities across its multitude of station networks. Its cloud-based EV charging software platform hosts dozens of EV charging networks and manages 10,000 assets.

Revel has evolved from an electric moped-sharing and ride-hail startup into a provider of urban-focused public EV fast-charging infrastructure, particularly in dense cities like New York and San Francisco. The company operates multiple DC fast charging superhubs offering 150 kW to 320 kW ports that serve all makes of EVs.

Working with WEX allows Revel to extend the reach and convenience of its fast-charging superhubs to more fleet operators, the company said. By integrating WEX’s payment technology into its network, Revel aims to make it easier for commercial drivers to access charging in dense cities while giving fleet managers transparency and control over transactions.

Ampcontrol’s AI-powered software and energy management platform is designed to help EV fleet operators and charging hubs optimize and streamline their charging infrastructure. It connects all energy assets, EV chargers and vehicles to help customers like Revel manage load and reduce energy and peak-demand costs.

“Bringing a diverse range of CPOs into the WEX EV network marks a major step forward for fleet operators nationwide,” said Carlos Carriedo, Chief Operating Officer, Americas Payments & Mobility at WEX. “By integrating our payment processing technology and syncing transaction details and RFID numbers from charging stations across multiple providers, we’re streamlining the EV charging experience and giving organizations the data they need to make smarter, more strategic operational decisions.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_605131763.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 11:02:42.180564

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25283205200805.fQlPfEfZ7p.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.52&fp-y=0.13&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-13 11:01:55.671629

Much of the increased power requirement stems from new data center and AI infrastructure, according to Duke. “Regulators have made clear that replacement generation must be online and serving customers before additional coal units can retire,” company spokesman Bill Norton said.

In the plan, Duke said that due to “increasing challenges” in maintaining grid stability, the plants would have to be extended. The utility had aimed to retire all of its remaining coal plants by 2035. The plants slated for extension include the 2.24GW Belews Creek facility in Stokes County, North Carolina, which could continue operations until 2040.

Following this, the utility has said it intends to deploy small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) at former coal sites, targeting deployment by 2037.

Alongside delayed coal retirements, Duke intends to expand its natural gas fleet, requiring more than 100 miles of new pipeline infrastructure across North Carolina. While thermal generation has received a boost, the utility also reported its intention to scale back renewable targets, with projected solar additions dropping from 8.2GW by 2031 to 7.9GW by 2033, while onshore and offshore wind, which was previously forecast to add 3.6GW within ten years, has now been excluded until at least 2040.

The updated roadmap closely follows notable changes in state and federal energy policy. Last month, the US Department of Energy indicated that it was prepared to utilize emergency powers to extend the lifespan of coal-fired power plants.

The statements are a continuation of a pro-coal policy first announced by President Trump in April, when he signed a series of executive orders to “reinvigorate” the country’s coal sector to meet the surging energy demand of AI data centers.

The orders included edicts to “remove federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that Federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation.”

Several utilities have already extended the life of coal-fired plants this year, citing data center demand as a major driver. A recent example is Southern Company, which in February announced its intention to extend the life of three plants with a combined capacity of 8.2GW from 2028 to 2035.

Duke Energy is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and owns 54.8GW of baseload and peak generation in the US.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase launched a $1.5 trillion plan on Monday to facilitate, finance and invest in industries deemed critical to the U.S. national security and economic resilience, including defense, energy and advanced manufacturing.

As part of the 10-year initiative, the largest U.S. lender also plans to hire more bankers and invest up to $10 billion into U.S. companies through direct equity and venture capital investments, focusing on fast-growing businesses and key manufacturers.

The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration looks to modernize infrastructure and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, clean energy and rare earths.

“It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said.

Trump revived the trade war against Beijing on Friday, ending an uneasy truce between the two largest economies with promises to sharply hike tariffs in a reprisal against China curbing its rare earths exports.

JPMorgan said its new “security and resiliency initiative” would facilitate financing and investment across four strategic sectors: supply chain and manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence; and frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

The firm said it had already planned to facilitate and finance about $1 trillion over the next decade in support of clients in these important industries, according to previously undisclosed internal figures, but it would be increasing the size by 50%.

The U.S. government is pursuing deals across up to 30 industries, involving dozens of companies deemed critical to national or economic security, Reuters reported this month.

JPMorgan, which helped put together the government’s deal with U.S. rare earths mining company MP Materials, said in a recent company podcast that the bank was working with the Trump administration to explore more such opportunities.

“We’ve had no less than 100 calls with clients to talk about the MP transaction as well as what this means for other industries,” said Andrew Castaldo, JPMorgan’s co-head of mid-cap mergers and acquisitions. “And we’ve had numerous trips down to Washington to explore those opportunities with the government.”

Dimon also emphasized the need for policy reform to accelerate progress, citing regulatory delays and workforce challenges.

“America needs more speed and investment,” he said.

KEY INVESTMENT AREAS

The four key investment areas identified by the firm have been divided into 27 sub-sectors ranging from shipbuilding and nuclear energy to nanomaterials and secure communications and will include middle-market companies as well as large corporate clients, it added.

The bank said it would establish an external advisory council composed of public and private sector leaders, in addition to hiring more bankers and investment professionals.

It will also expand thematic research on supply chain vulnerabilities and emerging technologies, leveraging its recently launched Center for Geopolitics.

AI and energy security are key tailwinds for cleaner power

Multi-speed transition is playing out, but the long-term trend is unchanged to deploy $150trn in green technologies

The global megatrends of electrification and energy security are persuading investors in the green transition to look past short-term headwinds when allocating capital, according to senior executives at Nomura Greentech’s Sustainable Leaders Summit in Salzburg, Austria.

About $150 trillion of capital is required by 2050 to fund the global energy transition and despite recent inflationary challenges and slower progress from countries such as the US, there is a great deal of optimism about investing into green technologies.

While the cost of capital for renewables has reset at a higher level amid inflationary forces – a 200bps rise since 2021 with most of that increase coming since the third quarter of 2022 – executives viewed this as a sign that speculative capital is making way for long-term investors who see the inevitability of transitioning to sustainable energy systems.

There are reasons for optimism in all major markets including Europe, China and the US.

EUROPE – ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

Europe is committed to eliminating its dependence on Russian gas via its REPowerEU plan, which is accelerating the region’s decarbonization ambitions. Imports of Russian gas dropped from 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to 52 bcm in 2024 – with the overall share of Russian gas imports falling from 45% to 19%, according to the European Commission. This intensifying focus on energy security means that the bloc continues to roll out renewable energy more quickly, with almost half (47%) of electricity in the EU now coming from renewables. Installed wind and solar capacity has increased by 58% cumulatively between 2021 and 2024.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also caused wider tremors among neighbouring countries, prompting them to prioritise defence spending in order to become more self-reliant in the event of a wider conflict. Germany has announced plans to nearly double its defence budget to €650 billion ($764 billion) over the next five years. Companies such as Fernride have spotted a trillion-dollar opportunity to create regional champions in the sphere of automated armoured vehicles in combat zones, at ports and for freight logistics on public roads. Fernride’s AI-based human-in-the-loop technology means that one driver can operate up to 50 trucks remotely to address massive shortages of commercial drivers (400k) and trained soldiers (300k).

Europe has also made considerable progress on installing electric vehicle (EV) chargers. Take Germany, - the bloc’s biggest country - where more than 145k public charge points have been installed and a forecasted slowdown in EV car sales has not materialised.

EUROPE – REGULATORY LEADER

Europe has also used its strength in regulation to encourage the adoption of green technologies across multiple sectors as illustrated by ReFuel EU, which aims to boost the supply and demand of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by increasing SAF and eSAF mandates over time. SAF is derived from hydrotreated esters and acids while eSAF is a synthetic fuel drives from renewable energy such as solar, hydro or wind.

The FuelEU Maritime Mandate is another example of EU regulation taking a leadership role to drive change. The rules set increasingly strict limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, aiming for an 80% reduction by 2050 for commercial vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports. The International Maritime Organization created its own net zero framework earlier this year encompassing a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions.

In stark contrast to these sectors and to emphasise the powerful impact of effective regulation, summit participants cited the petrochemicals industry where regulatory drivers and subsidies are in short supply. Entrenched interests are high, and an oversupply of conventional petrochemicals is keeping prices low, meaning alternatives that carry a green premium struggle to compete with incumbents selling cheaper, higher-emission products.

CHINA – A LOW CARBON INDUSTRIAL CHAMPION

China’s decades-long investment into photovoltaic (PV) technology has paved the way for more affordable solar power across the globe. China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%, more than double China’s share of global PV demand, according to the International Energy Agency.

As a result, the levelized cost of PV solar power – which includes the cost of building the plant – has declined by 88% over the past 15 years; removing green premiums has been key to mass adoption.

In addition, China’s rapid rollout of battery technology for EVs has accelerated adoption at home and abroad.

The chart below shows that more than half of China’s vehicles will be electric by 2030.

US – MARKET FORCES DRIVE CAPACITY UPGRADES

While the US renewables market is contending with political headwinds arising from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and tariffs on imports of PV panels, aging grid infrastructure and greater power demand from investments in AI data centers could offset these negative effects.

The OBBBA reduces Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar but preserves full credits for energy storage and clean firm technologies through 2033. Tariff escalations and geopolitical tensions have intensified supply chain challenges, but as a result, a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing and alternative sourcing has emerged, even across hard to decouple supply chains such as critical components for batteries and PV modules.

High growth in the US power market is projected over the next 15 years as demand continues to outpace supply due to significant growth in sectors requiring near-term power. Over the last two decades, improved energy efficiency for lighting, appliances and heating and cooling meant that the compound annual growth rate for energy demand was about 0.4% per year but the new era of AI, EV penetration and electrification of everything is set to substantially increase demand to 3.5% per year until 2040, according to McKinsey data.

Historically, energy has not been a constraint on computing; even as higher internet traffic increased data center workloads by nine times between 2010-2020, overall energy use stayed flat because of more and more efficient chips. But the AI era is set to turn that paradigm on its head, leading to a 17-64GW shortfall in peak power demand by 2030, which will likely require fast-built solar and battery storage to fill the gap.

Every US region is in need of energy infrastructure upgrades and replacements to minimize impacts of congestion and increase reliability. All three major components of the electric grid - generation, transmission and distribution - have an identified investment gap, which is projected to grow to a cumulative $197 billion by 2029, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in existing energy infrastructure. The US utility industry expects to see about a ~1.6x increase in capital expenditures into critical infrastructure over the period of 2026-2030 representing $1.3 trillion in capex from 2026-2030.

In short, executives increasingly see a-multi-speed transition playing out with China using its industrial scale to take the lead on renewables and EVs while Europe uses the stick of regulation and energy independence to advance the green transition. The US faces short term challenges, yet it has already laid strong foundations to build resilient systems for an electrified, digital future.

“For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said.
“Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.” The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023.
Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp.
He said it was “looking at a range of post-2030 settings” but had no plans to include electricity in the safeguard mechanism.","Australian household energy bills will halve by 2050 as solar panels, batteries and electric cars and appliances become the norm, reducing pressure on the federal government over living costs and creating room for more climate action, a thinktank study suggests.

Modelling by the Grattan Institute finds that cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in line with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will cut average household energy costs from about $5,800 today to about $3,000.

The report says a fall of roughly this magnitude will happen under existing policies as households use less gas and petrol and more clean energy. The biggest savings are expected in gas-reliant Victoria, where the modelling suggests average annual spending on petrol, gas and electricity could fall from $6,036 to $2,767.

The report says emission cuts in the power sector are not happening fast enough and the mid-century net zero target will not be met without a policy requiring cuts in pollution from electricity.

The Grattan Institute has called on the government to consider expanding a policy applied to major industrial polluting sites – the safeguard mechanism – to include power plants. It says this would limit household energy savings compared with what would otherwise happen, but only marginally – by about 3%.

It says the safeguard mechanism is already a form of carbon pricing – language the Labor government has avoided since it lost a fraught political fight that culminated with the Coalition government under Tony Abbott abolishing a functioning carbon pricing scheme in 2014. The institute’s energy and climate change program director, Alison Reeve, said how people use energy has changed since then “and the politics of carbon pricing should change too”.

“For too long, federal governments of both political colours have avoided pricing carbon because they fear higher electricity prices,” Reeve said. “Our report shows that the source of that fear is becoming outdated.”

The Coalition introduced the safeguard mechanism and Labor revamped it in 2023. It requires about 200 industrial facilities that release more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in Australia each year – including liquified natural gas plants, coalmines, smelters and factories – to reduce emission intensity by 4.9% each year until 2030.

The cuts can be made either on site or by buying carbon offsets. Companies that reduce emissions below a baseline level are also given “safeguard mechanism credits” that they can sell to polluters that do not meet their baseline.

Government data suggests the total direct pollution from facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism fell by nearly 2% in the first year after Labor’s revamp. But the scheme has been criticised for allowing unlimited use of offsets despite peer-reviewed studies suggesting they are failing to deliver what was promised.

A review of the safeguard mechanism is planned next year.

Reeve said the institute’s modelling assumed electricity companies would make direct emission cuts, and could not rely Australian carbon credits created through methods including improved nature cover.

She said a “pure” carbon tax or emissions trading scheme would be better than current policies, including the safeguard mechanism – a point also made by the longtime Labor climate and economics adviser Ross Garnaut – but Grattan had focused on what was politically achievable.

“Neither of those horses are in the race at the moment,” she said. “You can only bet on the horses that are in the race.”

Labor has faced criticism for delays in the rollout of solar and windfarms needed to meet its target of 82% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030.

Renewable energy in homes has boomed since the introduction of a battery subsidy in July. But investment in large-scale developments – particularly windfarms – has slowed, in part due to delays in planning approvals, construction of transmission links and supply chains.

The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government was focused on delivering existing policies, including an underwriting program for large solar, wind and battery developments (known as the capacity investment scheme), the $20bn “rewiring the nation” program and the battery subsidy. He said it was “looking at a range of post-2030 settings” but had no plans to include electricity in the safeguard mechanism.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f28f6c98b3b9e387536c678228873ddc263ea5/1582_0_4418_3534/master/4418.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eeb04b20ccc4fd41e56d2cbccd22c3d4",N,,2025-10-13 09:58:21.310306

Outlook: Stability Through Strategic Execution If successful, Hut 8’s transformation could make it one of North America’s most formidable independent data-center operators, leveraging its legacy energy expertise to supply the AI economy.","Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ: HUT) emerged as one of Canada’s largest Bitcoin miners, but over the past two years, the Toronto‑listed (TSX) firm has been quietly reinventing itself as a diversified energy-infrastructure company.

Chief executive Asher Genoot argues that this “power‑first” model unlocks cheaper financing and steady cash flows by leasing capacity to both crypto miners and HPC users.

The question for investors is whether this pivot is paying off.

Expanding a Digital Infrastructure Empire

Hut 8 has been busy building. In August the company advanced 1.53 gigawatts (GW) of U.S. development projects out of exclusivity and into construction. The company’s assets include a 300 megawatt (MW) “River Bend” campus in Louisiana, a 1 GW site and a 180 MW site in Texas, and a 50 MW facility in Illinois.

Genoot says commercialization of these sites would “double” the company’s scale and push its platform above 2.55 GW of capacity across 19 sites.

Hut 8 reported Q2 2025 revenue of $41.3 million and net income of $137.5 million. The company now manages more than 1,020 MW of power capacity with another 10.8 GW in early-stage development — effectively recasting itself from a crypto miner into a digital-infrastructure developer.

Wall Street’s Take on Hut 8’s Transformation

The pivot has drawn measured approval from Wall Street analysts. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer raised his HUT price target to $36 per share (from $33) in July, citing Hut 8’s plan to double managed power capacity to 2.55 GW and its $2.4 billion liquidity. Piper Sandler and Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage with overweight ratings and targets around $33–$35, praising the energy asset portfolio and partnerships with chip‑maker Bitmain. These numbers are already out of date as Hut 8’s stock price closed above $43 last week.

Roth Capital went further, boosting HUT’s target to $60, arguing that leasing long‑term power contracts to hyperscale customers could re‑rate Hut 8 as a data‑center operator rather than a crypto miner. On average, analysts tracked by AInvest assign a “Buy” rating with a $27.82 target, even after a late‑September selloff knocked HUT shares down 7 percent. Again, the price has recovered dramatically since this price prediction.

Institutional ownership has climbed from roughly 12 percent to 55 percent since early 2025.

Still, there are a couple of reasons for caution.

Challenges: Capital, Execution, and Environmental Pushback

Enthusiasm is tempered by concerns about capital intensity and execution risk. Benchmark’s Palmer noted that while Hut 8’s balance-sheet liquidity stands near $2.4 billion, its ambitions require multi-year financing and regulatory coordination across several states — a test few miners-turned-infrastructure firms have passed.

To add, Hut 8’s proposed facilities in Louisiana and Illinois have already drawn scrutiny from local communities over water usage and electricity demand. Environmental groups in Louisiana warn that massive AI data centers could “damage our already bleak living situations and environment.” Analysts also caution that rising electricity prices and tight labor markets could delay commissioning schedules and erode expected margins.

Financially, Hut 8’s earnings remain volatile. The firm’s Q1 2025 net loss of $134 million underscored the difficulty of maintaining profitability during the transition away from pure mining. Its “asset-light” approach relies on joint-venture financing — a $200 million revolving credit facility with Two Prime and a $130 million line with Coinbase, boosting liquidity to roughly $2.4 billion when combined with its 10,000+ Bitcoin reserve — and a $1 billion at‑the‑market (ATM) equity offering that some investors view as dilutive.

But beyond the numbers, the pivot raises a broader question: can a company built for volatility master the predictability demanded by infrastructure investors?

Outlook: Stability Through Strategic Execution

If successful, Hut 8’s transformation could make it one of North America’s most formidable independent data-center operators, leveraging its legacy energy expertise to supply the AI economy. Its long-term vision — to monetize power, not coins — aligns with the structural shift toward compute-intensive workloads and decentralized energy assets.

Yet the path forward depends on “flawless execution”: securing energy permits, closing customer contracts, and balancing environmental stewardship with growth — as is the case with IREN, and Riot platforms, Hut 8’s direct competitors. Wall Street’s early optimism suggests belief in that vision — but not blind faith.

As Roth Capital’s Darren Aftahi put it, Hut 8 is evolving from a Bitcoin miner into an energy-driven infrastructure play focused on AI. Whether it can do so profitably will determine if this bold pivot truly earns its Wall Street redemption.

Local business, civic and labor leaders see nuclear energy as the fuel of choice when Xcel Energy stops burning coal at its power plants in Pueblo County,

Is nuclear power becoming cool in Colorado?

The state has had only one nuclear power plant, Fort St. Vrain near Platteville. And it was converted to natural gas in 1989 after 10 years of technical problems. The former Rocky Flats weapons plant, which produced plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs, drew thousands of protesters for years to the site north of Denver, including such prominent activists as Daniel Ellsberg and Beat poet Allen Ginsberg.

In 2004, Colorado voters were the first in the country to approve a renewable energy mandate for utilities. How has nuclear power, with its baggage of radioactive waste and the Three Mile Island partial meltdown, become a seriously considered option in today’s fuel mix?

Worry about the demand for electricity outstripping capacity and concerns about progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions led state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Denver Democrat, to back legislation this year that defines nuclear power as “clean.” He sponsored House Bill 25-1040, which added nuclear to the energy sources that utilities can use to meet state clean energy targets.

“As a kid, I grew up in the ’80s when a lot of talk about nuclear was in relation to the weaponry that was pointed at each other between the Soviet Union and the United States,” Valdez said. “I think I just kind of lumped nuclear into the same conversations as most people do: around its negative uses, less desirable uses.”

Valdez got a different perspective when he was appointed to the nuclear working group at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The group visited France, which gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power. Roughly 19% of electricity in the U.S. comes from nuclear energy.

With some forecasts showing electricity demand rising dramatically, Valdez said the U.S. will have to add “a tremendous amount of energy” to the grid if it’s going to compete in quantum computing and other advanced technology.

A boom in data center construction driven by increasing the use of artificial intelligence is expected to escalate the need for more electricity generation.

Valdez, who spent most of his career in the renewable energy field, said the legislation he sponsored recognizes that the power generated by nuclear energy is carbon-free. “As we move toward our path to zero-carbon (energy), it can be included in the mix to get us there.”

Not ready for prime time

A lot of the current interest in nuclear power revolves around a new technology: small modular nuclear reactors, about one-tenth to one quarter the size of a conventional reactor. They’re billed as potentially less expensive, safer, easier to build and adaptable because modules can be added as more power is needed.

The technology is also still in the development and demonstration stage. Just a few are operating in China and Russia. No small modular reactors –SMRs– are in commercial use in the U.S.

“SMRs aren’t ready for prime time,” said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “You will hear from developers and others about the advantages. The advantages right now are all on paper.”

The institute focuses on research into the economics of expanding the use of renewable energy.

“We are not fans of nuclear power because it costs too much and that cost has been consistently high over the years. We see no track record of it declining,” Wamsted said. “We certainly don’t see that happening with a new class of reactor that nobody’s built before and nobody’s run before.”

Noah Rott, a spokesman for the western region of the Sierra Club, said the environmental group feels that discussion around nuclear energy “is largely a distraction as utilities work to address electric load growth in the next decade.”

“Cleaner sources like wind, solar, demand response, energy efficiency and storage are the answer here,” Rott said in an email.

However, the concept of an energy source that can run 24/7 and emit no heat-trapping greenhouse gases when generating power is compelling. Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in August that the airport, the country’s third-busiest, planned to commission a study to explore the feasibility of building a small, modular nuclear reactor on its campus to meet the growing demand for electricity in the area and cut the use of carbon-emitting power.

The airport put the study on hold after complaints that city officials hadn’t talked to area residents first. The airport determined that a broader scope will best serve its interests and needs and will issue a request for information later this fall on multiple clean energy solutions, including reactors, after first receiving ideas and input from the community, spokeswoman Courtney Law said in an email Wednesday.

Nuclear power generation is the top choice of a local advisory committee for replacing coal at Xcel Energy’s Comanche power plants near Pueblo. Xcel has proposed tapping renewable energy, battery storage and natural gas when it stops burning coal by 2031.

But the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, established by Xcel and community members, said renewable energy facilities wouldn’t provide the same number of jobs and tax revenue for local governments that nuclear or gas facilities would. The committee is promoting installing SMRs.

Xcel Energy operates nuclear facilities in Minnesota and has said they’re not off the table for Colorado, but the new type of reactors likely won’t be commercially available when the utility has to replace its coal plants.

The Western Governors Association, WGA, held workshops in September at the Idaho National Laboratory, which focuses largely on nuclear energy.

The workshops were part of an initiative by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West.” Cox, the WGA’s chairman this year, said the country is looking to the West for ways to meet the surge in need for more electricity.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little said during a workshop that the U.S. won’t meet its energy needs “with our legacy energy.”

“We’re going to have to have scalable, safe nuclear energy,” Little said.

While it could be five to 10 years before small reactors are up and running in the U.S., Mark Jensen, a chemistry professor at the Colorado School of Mines, said the federal government is more involved in promoting nuclear energy than in the recent past. He noted that the Department of Energy has opened federal sites to allow companies to test prototypes and that could help streamline development.

President Donald Trump has issued executive orders intended to invigorate the nuclear power industry and streamline regulations.

Jensen, director of the nuclear science and engineering program at the School of Mines, said more private money is flowing into nuclear projects than he has seen over the past 35 years.

Wind, solar the ‘workhorses’

Jack Waldorf, WGA executive director, said in an email that advancements in nuclear energy provide the opportunity to expand clean, reliable generation of electricity, but achieving true energy abundance will require a comprehensive approach.

Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that Colorado has a history as an innovator and nuclear energy should be no different. ” As projects become cost competitive and safer, we should view nuclear energy not as a competing energy source to wind and solar, but as a complementary solution for better overall reliability and lower costs.”

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, agreed. He said as Colorado moves to more deeply cut emissions, other technologies will be needed and nuclear energy should certainly be in the mix.

“It’s pretty clear that wind and solar will be the workhorses of the grid just looking at the cost modeling,” Toor said. “You can build them relatively quickly and they’re so much cheaper than other resources.”

He expects nuclear power to be in a group of what he calls “clean, firm” energy sources: ones that emit low or no greenhouse gases and provide round-the-clock power. Toor said geothermal energy is likely the furthest along among those sources.

“The challenge with nuclear is really still the same challenge that it has been for utilities, which is the cost, how long it takes to build and the uncertainties of federal permitting,” Toor said.

He added that he would be surprised if Colorado utilities moved ahead with conventional nuclear or “to be first in line for the first-of-its-kind” small modular reactor.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TDP-L-img1332A_115195150.jpg?w=1024&h=717,N,,2025-10-13 11:02:04.921995

Donald Trump pledged to push for “American energy dominance” throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, powered by an aggressive expansion of domestic fossil fuel production. He kept that promise in his second administration while also eliminating billions of dollars in federal support for clean energy projects.

That hasn’t been good for Americans’ pocketbooks, though. Sure, a gallon of gasoline is slightly cheaper than a year ago, but that’s more than offset by higher electric power costs, with utility rates rising more than twice as fast as overall inflation. And it turns out that global demand for U.S. oil, gas and coal isn’t keeping up with worldwide sales of Chinese green energy technology.

Chinese exports of clean energy-related products this year through July total $120 billion, according to Bloomberg, using data from the U.S. Energy Department, Energy Information Administration, China’s GACC and energy researcher Ember. By comparison, the U.S. exported just $80 billion of carbon-based energy in the same period. It continues a trend seen after China’s clean energy exports totalled $180 billion in 2024, $30 billion more than the $150 billion the U.S. got selling fossil fuels around the world. The gap is likely widening–Chinese clean tech exports were worth $20.3 billion in August alone, according to Ember.

Rapid growth in renewable power demand around the world is easy to explain: it’s cheaper and can be installed faster than traditional sources of electricity. That’s why in the first half of 2025, additions of new solar and wind power were the fastest-growing source of electricity generation, overtaking coal worldwide for the first time. And in that booming market, China is by far the world’s dominant supplier. Unfortunately, Trump’s current policies and reversal of Biden-era programs ensure the U.S. will fall even farther behind.

Those now revoked tax credits helped to kick off a manufacturing boom in America, generating hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. New factories went up all over the country, making batteries, clean vehicles and energy-efficient products for businesses and homeowners. It was also bringing down energy costs for consumers. Now that momentum is reversing.

“In terms of the global arms race for clean energy jobs and investment, the U.S. went from the middle of the pack to the front basically overnight” with the Biden programs that Trump has eliminated, Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement. But the budget bill Republicans passed on a party-line vote and that Trump signed into law this summer reversed that. “Manufacturing projects are being canceled. Jobs are being lost. Utility bills are rising.”

A $250 Million Plan To Pull Lithium For Batteries From The Great Salt Lake

The U.S. could become a major supplier of lithium for batteries in the next few years after the Trump administration took a stake in the developer of a massive mine in Nevada. But Silicon Valley startup Lilac Solutions thinks it’s got a better idea that avoids the higher costs and environmental harms of traditional mining: extract the pricey mineral from briny water at oil fields and sites like the Great Salt Lake in Utah instead of digging it out of the ground.

Oakland-based Lilac, which has been refining its patented ion-exchange technology for lithium extraction since its founding nearly a decade ago, is raising $250 million to build its first commercial processing facility at the Great Salt Lake that could produce 5,000 metric tons of lithium per year by 2028. If all goes well, that’s just the start as the company looks to help energy companies pull lithium out of massive underground brine deposits that are often a byproduct of active oil and gas fields across the U.S., such as the Smackover Formation, the remnant of an ancient sea that stretches from Texas to Florida, according to CEO Raef Sully.

Compared to the amount of lithium that can be pulled from conventional mines, “brine is probably orders of magnitude larger,” Sully told Forbes.

Brine projects in the Smackover region that companies such as Standard Lithium, ExxonMobil and Chevron are developing promise to yield hundreds of thousands of tons of lithium annually. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated in a study last year that there could be up to 19 million tons of lithium in the Smackover in Arkansas alone. “We estimate there is enough dissolved lithium present in that region to replace U.S. imports of lithium and more,” said USGS hydrologist Katherine Knierim, the study’s principal researcher.

Hot Topic

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, co-chair of America Is All In, on state and local efforts to fight climate change

Can you elaborate on what America Is All In is doing as the federal government reverses U.S. climate policy?

First, there's no ifs about it: We're not getting the kind of work at the federal level that we need to protect our health, our wellbeing, our economy. So we are really in what I would call a pickle at this point. But having said that, there are huge opportunities out there and we're going to grab them. [Cleveland] Mayor Bibb is my colleague and so are Governor Newsom and Governor Pritzker. It's about America is all in and damn it, we are all in. This federal government is not going to take away our rights and our ability to have a healthy environment and a strong economy, which is exactly the opposite of what they are doing.

America Is All In is about gathering together our mayors, our elected officials, our colleagues at the community level. It's about bringing people together with hope and opportunity. It's about forgetting what's going on in the federal government and actually doing what's right for all of us.

It's a great opportunity now. We're growing this initiative. America Is All In is really going to be about how we once again grab the opportunity of our lifetime and move forward. Regardless of what the federal government is thinking about or wants to do, we are going to take it over. We are going to work hard at the subnational level. We're going to work hard at the community level. And we're going to start building the kind of future our kids deserve. That's what America Is All In is about.

Are there some specific programs right now that you’re focused on?

We want to make sure that the Inflation Reduction Act continues to provide progress for us. One of the interesting things about it is not just that America Is All In is working domestically, but we're going to work internationally as well. Part of this is making sure people understand that we still have opportunities ahead and we have to grab those. We've lost a lot in the Inflation Reduction Act, but honestly, we have to move beyond that and understand the power of individuals and communities in this space. It's enormously important for us to have an international presence. If this president isn't interested in positioning us in a way that's going to keep us safe and healthy, then we have to do it ourselves. We just need to move forward. And the exciting thing is that we're not just expanding domestically, but internationally. We are going to be [at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference] in Belém, [Brazil].

We are going to go beyond the United States of America so that people everywhere can see us again–so they don't just look at the Trump administration–but they look at the people in the United States and recognize that we are going to keep moving forward.

There are many opportunities that we have and I think you know them and certainly Mayor Bibb knows, but there are damages that we can't avoid. We have an administration that doesn't want to agree that climate change even exists. They're cutting out our scientists at the federal level, so they can't tell the truth about what's going on in the world. And this can go on and on and on and on. But the thing that I wake up every morning and say to myself is we can't let these people take away our sense of hope and opportunity. That's exactly what they want. They want us to get so angry that you're sitting around in a dither.

But I ain't dithering around, baby. We just have to get hold of ourselves. Really, we own this place. It's our country. So I'm excited about it and there's so many things that we're going to do both domestically and internationally that are going to remind people that we have the power. It is ours to use and we're just going to go after it.

According to figures presented at the annual meeting of the Spanish Energy Club, the country ranks second in Europe for foreign investment and fourth globally in sustainability.

These results reflect growing international confidence in Spain’s regulatory framework, technological diversity and the competitiveness of its electricity system — factors that have positioned it at the heart of Europe’s energy transition.

Spain’s role is further strengthened by a strategy centred on smart grids, energy storage and new industrial capacities linked to hydrogen and digitalisation.

In recent weeks, several public‑private agendas with Asia have underscored this international projection: Galicia completed an official mission to Japan to attract industrial investment; APPA Renovables promoted Spanish participation in the EU Business Hub Japan‑Korea programme and in China’s Battery Tour (13–17 October); and the Basque Hydrogen Corridor continues its collaboration with Japan through Basque Trade & Investment, JETRO and the Energy Cluster, with further joint actions planned for 2025 around hydrogen and its value chain.

As Europe seeks energy autonomy and resilience, the Iberian Peninsula emerges as a key space for green reindustrialisation. Spain and Portugal share a unique advantage: abundant natural resources, mature infrastructure and sustained political will that allow them to accelerate decarbonisation and attract international capital.

The international expansion of Spain’s renewable sector has found in Asia a strategic partner. According to Javier Muñoz, General Director of APPA Renovables, recent trade missions and institutional meetings with Japan, Korea, China and Thailand illustrate an increasingly solid relationship between complementary markets.

“Spain has reached a level of maturity that allows it to share regulatory and technological experience with countries in earlier stages of their energy transition,” Muñoz explained.

In this exchange, Asian countries contribute industrial and technological capacity that strengthens the Spanish value chain, while Spain’s regulatory know‑how and experience in renewable integration consolidate its position as an international benchmark.

Japan and Korea stand out for their expertise in engineering and digital networks; China for its photovoltaic and components industry; and Thailand for its bioenergy development based on agricultural resources. These strengths complement the Spanish ecosystem in fields such as renewable hydrogen, storage and smart‑grid management.

Opportunities and benefits for Spanish industry

The rapprochement with Asia marks a turning point in the internationalisation of Spain’s renewable sector. Muñoz noted that this exchange not only opens new markets but also redefines the industrial scope of clean energy: “We are moving from exporting projects to exporting knowledge. Sharing our regulatory and technical experience positions us as preferred partners in a global context that values stability and innovation.”

Collaborations with Asia aim to strengthen complementary value chains. Speaking to Strategic Energy Europe, the head of APPA Renovables explained that many Spanish companies are joining consortia for offshore wind tenders in Japan and Korea, while others are developing components and smart systems with Asian manufacturers already investing in plants within Spain. “Technology transfer is becoming a two‑way street: they provide industrial capacity, and we contribute design, regulation and integration expertise,” he said.

Within this framework, renewable hydrogen and bioenergy stand out as strategic cooperation axes. Thailand offers opportunities linked to its agricultural base, while Japan and Korea demand solutions for green‑origin certification and advanced logistics — areas where Spanish firms are beginning to excel.

“These alliances not only create contracts and jobs but also reinforce Spain’s image as a country capable of leading energy innovation through international collaboration,” Muñoz concluded.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-18.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:07:45.331319

Both T1 Energy and Talon PV have emerged as major players in the US solar manufacturing industry, leading efforts to produce domestic solar cells alongside firms like ES Foundry and Suniva.
For its part, T1 Energy has inked a “landmark” deal with Michigan-based manufacturing giant Corning to source US-made polysilicon and silicon wafers.
We published a series of interviews with leading figures in the US solar manufacturing industry in recent weeks.","T1 Energy did not disclose the stake it has acquired or the value of its investment. The companies have entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) and “remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future”.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1 Energy’s CEO and chairman of the board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

Both Talon PV and T1 Energy are planning to produce tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells at their respective facilities. The technology has been the subject of much intellectual property litigation in the US, as various companies sought to establish TOPCon production lines.

However, Talon PV has acquired a TOPCon IP portfolio from cadmium telluride (CdTe) module manufacturer First Solar, which it told PV Tech Premium would clear the way for commercial TOPCon cell production in the US. It is unconfirmed whether the two companies plan to share intellectual property after the investment.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of US solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and CEO of Talon.

Both T1 Energy and Talon PV have emerged as major players in the US solar manufacturing industry, leading efforts to produce domestic solar cells alongside firms like ES Foundry and Suniva. The industry has built around 50GW of solar module production capacity, but cells and other upstream components have been far slower to materialise.

For its part, T1 Energy has inked a “landmark” deal with Michigan-based manufacturing giant Corning to source US-made polysilicon and silicon wafers. Combined with its planned cell and module production facilities, the deal would see a fully US-made silicon solar supply chain realised and would mark a significant moment in the country’s PV manufacturing industry.

Pro-Trump solar manufacturers

T1 Energy said both its project and Talon PV’s site are “supported by President Trump’s OBBBA (One Big, Beautiful Bill Act) and 45X tax credits.”

The company, which was formed when it bought Chinese solar manufacturing giant Trina Solar’s US module manufacturing facility last year, has previously expressed support for tariffs on PV imports to the US.

It said that the looming Section 232 tariffs on all polysilicon imports would “boost” American manufacturing and that further antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) levies would “strengthen our efforts to build an American advanced manufacturing champion”. Barcelo has also expressed support for Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” global tariff regime on all imports to the US.

Other industry observers and analysts have been more critical of the impacts of the president’s policies on solar manufacturing. We heard earlier this year from Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst at Clean Energy Associates (CEA), who said that the OBBBA was more damaging for manufacturers than solar development, as the twin issues of a shrinking solar end market and the removal of tax incentives to use US products put pressure on many firms.

However, PV Tech reported earlier this year that US solar manufacturing capacity has increased by 800% since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, and module capacity is roughly equal to the size of the US market in 2024. Upstream components remain more challenging, and much of the US module market will still rely on increasingly expensive cell and wafer imports for the foreseeable future.

26 First Nations people have been selected from over 100 applicants to participate in PowerMakers, a transformative capacity building program for First Nations people pursuing clean energy solutions in homes, communities, and on Country.

Designed and delivered by the First Nations Clean Energy Network with assistance from trusted experts in government, academia and industry, and our clean energy kin in Canada, this year’s annual PowerMakers program is being held in Mparntwe (Alice Springs), Northern Territory from 13-16 October 2025.

Karrina Nolan, co-Chair of the First Nations Clean Energy Network says:

“PowerMakers is about supporting and resourcing our community members to have access to knowledge and expertise to really engage in the clean energy transition.

“In the last 5 years we’ve seen a significant shift in the role of our communities in the transition to clean energy.

“The First Nations Clean Energy Network’s members through connecting community, industry and government have changed the story about what's possible when we genuinely engage and consent to projects.

“However, irregular temperatures and climatic extremes are exacerbating energy insecurity issues.

“We know that it's possible to play a greater role in how energy is generated and supplied, to respond to changing weather conditions, sub-standard housing and affordability, and to determine, collaborate and benefit-share in projects.

“First Nations groups – assisted by previous PowerMaker cohorts sharing knowledge back home with communities – are aware that work needs to be done to ensure our people aren’t left behind in Australia’s clean energy transition.

“Energy systems are typically designed around the needs of governments or utilities, rather than community members, making it difficult for First Nations to access rooftop solar and batteries and the cost savings enjoyed by so many people in Australia.

“Access to capital and innovative finance mechanisms through Special Investment Vehicles must be made available to First Nations groups to build energy justice outcomes in communities and on-Country, such as community-led projects reducing diesel reliance and which improve energy aﬀordability.

“And embedding First Nations rights in law and process, and Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) will accelerate Australia's renewable energy build-out, by reducing project delays, lowering risk, and unlocking underutilised economic resources.

“The 26 participants in this year’s PowerMakers are already doing trail blazing work advocating, planning or leading development of clean energy projects to secure affordable reliable energy, with others preparing for or skilled in negotiations with clean energy proponents around jobs and training, local procurement, benefit-sharing, equity participation, and sustainable values-based access to land and sea.

“PowerMakers is an investment in building the capacity and resourcing of communities towards First Nations ownership and economic development.

“By building on existing skills and knowledge, and sharing learnings and solutions, existing and emerging PowerMakers are ready to seek out, contribute to and benefit from the collective progress of First Nations leading the energy transition throughout Australia.”

PowerMaker 2025 participant Trinity Clarke, a Director of Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation in Queensland says:

“We’re very interested in sustainable clean and reliable power for our mob. Not having reliable power is something we experience every day.

“We have secured funding to build a community-owned microgrid in Wujal Wujal which is very exciting. We know the issues in our communities and it’s something we’ve wanted for a while.

“Owning our own energy means we can look at further aspirations around storing food, and setting up a dialysis clinic, and other measures most people around the country take for granted, but which stay out of reach when you don’t have reliable power.

“Right now we’re working hard to set up governance frameworks for our new majority Yalanji-owned power company backed by a partnership between Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation and Volt Advisory.

“PowerMakers will provide me with an opportunity to learn from other mob and share our power journey in Yalanji country.”

PowerMaker 2025 participant Mike Gilby, Director of Malyangapa Native Title Claimant Group from the tri-state pocket covering NSW, South Australia and Queensland says:

“Representing our native title group, I will use the opportunity at PowerMakers to sit and listen to what other Countrymen are doing on Country.

“I’ve been watching the evolution of clean energy over the past decade, starting with Snowy Hydro.

“My interest is hydro technology, and we’re looking at how we can repurpose the infrastructure already in place at those locks and weirs – from the Hume Dam all the way to the Murray Mouth, and we’re also looking at the clean energy corridors being constructed for transmission, with towers scattered along First Nations’ country.

“Our Malyangapa Native Title Claimant Group have had discussions with the clean energy industry, particularly around solar and wind farms. There’s no on-country projects yet but it’s certainly a conversation.

“It’s about thriving ecosystems that are driving our interests, to bring about some equilibrium in our part of the world.”

GM is halting development of its next-generation hydrogen fuel cells and closing its HYDROTEC division, including a $55 million Detroit facility.

The automaker will redirect investments toward electric vehicles, batteries, and charging technology, citing greater scalability and market demand.

The shift comes amid potential federal grant cancellations and underscores hydrogen’s limited infrastructure and high costs in the U.S.

General Motors will end development of next-generation hydrogen fuel cells under its HYDROTEC brand as it pivots more aggressively toward electric vehicles and battery technology. The decision also ends plans for a $55 million hydrogen fuel cell plant in Detroit that was expected to employ 144 workers in partnership with Piston Automotive, owned by former NBA player Vinnie Johnson.

As part of the move, GM laid off salaried employees primarily in Pontiac, Michigan, following the closure of its HYDROTEC plant. The company said it is prioritizing investments in EV technology and redirecting its workforce and supplier relationships toward that effort.

The decision reflects GM’s growing confidence in EVs and its doubts about hydrogen’s near-term viability for consumer applications. While hydrogen fuel cells offer quick refueling and long range, the high production cost and limited fueling network have restricted growth. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are only 61 hydrogen refueling stations nationwide compared to more than 250,000 Level 2 or faster EV charging locations.

Notably, GM will continue producing hydrogen fuel cells through Fuel Cell System Manufacturing LLC, a joint venture with Honda, to serve industrial and commercial sectors, including power generation, mining, and heavy trucking.

The move follows the Trump administration’s recent indication that it plans to cancel two federal grants totaling $52 million that were previously awarded to GM for hydrogen development projects in Pontiac. The federal government had already distributed $9 million of the funding before the potential reversal.

Lawlor is adamant that climate activists are human rights defenders.
Human rights are now being targeted in the rush for critical minerals and new sources of non-fossil energy.
“Governments are repressing human rights defenders and the current trajectory is incompatible with the realization of human rights for all.
On Thursday Lawlor will repeat calls on governments to stop treating climate defenders like enemies, and instead work with them on a just transition to prevent climate catastrophe.","Human rights defenders organizing to prevent climate catastrophe are facing a surge in reprisals, as governments around the world denigrate, delegitimize and criminalize activists in spite of worsening global heating, a top United Nations official has told the Guardian.

Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders since 2020, has documented hundreds of cases where states have sought to smear and silence climate defenders engaged in peaceful protest, non-violent civil disobedience and litigation.

“Attacks against climate defenders have surged over the course of the mandate, and we now see outright repression against people who are organizing for climate action. It’s some of the states that have claimed to be the strongest supporters of human rights defenders including the UK, Germany, France and the US, that are most often repressing climate activists and where the right to protest is being denigrated and delegitimized.

“These big countries spew out the rhetoric about 1.5C, but they don’t mean it. They are playing the game to suit themselves. It’s business as usual,” Lawlor said in an interview with the Guardian.

Lawlor will present the penultimate report of her six-year mandate, “Tipping points: Human rights defenders, climate change and a just transition”, to the UN general assembly on 16 October.

It documents state repression including police violence and surveillance, civil litigation deployed to deliberately wear down and silence climate defenders known as Slapp (strategic lawsuits against public participation), as well as bogus criminal charges ranging from sedition, criminal defamation, terrorism and conspiracy to trespass, to public disorder and to disobedience.

In December 2023, the Just Stop Oil member Stephen Gingell became the first person to be jailed under the UK’s new public order legislation after taking part for 30 minutes in a peaceful slow-march protest on a London road.

“The UK is leading by bad example, abusing the international standards to which it itself agreed by bringing in these draconian laws that are designed to stop protest against any of the issues that are uncomfortable for the UK government.”

In the US, about 1,000 criminal cases were brought in Minnesota against people involved in non-violent actions against the Line 3 oil pipeline, including charges of attempted assisted suicide and trespass on critical infrastructure. While most cases were eventually dismissed or overturned, legitimate concerns about Indigenous lands, environmental harm and climate impacts were ignored and the pipeline began operations in 2021.

The criminalization of Line 3 protesters mirrored the repression seen during the 2016 Indigenous-led movement against the Dakota Access pipeline in the US. “Both instances entailed close collaboration between the companies involved and the police, indicating the adoption of a blueprint for the repression of climate activism in the United States,” the report states.

The Guardian has previously reported on a criminalization playbook used against climate and environmental activists, that is being adopted and shared in the US and internationally.

One trend documented by Lawlor is the conflation of non-violent climate action with terrorism. In 2022, the French minister of interior at the time, and current minister of justice, accused the national environmental movement Les Soulèvements de la Terre of “ecoterrorism”. The government sought to close down the group, but the country’s highest administrative court eventually overturned the effort.

Lawlor is adamant that climate activists are human rights defenders. They use non-violent protest, disruptive civil disobedience and litigation to stop fossil fuel projects and pressure elected officials to take meaningful action precisely because they are trying to protect the right to food, clean water, health, life and a healthy environment.

“These people are exercising the right to defend human rights. Of course some climate groups are disruptive, but that’s because they tried so hard for so long to use normal run of the mill techniques to achieve change, and the government did nothing. Look at change throughout the century by people like Martin Luther King and Gandhi, civil disobedience is sometimes necessary,” said Lawlor, who is the founder and former executive director of Front Line Defenders and former director of the Irish branch of Amnesty International.

But it’s not just fossil fuels. Human rights are now being targeted in the rush for critical minerals and new sources of non-fossil energy. The same repressive playbook is being used by governments and private companies involved in land grabs, pollution and Indigenous rights violations in pursuit of a green transition.

In Vietnam, which has committed itself to a just transition and net-zero emissions by 2050, the environmental lawyer Dang Dinh Bach was sentenced to five years in prison in January 2022 on bogus charges of tax evasion. Bach, who is among several climate activists imprisoned in Vietnam after advocating for the transition away from coal, is a victim of arbitrary detention, according to UN experts.

In Kenya, police fired rubber bullets and teargas at villagers in Uyombo in 2024, who were peacefully protesting against construction of a nuclear power plant facility on their land without consent.

“Governments are repressing human rights defenders and the current trajectory is incompatible with the realization of human rights for all. It’s just a road to destruction … I think states are behaving in a criminal fashion,” Lawlor said.

On Thursday Lawlor will repeat calls on governments to stop treating climate defenders like enemies, and instead work with them on a just transition to prevent climate catastrophe.

In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency recommended stricter limits after new research showed mussels, snails and other aquatic life are more sensitive to ammonia than previously understood.

""EPA included additional species in its calculations, and the new recommendations are stricter than what's in our current regulations,"" said Mike Kruse, environmental program manager for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' Watershed Protection Section. ""We're proposing to adopt those standards to better protect aquatic life in Missouri streams and lakes.""

Unlike a single fixed number, ammonia criteria typically use formulas that vary depending on factors such as pH, or water temperature. Missouri regulators plan to calculate limits by using region-specific standards.

Kruse said the impact will be felt most by small rural communities that rely on lagoon systems, which were not designed to treat ammonia at the stricter levels. ""Upgrading them would mean essentially rebuilding the treatment plant,"" he said. ""For small communities with shrinking populations, that's a pretty significant cost.""

To ease the transition, the state is offering variances — temporary exceptions that let facilities show the highest level of treatment they can realistically achieve and request more time to comply with the new federal standards. Larger city plants must also meet the new requirements, but their infrastructure is better-equipped to handle the changes without major upgrades, Kruse said.

The DNRC held an open house this week to guide community representatives through the variance application process. Additional sessions are planned in the coming months.

The proposal now enters an 18-month public rulemaking process that includes writing a regulatory impact report followed by public comments and review by Missouri's Clean Water Commission, all before statewide enforcement.

This has been well reported, but the consequences of these changes on the private, not-for-profit sector, has not received as much attention.

The federal bureaucracy is an easy target for its critics. It has no coherent master plan. It began with core duties of any country (defense, diplomacy, treasury) but then had manage the geographic growth of the country. Then industrialization often erased state borders and federalized many policy areas. At key moments, constituency groups like veterans, labor groups, agricultural interests etc. requested government attention and regulatory agencies developed from periodic market failures, new technologies, or to quash discrimination. The resulting crazy quilt of agencies and departments is easy for critics to question.

Further, just as the federal government grew, significant corruption reforms led to civil servants being hired based on their expertise rather than political allegiance. The resulting neutral competence is beneficial, but does collide with principles that presidential elections provide clear mandates to govern. We both want neutral experts to craft policies but also want elections to matter, which has frustrated presidents long before President Trump, but it’s particularly vivid in this polarized age.

Consequently, the strange structure, tension between neutral competence and electoral responsiveness, and a particularly American resistance to centralized government has formed a conventional wisdom that the federal bureaucracy is way too big and clumsy.

International comparison

Interestingly, the US public sector is far smaller than other democracies. Federal, state, and local public sector employment in the US is around 25% lower than most European democracies, which matches the level that American government spending is lower than European Union countries’ public expenditures, despite far greater spending on defense in the US. Our taxes as a percentage of our overall economy are 25% to 40% lower than these countries as well.

Europeans are perfectly comfortable with a larger governing role in society. European Social Democrats and even European Conservative parties dominate elections and both believe that taxing and redistributing wealth bring social equality and stability. Despite our polarized rhetoric, both American parties prefer lower taxes and spending relative to European mainstream parties.

While American skepticism toward big government is deeply baked into our political culture, that does not mean Americans support dramatic cuts in practice. The Pew Research Center finds that a majority of Americans favor most federal agencies and, except for ICE, Justice, and the IRS, all named agencies have more people favoring them than not. Further, most public policy research indicates that the federal government performs well on efficiency relative to other democracies. And before DOGE, the Government Accountability Office has long closely audited government agencies and publicly reported inefficiencies, waste, and policies that didn’t measure up.

Whether the DOGE cuts are legal or responsible is being decided by courts and Congress. One ironic, less-discussed problem that may emerge from such sudden cuts is there potential harm for the not-for-profit sectors that Americans prefer tackling social issues like health, human services, education, and the arts.

Again, a comparative historical look is helpful. Most European countries fully democratized after the socialist movement, which simultaneously pressed for equality and democracy and created the welfare state systems. American democracy began well before the pressures of the industrial revolution and Americans, who had the right to vote across classes even if not gender and race, rejected socialism and large-scale welfare state. So American beliefs of individualism and limited government meant that civil society — churches and not-for-profits — tackled thorny social problems more so and prior to the federal government.

Leveraging the non-for-profit arena

When the US government did later step into these social issues due the scale of hardship from the depression and social inequalities, its policies leveraged not-for-profit partners rather than directly handling issues with government agency employees. This grant-based approach is a very American approach of strengthening civil society addressing policy problems rather than a government takeover.

The Urban Institute reports the level of these federal grants. About 27% of health, human services, education and arts-based not-for-profit groups receive federal grants, which is almost identical to the 26% of such Indiana not-for-profits that receive these federal grants. Two-thirds of these groups receive less than 25% of their funds from federal, state, or local grants, so the majority of their funding comes from the private sector.

It’s healthy to debate how much government should be spending, but during the debate it should be considered whether sudden cuts to what is around 25% of not-for-profit budgets could permanently damage groups doing social work. For instance, the network of groups that carries out humanitarian aid around the work that received USAID grants have been devastated by the USAID grant cuts. If major humanitarian issues develop — on top of those existing crushing ones — the private sector groups may be defunct or lack the capacity to address those problems.

Moving forward, it’s vital to consider the balance of public funds to the private sector. There’s consensus among Americans that civil society should be dealing with social issues. Consequently, ensuring that civil society groups thrive must be considered in the pace and level of cuts.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA105187-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:01:28.848971

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works.
Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant.
The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.
“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said.","This story is published in partnership with Inside Climate News and WHQR. It is the first in an ongoing series about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina, “Forever War.”

Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.

But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens within a family of chemicals that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.

Donovan felt devastated and enraged.

“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”

In 2013, scientists first discovered seven different types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several public utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.

The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians.

It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators, and local residents, started urging the EPA and state officials to regulate the compounds.

Many activists went to Congress and to the courts. Clean Cape Fear even pleaded its case to United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”

Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found PFAS in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs, and beer. Pine needles, honey, and house dust. Landfills, compost, and sewage sludge.

Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.

Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.

The celebration was brief.

Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin—with support from the chemical industry—began dismantling those hard-won protections.

And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.

“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”

2013-2016: A Movement Is Born

The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.

On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was releasing PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.

Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction, and environmental engineering at N.C. State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”

Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.

In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel, and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.

Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.

Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.

“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”

The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing, and playing in contaminated water.

As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.

We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.

When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.

Then a freelance reporter for the Wilmington Star-News, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings.

People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.

“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”

2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear

Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.

She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.

In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.

The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.

In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.

Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA, and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.

2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature

Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr. is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.

Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.

Yet after a contentious commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another one.

Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”

Davis, who became the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.

Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.

Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: a $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.

“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”

2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer

Brian Long, the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.

It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.

“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”

EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the liver, kidneys and immune system.

Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer.

Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain, and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.

New Hanover and Brunswick counties had some of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in North Carolina, according to the state cancer registry. Rates of testicular cancer were also significantly elevated in nearby Pender County, which later detected high levels of PFAS in its drinking water.

Several advocates felt illnesses in their family might be linked to PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.

Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, who had been diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.

Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.

She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”

One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.

“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.

The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”

2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal

Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:

Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin.

Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.

Steer the tired alligator to the bank.

Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).

Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.

Burdette helped N.C. State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators can live long lives in contaminated water, so they can serve as models for detecting human health problems.

The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 types of PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.

It had been more than a year since the contamination became public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.

Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.

“We sued,” Burdette said.

SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act.

By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.

“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”

By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.

No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.

DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.

“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”

In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.

“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”

Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses, and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.

“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”

At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.

“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”

Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”

Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.

2021-2022: Quest for Accountability

One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.

Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.

Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. N.C. State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.

In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.

“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”

The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.

In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.

The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.

2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers

Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.

Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA, and environmental advocates were becoming impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.

He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion, and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.

Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.

“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”

Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.

“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”

Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.

Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”

Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.

“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“

The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $2 billion to help utilities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, but that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.

In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.

Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.

Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.

May 2025: The Persistent Republican

It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.

“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”

Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.

If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance, and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.

“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”

A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick, and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.

“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”

Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.

The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.

Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.

“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”

With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.

2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained

A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.

The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.

Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at N.C. State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.

Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.

After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.

“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.

“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”

June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill

Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.

A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”

Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”

“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”

The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.

Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.

Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.

The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.

September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX Rollback

In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.

“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”

The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it did so out of sequence.

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.

Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.

Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period, during which over More than 120,000 comments were submitted—including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.

The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.

Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized the standards simultaneously, instead of moving through each action separately. This, Zeldin argued, “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”

Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.

A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”

Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.

The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.

“Chemours is using this as their basis for saying the science is flawed,” she said. “That’s ridiculous.”

The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.

However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.

EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.

More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.

It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.

“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”

The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus, and Pender counties.

This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing; of those, state records show nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.

Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.

DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

In a time of rapid technological change and global geopolitical flux, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is executing one of the most ambitious transformations in its history. At the intersection of science, economic policy, and national security, the Research, Technology, and Economic Security (RTES) framework represents a bold attempt to futureproof the nation’s energy architecture while ensuring responsible stewardship of public funds. In doing so, the DOE is not only refining how it governs federal investments but also how it positions America as a science and technology leader in a competitive global landscape.

The priorities of the DOE, the risk-based mechanisms underlying the RTES framework, and how those efforts are translating into tangible impacts, from protecting intellectual property (IP) and strengthening supply chains to fostering energy independence and global clean energy leadership, are evolving. The conversation comes at a critical time when American leadership in energy innovation could determine not just economic prosperity but also geopolitical leverage. Stakeholders from policy, industry, and academia will need to be aware of these changes, as they can gain particular value from understanding how the DOE is operationalizing RTES to drive resilience, growth, and sustainability simultaneously.

Resilient by design: Core elements of the RTES framework

The Research, Technology, and Economic Security (RTES) memo (1), formally adopted in November 2024, provides a comprehensive lens through which the DOE governs risk, value, and opportunity across its energy and research portfolio. It reflects a structured, harmonized, and nuanced approach to balancing open innovation with national security imperatives. Let us explore it in more detail.

Taxpayer-first risk discipline:

The framework places strong emphasis on transparency and accountability in the management of federal funding. One key example is the DOE’s policy change introduced in May 2025 to cap indirect cost reimbursements, with 10% for state and local governments and 15% for non-profits and for-profit institutions. These reforms are projected to save taxpayers nearly $935 million annually. (2)

Proportional risk mitigation:

RTES incorporates a tiered, stage-specific system to assess and mitigate risks across basic research, applied development, and full-scale deployment. By categorizing activities by technology readiness levels, the DOE applies proportionate risk controls to different funding instruments, including grants, loans, and cooperative agreements.

Multi-dimensional risk coverage:

From IP theft and supply chain dependencies to grid security and foreign influence, RTES covers a broad array of risk dimensions. The framework empowers program officers to implement tailored controls across the award lifecycle, informed by inputs from DOE’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. (3)

Enabling strategic collaboration:

Perhaps most critically, the DOE retains a commitment to open science and international collaboration. The framework recognizes that foreign partnerships and talent exchange are foundational to U.S. leadership in scientific discovery and innovation, so long as the risks are assessed and managed.

Turning policy into practice: Real-world deployments and case studies

The implications of the RTES framework are already visible across multiple operational domains. DOE program offices and National Labs are actively applying their principles to shape funding decisions, partnership eligibility, and technology investments. Let us introduce the main elements.

Supply chain resilience with the SCRL tool:

The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), in partnership with the National Laboratories, developed the Supply Chain Readiness Levels (SCRL) tool. (4) This analytics platform maps vulnerabilities in critical energy supply chains, especially dependencies on “covered nations”, and guides both federal and private sector investment priorities. The tool is being used to address supply risk in battery minerals, transformers, and grid components.

Geothermal innovation pilots:

In 2024, the DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office announced over $30 million in funding for reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) demonstration projects. (5) These pilots are testing new wellbore construction and high-temperature tools that can serve as baseload renewable power, offering grid flexibility while reducing emissions.

Scientific integrity and IP protection:

The RTES Office mandates complete disclosure of foreign affiliations and institutional partnerships in all grant and contract proposals. This has led to the rejection or revision of several projects where IP risk or foreign control could not be mitigated. These processes ensure the integrity of federal investments in high-impact R&D. (6)

Post-2025 energy dominance agenda:

Following the return of President Trump in 2025, the DOE issued sweeping secretarial orders to accelerate fossil fuel permitting, expand LNG exports, and reauthorize offshore oil and gas leases. Within 100 days, the DOE approved more new LNG export capacity than any nation outside the U.S. possesses, cementing the country’s status as the top oil and gas producer and exporter. (7)

Building a clean tech superpower: Renewable energy and economic growth

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) plays a central role in advancing clean energy innovation and commercialization. The EERE has streamlined its strategy around high-potential domains such as solar, wind, hydrogen, bioenergy, and sustainable mobility. Let us see how this is progressing.

Capitalizing on a $23 trillion market:

With the global renewable energy market projected to exceed $23 trillion by 2030, the U.S. is positioning itself to capture market share through smart policy and strategic public investment. Programs like the Loan Programs Office and clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act are enabling private capital leverage, creating manufacturing hubs, and generating clean jobs. (8)

Job creation and economic renewal:

Since 2021, clean energy projects have attracted more than $450 billion in private investment and created over 400,000 new jobs across sectors such as solar panel manufacturing, wind turbine logistics, battery storage, and electric vehicles. These gains have helped revitalize regional economies and support the U.S. manufacturing base. (9)

Health and household benefits:

Energy-efficient technologies are reducing household utility bills, improving indoor air quality, and cutting emissions that contribute to respiratory disease. DOE analysis suggests that combined benefits from clean energy deployment could generate tens of billions of dollars annually in public health savings. (10)

The road ahead: Future trends and strategic challenges

As the RTES framework matures and implementation scales, several trends and hurdles will define its long- term success. The use of analytical platforms like SCRL will be essential in dynamically tracking supply chain risks. Expanding these tools to cover emerging sectors such as hydrogen, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), and rare earth magnets could help preempt future dependencies.

Furthermore, navigating the dual mandate of open science and secure innovation will remain challenging. The DOE must continue refining its evaluation criteria to allow for collaboration without compromising IP integrity or national competitiveness.

In terms of scaling deployment infrastructure, the U.S. will need trillions in grid upgrades, workforce training, and permitting reform to accommodate the full potential of renewable energy resources. This will require bipartisan policy support, private sector coordination, and ongoing EERE leadership.

Finally, geopolitical volatility persists. As tensions with China, Russia, and other state actors persist, the DOE’s RTES playbook must remain agile, balancing proactive risk mitigation with a forward-looking innovation strategy.

Final thoughts: Innovation secured and scaled

The U.S. Department of Energy’s RTES framework represents a paradigm shift in how public research dollars are governed. By weaving risk management into the core of its investment and oversight processes, DOE is charting a path toward resilience without sacrificing scientific openness. From grid security and clean energy leadership to economic development and international collaboration, the stakes of energy innovation have never been higher.

Through the synergy of EERE’s innovation programs and RTES’s accountability structures, the U.S. is laying the groundwork for a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous energy future. What remains now is to scale that vision with purpose, clarity, and enduring public trust.

But many Wisconsinites, including prominent figures such as comedian Charlie Berens, have raised concerns about the environmental impact the data center boom will have.
One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington.","Wisconsin has become a hotbed of data center activity over the past few years as some of the biggest names in the business rush to take advantage of accessible water, affordable electricity and the state’s cool climate.

At least 47 data centers are currently up and running or proposed in Wisconsin, according to Data Center Map. But experts say there could be more because some companies obscure their plans by entering into non-disclosure agreements and creating shell companies. The state’s vast supply of water, relatively affordable and available electricity, available land and colder climate to assist with cooling needs are attractive, experts add.

Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still said Wisconsin has been attracting a lot of data center activity lately because there’s a lot of available land, utilities have historically been reliable and the state’s construction industry is skilled and large enough to build the vast structures.

“I think that just finding the kinds of people who can work in these data centers is not as much of a challenge as it might be in other places, because there are computer science schools and tech colleges and other places that can help fill those jobs,” he added.

Wisconsin ranks behind other Midwestern states, though. Michigan has at least 57 data centers; Minnesota, 72; Indiana, 74; Iowa, 104; and Illinois, 222, according to DCM.

Almost half of those in Wisconsin, 21, are located in the Milwaukee area, with 11 in the Madison area and five in and around Kenosha. The rest are scattered around central Wisconsin, a DCM map shows.

DCM, founded in 2007, sources information from data center operators, end-users, through manual sourcing and more.

But many Wisconsinites, including prominent figures such as comedian Charlie Berens, have raised concerns about the environmental impact the data center boom will have. People are also concerned about rising utility costs associated with the increased demand on the power grid. A study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University found data centers are expected to grow electricity bills by as much as 25% in certain regions of the country.

What is a data center, and where are they?

Technically, a data center can be any room, building or facility housing information technology infrastructure for building, running and developing applications and services, according to IBM. Under that definition, anything from an in-house server room in an office to the more than 7 million square-feet of space at The Citadel Campus in Reno, Nevada, could be considered a data center.

One of the data centers proposed in Wisconsin is the $8 billion, 672-acre Vantage data center near Port Washington. The Port Washington Common Council in August approved a development deal to move forward with the project’s Denver-based company. But the Vantage project will only be a small portion of the larger 1,900-acre data center campus that Cloverleaf Infrastructure is planning.

The Washington-based developer touts “delivering clean-powered, ready-to-build projects,” but hasn’t announced who else will occupy the campus.

Aside from the difficulty in figuring out exactly how many and where all the data centers and projects are, it’s difficult to quantify how large each project is. DCM reports out of the 10,844 data centers it’s tracking, only 3,836 include how much power in megawatts they use, and just 1,812 include total building size.

Another large data center investment, at least by dollar amount, comes from Microsoft’s more than $7 billion plan to build two data centers at the former Foxconn site in Racine County’s Mount Pleasant.

That plan, which includes at least 1,575 acres, doesn’t include the two other recent Microsoft data center plans in nearby Caledonia and Kenosha. Microsoft in January purchased 240 acres in Kenosha. The Caledonia Plan Commission Sept. 29 approved amending a land-use plan to rezone a 245-acre site, but less than two weeks later Microsoft announced it was backing out of its Caledonia effort, citing “community concerns.”

Microsoft also announced it still plans to find another site in southeastern Wisconsin instead of Caledonia.

Those projects, if the company’s Caledonia replacement is the same size, would bring Microsoft’s total footprint to more than 2,000 acres of data centers in southeastern Wisconsin, but they’re not the only company vying to occupy such large tracts of land.

Some data centers, like the Wells Building, owned by 1547 Critical Systems Realty, are much less conspicuous. The structure, a 15-story building and one of Milwaukee’s oldest skyscrapers, has occupied the same lot in the heart of downtown since 1901.

The 124-year-old structure has long been a communication hub and houses more than 30 carriers such as AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon. As communication technology has changed, so too has the building’s infrastructure. Under 1547’s ownership, the Wells Building now boasts up to 12 megawatts of building capacity power and 5,000 square feet of currently available data center space.

But that power capacity pales in comparison to large-scale data centers.

Environmental impact

Cloverleaf boasts it will be ready to deliver 3.5 gigawatts of power by 2030. That’s nearly 300 times as much as the Wells Building.

Microsoft’s first Mount Pleasant project and the Vantage project combined will require roughly 3.9 gigawatts of power. That’s not including Microsoft’s second Mount Pleasant project.

Clean Wisconsin in an analysis of the two projects found that’s enough power for roughly 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, more than the roughly 2.8 million housing units that currently exist in the state.

Amy Barrilleaux, Clean Wisconsin’s communications director, also said the speed at which companies are forging ahead makes it difficult to quantify the environmental impact they will have. But it’s clear there will be lasting effects, she added.

“It is going to push Wisconsin into a place where we’re not any closer to our clean energy goals, our climate goals, in a summer when we’ve had terrible smoke and severe flooding,” she said. “And so I think we’re seeing, just in terms of the sheer demand of energy that these data centers are going to need, we’re seeing how big that is.”

Water consumption is another major concern, Barrilleaux said.

Many past data center designs required continual water consumption, pumping it into cooling systems to reduce the heat of technology and then pumping it right back out of the facility again. Newer designs tend to use closed-loop designs, which are filled with water that circulates through the technology and then is cooled back down through large radiators, similar to a car’s radiator system.

But the closed-loop design is a trade-off, Barrilleuz said, adding “those systems are more energy intensive.”

“So it’s important to understand that 70% of water withdrawals in Wisconsin are for power generation in this state,” she said. “So we do not have a good understanding of what the true water impact is going to be in Wisconsin, because we don’t, for most of these projects, know how much energy they’re going to use. We don’t know how many gallons of water they’re going to use on site. We don’t know exactly where they’re going to be getting this water from.”

Dan Diorio, vice president of the Data Center Coalition, said water usage by data centers in Virginia, the nation’s data center hub, is sustainable, and the state’s regulations help ensure things stay that way. He also argued the industry “is committed to responsible water use, and it prioritizes efficient water practices and responsible management across operations and development.”

“Data centers are also actively investing in and deploying innovations, such as waterless cooling systems, closed-loop systems, and the use of recycled or reclaimed water,” Diorio said. “The industry also engages in water and watershed conservation and restoration projects in local communities and globally.”

Wisconsin Tech Council President Tom Still also said it’s worth keeping an eye on how much power and water data centers will consume, as well as the ability to meet the demands without generating a large amount of pollution.",https://www.wisbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1000015938.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:09:45.471358

Sizewell C, which will be built near Leiston in Suffolk, has agreed a six-year supply contract with Urenco - and a long-term fuel fabrication contract with Framatome.

The former will make natural uranium suitable for use at the power plant, before the latter turns it into pellets, which then form fuel assemblies for use inside its reactors.

Those behind the deal predict it will support and create thousands of jobs within the industry and minimise the plant's reliance on fuel imports.

Julia Pyke and Nigel Cann, joint managing directors of Sizewell C, said: ""These two contracts represent a major moment for Sizewell C and for energy security in the UK.

""The fuel that will go in our reactors will be low carbon and predominantly sourced from the UK, produced by skilled British workers.

""This is what we mean by doing infrastructure differently – and it puts the UK's energy security and our nuclear supply chain in a much stronger place.""

Sizewell C, which will cost £38bn to build, will supply electricity to the equivalent of six million homes for at least 60 years once it is operational, predicted to be in the 2030s.

Those behind the development say the project will directly support 10,000 jobs and thousands more in the supply chain, and create 1,500 apprenticeships.

Some of those include around 1,000 existing jobs at Urenco's enrichment site at Capenhurst, near Chester.

Sizewell's deal with Framatome, meanwhile, will initially see the fuel fabricated at its factory in Romans, France, until its new UK facility is built, creating yet more jobs.

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said.
The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project.
WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification.","More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.

The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.

“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.

The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.

Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.

“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”

Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.

“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”

Battery power and rural grid upgrade

The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.

The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide this is to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”

The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.

The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”

Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.

The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.

Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.

The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.

Energy efficiency and innovation

Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.

“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.

Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.

Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.

Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.

The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.

If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.

A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.

“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”

Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.

‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program

A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.

“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”

Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out.

Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.

“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”

WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.

If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Power-lines___Scott-Olson-Getty-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:05.670951

The company also faces legal challenges from the California Coastal Commission, environmental groups and even its own investors.
Although the company reports that pipeline repairs are complete, the lines have not yet been approved for restart by state regulators.
However, the company says it continues to seek approvals to restart the pipelines from the California Office of the State Fire Marshal.
Sable Offshore Corp. is no different.”","When a Texas oil company first announced controversial plans to reactivate three drilling rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara County, investor presentations boasted that the venture had “massive resource potential” and was “primed for cash flow generation.”

But now, less than two years later, mounting legal setbacks and regulatory issues are casting increasing doubt on the project’s future.

Most recently, the California attorney general filed suit against Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp., accusing it of repeatedly putting “profits over environmental protections.” The lawsuit, filed last week in Santa Barbara County Superor Court, accuses Sable of continually failing to follow state laws and regulations intended to protect water resources.

Sable, the lawsuit claims, “was at best misinformed, incompetent and incorrect” when it came to understanding and adhering to the California Water Code. “At worst, Sable was simply bamboozling the Regional Water Board to meet a critical deadline,” according to the lawsuit.

The action comes less than a month after the Santa Barbara County district attorney’s office filed criminal charges against the company, accusing it of knowingly violating state environmental laws while working on repairs to oil pipelines that have sat idle since a major spill in 2015.

The company also faces legal challenges from the California Coastal Commission, environmental groups and even its own investors.

These developments now threaten the company’s ability to push forward on what has become an increasingly expensive and complicated project, according to some experts.

Clark Williams-Derry, an analyst for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said there are still ways Sable could get off the ground and begin oil sales, but the repeated setbacks have become what he called “cumulative risk” for investors, who are key to funding the restart.

“Sable is at risk of burning through its cash, and lenders are going to have to make a decision about whether or not this is a good investment,” Williams-Derry said. Ongoing pushback from the public, the state and in lawsuits makes that increasingly a hard argument to make, he said.

Sable, however, said it remains steadfast in its goal of reactivating the Santa Ynez Unit — a complex of three offshore platforms, onshore processing facilities and connecting pipelines. The unit was shuttered by a different company a decade ago after a corroded section of pipeline ruptured near Refugio State Beach, creating one of the state’s worst oil spills.

The company denies that it has broken any laws and insists that it has followed all necessary regulations. Recently, however, company officials have promoted a new restart plan that could avoid California oversight.

Company officials say the new plan would keep the project entirely within federal waters — pivoting away from using the contentious pipelines and from what company officials called California’s “crumbling energy complex.”

Jim Flores, the company’s chief executive, said Sable is working with the Trump administration’s National Energy Dominance Council on the plan to use an offshore storage and treatment vessel to transport crude from its offshore wells instead of the pipeline system. Although the company reports that pipeline repairs are complete, the lines have not yet been approved for restart by state regulators.

“California has to make a decision soon on the pipeline before Sable signs an agreement for the [offshore vessel] and goes all in on the offshore federal-only option,” Flores said in a statement.

The company acknowledges that transporting oil by ship instead of pipeline would dramatically extend the company’s timeline and increase its costs. In a June Securities and Exchange Commission report, Sable said there was “substantial doubt ... about the company’s ability to continue,” given ongoing negative cash flow and stalled regulatory approvals.

However, the company says it continues to seek approvals to restart the pipelines from the California Office of the State Fire Marshal.

The state fire marshal has said the plans remain under review, but the office has made clear that the pipelines will be approved for operation only “once all compliance and safety requirements, including ... approvals from other state, federal and local agencies, are met.”

Deborah Sivas, a professor of environmental law at Stanford’s Law School, said it’s getting harder to see a successful path forward for Sable.

“It’s pretty rare that an entity would have all these agencies lined up concerned about their impacts,” Sivas said of state regulators. “These agencies don’t very lightly go to litigation or enforcement actions. ... and the public is strongly against offshore drilling. So those are a whole bunch of reasons that I think are going to be hard obstacles for that company.”

But even if Sable can pivot to federal-only oversight under a friendly Trump administration, Williams-Derry said there’s no clear-cut path.

“This is an environment where some of the best, most profitable oil companies in the U.S. have cut drilling this year because profits are too low,” Williams-Derry said. Sable has enough money in the bank right now to have a “little bit of running room,” he said, “...but you can imagine that [investors] are going to start running out of patience.”

The new lawsuit filed by the California attorney general lays out a year’s worth of instances in which Sable either ignored or defied the California Water Code during the firm’s pipeline repair work. The attorney general’s office called Sable’s evasion of regulatory oversight “egregious,” warranting “substantial penalties.”

It’s not immediately clear how much will be demanded, but violations of the California Water Code are subject to a civil liability of up to $5,000 for each day a violation occurs.

Despite repeated reminders and warnings from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast region, Sable did not comply with the water code, preventing the board “from assuring best management practices ... to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to water quality,” the lawsuit said.

“No corporation should gain a business advantage by ignoring the law and harming the environment,” Jane Gray, chair of the Central Coast Water Board, said in a statement. “Entities that discharge waste are required to obtain permits from the state to protect water quality. Sable Offshore Corp. is no different.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0fdaa47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Fd1%2F6e1a5a8847218fc2fa84bcfd9def%2F1501692-me-coastal-commission-hearing-27.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:54.465514

Commissioned in the end of 2021, the 1000 kV Nanchang substation is an important node of the central China’s double-looped 1000 kV UHV grid and the first 1000 kV UHV substation in Jiangxi Province. It plays a crucial role in strengthening interconnection between Hunan and Jiangxi, increasing inter-provincial sending/receiving capability, facilitating the unified consumption of renewable energy in Jiangxi and Hunan, and containing short-circuit current levels across the Central China grid.

As an essential part of UHV grid construction, the Nanchang 1000 kV substation expansion project will further support the station’s stable operation and future development. This corridor also forms part of a broader four-province AC backbone linking Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, enabling large-scale clean-power transfers and improving system flexibility across the region. Hitachi Energy’s 1100 kV GIS will provide strong support to achieve these objectives.

“China's systematic deployment in the UHV grid sector has laid a solid foundation for renewable energy development and secure power supply. We are honored to support the expansion of Nanchang 1000 kV UHV substation — a major milestone for Hitachi Energy's GIS technology in the world's highest-voltage networks,” said James Zhao, Executive Vice President and Region head of Greater China, Hitachi Energy. “Leveraging our leading technology, we remain committed to advancing China's UHV strategy and China's low-carbon energy transition.”

Hitachi Energy’s 1100 kV GIS technology is engineered for insulation coordination. It offers the performance and reliability required by duties and reliability requirements of China’s 1000 kV AC UHV system, combining a compact layout with high mechanical endurance and comprehensive lifecycle services. Manufacturing will take place at Hitachi Energy’s high-voltage switchgear facility in Xiamen, China.

“We are proud to deploy the 1100 kV GIS technology in China – the highest voltage level in the world and under the most stringent grid requirements,” said Markus Heimbach, Managing Director of the High Voltage Products Business Unit, Hitachi Energy. “This installation demonstrates the strength of our technology, enhances grid efficiency, and supports China’s transition to widespread electrification.”",https://dynamic-assets.hitachienergy.com/is/image/hitachiabbpowergrids/nanchang_2400x1028:16-9?wid=1440&hei=810&fmt=png-alpha&fit=crop%2C1,N,,2025-10-13 06:59:15.071598

Pennsylvanians shouldn’t have to pay the price for permitting delays, with fewer reliable energy options, because Washington can’t fix a broken permitting system.
It’s time to reform permitting and start building again in Pennsylvania and across America.","We all know the value of affordable and reliable energy. From powering homes and businesses to supporting hundreds of thousands of good jobs for Pennsylvanians, energy means jobs, growth and opportunity. But demand for energy is surging fast.

America’s electricity demand is projected to increase 35 to 50 percent by 2040, driven in large part by new AI data centers.

In the PJM Interconnection, which includes Pennsylvania, 95 percent of new power demand through 2030 is expected to come from data centers, further straining a system that’s slow to bring new power sources online. Replacing retiring power sources, particularly reliable baseload power like natural gas, is essential to powering AI and keeping the lights on for American families.

A broken federal permitting system

The rapid rise of technology and the race for America’s future brings new urgency to fixing a broken, inefficient permitting system where projects are often stuck in red tape and buried in endless reviews, thus blocking the critical infrastructure needed to keep pace with demand.

Infrastructure project of all kinds – pipelines, power plants, transmission lines – even roads and bridges – face a myriad of federal approvals under a maze of outdated laws and regulations. Opponents regularly weaponize statutes like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA) to block development at every stage of permitting.

In natural gas-rich Pennsylvania and the Appalachia region, more takeaway capacity, including pipelines, is needed to move energy from the drilling field to consumers.

Major pipelines in the region, including PennEast, Constitution and Atlantic Coast, were cancelled after years of permitting delays and court challenges.

After nearly six years of lawsuits and delays, it took an act of Congress to help finish the 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline, which links Appalachian basin natural gas to markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

When infrastructure lags behind demand, supply tightens. Building new infrastructure helps energy flow faster to consumers and could help keep costs affordable.

While the Trump administration has taken steps to stop harmful mandates and restrictive energy policies to help bolster American energy dominance, congressional action on permitting reform is urgently needed to unlock America’s potential and get back to building. Enacting commonsense deadlines and predictable permitting processes can help ensure projects are built in years, not decades.

Three key areas must be addressed: 1) set deadlines and enforce them, 2) stop lawsuits and start building and 3) enforce targeted reviews and swift decisions.

Pennsylvania stands ready to build

Energy-rich Pennsylvania can benefit from permitting reform. Sitting atop the Marcellus shale, the largest natural gas formation in the U.S., Pennsylvania is the second-largest natural gas producer in America.

Pennsylvania has the natural resources and skilled workforce to advance U.S. energy dominance and build a stronger economy. Permitting reform can help unleash Pennsylvania energy to support innovation while creating good jobs and helping to keep energy costs affordable for consumers.

Without permit reform, Pennsylvanians could face energy shortages, much like they do in California and New England, where policy roadblocks restrict energy access and infrastructure projects.

Pennsylvanians shouldn’t have to pay the price for permitting delays, with fewer reliable energy options, because Washington can’t fix a broken permitting system. This doesn’t mean cutting corners on safety or the environment – it means using common sense, establishing clear deadlines and keeping critical projects moving forward – not trapped in red tape and litigation.

Congress must act on durable reforms that help ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come while helping to power U.S. technology and innovation.

It’s time to reform permitting and start building again in Pennsylvania and across America.

“Everybody’s able to share.” Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities.","For years, Western leaders have debated the creation of a regional energy market: a coordinated grid to pool solar power in Arizona, wind in Wyoming, hydro in Washington and battery storage in California.

The shared resources would meet the demands of 11 different states, bolstering utilities’ local power plants with surplus energy from across the region.

With the passage of a landmark new law in California, that market is finally on its way to becoming a reality. Proponents say it has the potential to lower energy costs, make the grid more resilient and speed up the deployment of clean energy.

But the market’s success, experts agree, depends heavily on which states and utilities decide to opt in. As energy issues have become increasingly politicized, it’s uncertain whether Western leaders can buy into a common vision for meeting the region’s power needs.

“As we move toward weather-dependent renewables to run our grid, we’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern,” said California Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation aimed at establishing the new market. “A Western energy market is critical.”

The California measure earned bipartisan support, and leaders in conservative and liberal states alike have long touted the benefits of a region-wide market.

But some skeptics worry about merging the power systems of states with varying climate goals. And some fear the new market could give federal regulators appointed by President Donald Trump an opening to interfere and mandate more fossil fuel-powered plants that can be turned on regardless of the weather.

A bigger market

Across the 11 Western states that straddle or sit west of the Rocky Mountains, 37 separate private and public utilities operate portions of the grid.

States Reimagine Power Grids for Wind and Solar Future

This fragmented structure differs from the grid systems in Eastern and Midwestern states, where regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, coordinate and plan for energy needs across vast swaths of the country.

Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.

Under the current system, each utility is required by state public utility commissions to build enough power to meet peak energy demands. That could mean building gas plants that only turn on a few times a year during extreme heat waves.

As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity. Such agreements could also prevent the periodic shutdowns of wind and solar farms when they produce more energy than local utilities can use.

“We could be drawing on the solar resources from the Southwest during the day, and then in the evening the wind resources in Montana and Wyoming are a great benefit,” said Austin Scharff, senior energy policy specialist with the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We have a lot of hydro resources, and we can help make sure the regional grid stays balanced when those are needed.”

Some industry leaders say such trading would allow states to pull in cheap electricity from elsewhere, rather than building expensive new power plants.

“When you have this bigger market, not everybody has to build to their peak in the same way,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “Everybody’s able to share.”

Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities. Utilities spanning much of the West also transact through a real-time market that allows them to address pressing short-term demand issues. Some are poised to join a new day-ahead market that will conduct planning based on daily demand and production forecasts.

But some lawmakers and officials believe the region needs a larger vision that goes beyond moment-by-moment needs, a market that can plan interstate transmission lines and energy projects to serve the whole region in the decades to come.

“We’re facing really rapidly growing energy demand,” said Nevada Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “The best way for us to meet that is to effectively move energy all across the Western U.S. The only way we can do that is through an RTO.”

Watts sponsored a bill, enacted in 2021, that requires Nevada to join an RTO by 2030. Colorado also passed a law that year with a 2030 deadline for utilities to join an RTO.

“Any future is better than our status quo, which is 37 separate grids in the West,” said Chris Hansen, a former Democratic senator who sponsored the Colorado legislation. “We can lower costs and provide greater reliability if we’re sharing resources.”

Hansen now serves as CEO of La Plata Electric Association, an electric cooperative in southwestern Colorado.

A new market

The push for a West-wide market had always faced one major hurdle: Any market would likely include the massive geographical footprint and energy supply managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. As the West’s largest grid operator, CAISO manages the flow of electricity across most of the Golden State. It’s governed by a five-member board appointed by California’s governor, and other states were unlikely to sign up for a market in which they have no representation.

The law passed by California legislators last month allows for a new organization with independent governance from across the region to oversee Western energy markets.

“This legislation is a key reset and has been the largest sticking point in building a regional market,” said Amanda Ormond, managing director of the Western Grid Group, which advocates for a more efficient grid. “This is a primary concern of a lot of folks that has now been solved.”

Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

The law sets in motion a yearslong process that will task regional leaders with establishing the organization’s governance and navigating a series of regulatory procedures. The new market could be in place by 2028.

State leaders across the West say the California law is a long-awaited development.

“You get this really good benefit from being able to optimize across a larger footprint than an individual utility can,” said Tim Kowalchik, research director with the Utah Office of Energy Development. “Those resources can play really well together.”

Utah led a study in 2021, collaborating with other Western states, exploring the potential for energy markets in the region. State officials say the research has helped drive the current effort.

“It was fascinating how substantial the benefits were,” said Letha Tawney, chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. “The interdependence of the West started to become much more apparent, and it really changed the conversation.”

The study looked at a variety of market options and found that an RTO would have significant benefits, lowering costs for electricity customers and promoting clean energy. Based on the study’s projections, the market would produce roughly $2 billion in gross benefits per year, largely by saving utilities from building extra capacity.

Another study in 2022, conducted by a pair of consulting firms, found that an RTO would create as many as 657,000 permanent jobs and bolster the region’s economy.

While Western leaders say the potential benefits are massive, no states outside of Nevada and Colorado have committed to joining a regional RTO. State leaders say they’ll be watching carefully to see what emerges from the new California law. While the decision on joining the market will largely be left to individual utilities, state regulators can play a major role by directing them to conduct an economic analysis of such a move.

State sovereignty

The push for a regional market has also faced opposition from skeptics who fear it undermines states’ power to set their own energy and climate goals. Some point to Eastern governors’ frustration with PJM Interconnection, the RTO that manages the grid across a swath of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

“It’s very dangerous,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a California-based nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re giving up control of our sovereignty. Once a state’s in, it’s not the state that has the control.”

Some experts fear that states with significant coal or gas industries may be hesitant to join a market that could incentivize their utilities to import cheap solar power from elsewhere. On the flip side, some climate advocates in California are wary of plugging into a market that could support coal power from out of state.

“Some states are parochial-minded: ‘This is a California thing, and we don’t want anything to do with California,’” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit climate-focused group. “That one state’s government will not decide how a market will be operated, it’s a seismic shift in the industry.”

Trump’s bid to support coal could cost ratepayers billions, report finds

Backers of an RTO argue that it can incorporate states’ varying energy goals. They point to research showing that the market will support renewable power. But others fear merging fates with coal-heavy states could give federal regulators more leverage to intervene in favor of fossil-fuel power.

Even if Trump is out of office when the market comes online, the regulators he appoints to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will still be serving out their terms. Some believe FERC could set rules that require the new market to favor fossil fuel-powered resources.

“When you have a mixed market with a lot of coal plants, it creates opportunities for the Trump administration to rejigger the rules to favor coal,” said Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a California-based consumer advocacy group. “In another reality, this would have sounded like a hysterical concern, but it’s pretty obvious where [Trump’s appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] want to go.”

Freedman’s group pushed California lawmakers for protections that would have given states more flexibility to withdraw from the market, while also prohibiting “resource adequacy” mandates that could be used by the feds to prop up coal. While those elements were included in a Senate version of the bill, they were stripped from the Assembly bill that ultimately was passed.

Supporters of the bill say such concerns are overblown, and the new market is structured to avoid the pitfalls facing other RTOs.

“The simple economic fact is that right now clean energy resources are the cheapest in the world,” said Petrie-Norris, the law’s sponsor. “We’re going to see solar displacing dirty fuels rather than the reverse.”

Much depends on convincing states and utilities it’s in their best interests to join the market. The strength-in-numbers advantages of an RTO depend on widespread participation. While many Western leaders have long touted a region-wide market, the opportunity is arising at a time where energy has become a partisan issue.

Meanwhile, the long-awaited market emerging from California is facing new competition from the east. The Southwest Power Pool, an Arkansas-based RTO serving the middle of the country, is expanding its footprint in the West, with several utilities poised to join its day-ahead market.

“Anytime you have two neighboring utilities in different markets, you have seams that create a lot of friction and inefficiency,” said Rubin Shen, with the energy industry group. “Whether or not everybody can come together and be all-in on a full West-wide market, it’s too soon to tell.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/020325_intermountain_power_plant_06_7201760346364.jpg?h=34e43602&itok=BnWQv0m4,N,,2025-10-13 06:59:20.156020

Built from mass timber and packed with more than 40 distinct sustainability strategies, the site functions as a full-scale testbed to trial, analyse and refine greener ways of running a high-volume delivery network.

The goal is simple: keep packages moving at full speed, while learning how to cut emissions and waste across Amazon’s vast supply chain.

The facility, named DII5, stands out from Amazon’s typical concrete and steel distribution centres. It uses Southern Yellow Pine cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels and glulam beams for its structure - materials known for their low embodied carbon.

That’s the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions linked to building materials, from extraction to construction. Amazon claims this is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States.""

Inside and out, the Elkhart site combines design and function. Clerestory windows let in daylight along the delivery floor, a nod to energy-saving and employee wellbeing. The building uses bio-based insulation, salvaged wood desks and air-source heat pumps - an alternative to gas utilities.

These choices all contribute to a reduced operational footprint.

Kara Hurst, Amazon’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says the company is pushing to move quickly: “In climate action, we need to move fast.

""So our teams got creative and asked: ‘What if we created a real-world testing ground for some of the best sustainability initiatives, in one place?’ That’s exactly what we did at DII5, our brand-new mass timber delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana.”

Real-time testing in a live supply chain

Unlike typical pilot projects, this delivery station is live. Every day, more than125 EVs operate from the site, supported by 170 EV charging stations. Packages are still going out on time. That’s part of what makes DII5 different – it allows Amazon to test green strategies without halting operations.

“We're tracking multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity, etc,” adds Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s Vice President of Global Realty.

“We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.”

Water systems offer another angle of experimentation. DII5 features a rainwater recirculation system that captures and reuses water for restrooms, easing pressure on local infrastructure.

Outdoors, the site has a bio-retention pond for stormwater, permeable paving and more than 2,900 newly planted saplings. There are also more than 90 plant species planted specifically to support pollinators, adding a biodiversity component to the industrial landscape.

Daniel sees the facility as a platform for learning: “At the same time, it serves as a 'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing and resilient in a changing climate.

""The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction and operation of our spaces.”

Scaling the lessons across Amazon’s network

While the Elkhart site is new, its impact is meant to ripple across Amazon’s existing and future facilities.

By tracking performance in real time and under operational pressures, Amazon is building a reference point for retrofits as well as new construction.

The company already uses mass timber in its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia, but DII5 is designed with a different purpose: finding which strategies work at scale.

Daniel explains the long-term thinking behind it: “While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future buildings design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing buildings portfolio.”

From EV infrastructure and water systems to lighting and material choices, the site collects data across dozens of touchpoints. That data will help Amazon understand how to reduce the carbon footprint of its entire logistics operation without slowing down fulfilment.

Kara underlines that operations haven’t missed a beat: “These solutions can be changemakers – and the beauty of this approach is, it doesn't impact our operations at all. Packages are being delivered with the same reliability our customers expect and we still get to test our sustainability initiatives.”

At DII5, Amazon is not only keeping its supply chain moving - it’s figuring out how to make every link cleaner.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ba9d63b9b3e769bb0963b8213e014e54:03227ffc75f56270b4708a62126f729f/testing1.png.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:01:52.762639

To provide more timely data, the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) created a methodology using more aggregated quarterly data to estimate quarterly investment, employment, productivity and GVA (gross value added) for the Industrial Strategy growth-driving sectors (the ‘IS-8’ sectors).

Quarterly data is inherently volatile, and the granular estimates are likely to see notable revisions once the official annual data is released. Revisions will be more significant where the sectoral proportions of the economy shift significantly. Estimates may also be revised as DBT methodologies and data sources improve over time.

Estimating quarterly economic indicators for the IS-8

The IS-8 cannot be precisely mapped and measured by official statistics. ONS economic data uses the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, which does not fully capture the detail and fast-changing nature of the IS-8, meaning coverage varies across them (see Table 1). See initial definitions for the IS-8 on the SIC, which we will continue to use as our starting point.

Table 1: SIC-based definition coverage across the IS-8

Advanced Manufacturing Clean Energy Industries Creative Industries Defence Digital & Technologies Life Sciences Financial Services Professional and Business Services Proxy SIC-based definition Not easily represented by SIC, with no or partial coverage Well defined by SIC Not easily represented by SIC, with partial coverage Proxy SIC-based definition Not easily represented by SIC, with partial coverage Well defined by SIC Well defined by SIC

The SIC system is tiered, with increasing granularity down from SIC-1 to SIC-4. Where feasible we have mapped detailed SIC-4 against IS-8 sectors. The higher-level SIC classifications (that is, SIC-2) lack the necessary granularity to map easily against the IS-8, so we have used a list of SIC-4 codes mapped against IS-8 sectors to extract economic metrics.

Clean Energy cannot be proxied at all under the SIC system and is not captured here. Defence and Life Science only have partial coverage. Thus, overall IS-8 estimates will not fully reflect all 8 sectors. Estimates are at the IS-8 sector and not the frontier industry level for all frontier industries outlined in the Industrial Strategy white paper.

**Coverage varies between ONS investment datasets so we use multiple sources and merge them together to give full coverage.

DBT is publishing estimates of these 4 metrics to have a more timely understanding of how the IS-8 sectors are faring. However, the relevant data sets are published at SIC-2 level, which is not granular enough to extract data on all IS-8 sectors – which are defined at SIC-4 level.

Financial Services and Professional Business Services can be directly mapped at SIC-2 level and is directly input to the quarterly summary figures. But where this mapping is not feasible at SIC-2, we use apportionment to disaggregate the SIC-2 level economic data to the SIC-4 level data using another data set that does provide data at the SIC-4 level (ONS’s Annual Business Survey or the Inter-Departmental Business Register).

For output per worker data, we use the sector GVA data calculated using the apportionment method and divide this by ONS productivity jobs figures. The apportionment for ONS productivity jobs uses the same method as the GVA breakdown, using the latest Annual Business Survey (Non-financial business economy, UK: Sections A to S, 2025). This keeps the methodologies for the numerator and denominator consistent.

We use 2022 prices for GVA, investment and output per worker because this is the Chained Value Measures base year in the ONS GDP low level aggregates dataset.

For more timely employment statistics, we use Pay As You Earn Real Time Information (PAYE RTI) to source monthly employment. We use the latest available Inter-Departmental Business Register data (2024) to source SIC-4 employment shares for the IS-8, which are then applied on to the latest monthly PAYE RTI data.

DBT will update these estimates in future quarters with historic actuals and new sector mixes when more accurate or recent data is published by ONS.

The high-tech drinking water treatment plant at Veolia’s Stanton, Delaware, location is so new that none of the 800,000 pounds of granular activated carbon has yet to be replaced. Granular activated carbon has become a go-to way to remove toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, better known as PFAS, and other contaminants from drinking water sources.

But when that carbon is overloaded with contaminants that it pulls from drinking water sources, the hope is the carbon can be “regenerated” for reuse in the same plant instead of simply being incinerated or dumped in a landfill. Recharging and reusing spent carbon within the same system is a potentially novel way of dealing with the byproduct created by removing toxic PFAS from drinking water, a contamination issue that has become a worldwide public health challenge.

“We’re always analyzing the best available technologies and seeing what we can use for that specific compound,” said Gayla Fecher, engineering manager for Veolia’s Delaware operations. She said time will tell how much maintenance the system needs, and how well reused carbon media will work to remove contamination like that posed by PFAS.

Veolia’s new plant, Fecher said during a recent tour, also was designed to adapt to future technological or scientific advances — whether that means retrofitting certain equipment or treating for a completely different type of contamination. For now the carbon’s main enemy to capture are elusive and ubiquitous PFAS compounds.

Exposure to PFAS has been associated with a wide range of health effects, including kidney and testicular cancer, impacts to liver function, thyroid interference, decreased birth weight, and more. They’re called “forever chemicals” because they bioaccumulate in the body and they don’t break down naturally in the environment.

Across the Delaware River watershed and beyond, private companies and public utilities have been racing to meet a 2029 deadline to meet federal “maximum contaminant levels” (MCLs) for PFAS in drinking water, to protect public health from those impacts. Because PFAS have been used so widely for so long, previous studies have found the manmade compounds in the blood of upwards of 99 percent of Americans, including newborns.

In April 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the first time set specific MCLs for a handful of PFAS compounds, which would require drinking water providers to regularly test for PFAS and remove any contamination above that limit. But just over a year later, the Trump administration announced plans to rescind a portion of that regulation and extend the compliance deadline to 2031. The standards for PFOS and PFOA, two highly toxic compounds that were phased out of production over a decade ago, would remain in place. Limits on three other PFAS compounds and a mixture will be reconsidered, although that updated rulemaking has not yet been announced as of September.

As for the 14,000-plus other specific PFAS compounds that exist, there are no established nationwide limits for safe drinking water standards.

“There is a proliferation of ever-more confusing structural types of PFASs,” University of Pittsburgh associate professor Carla Ng said during a recent SciLine webinar, pointing to the challenges regulators face in addressing emerging contaminants. “Part of it is because they find new uses, and part of it is because one thing gets banned, something else comes along.”

It is possible, though, that requiring treatment for even just two types of PFAS could inadvertently lead to the removal of some other known or emerging contaminants as well, since the activated carbon doesn’t care about federal regulations when it catches contaminants in its pores. However, experts note the shorter-chain unregulated PFAS that have replaced the “legacy” PFAS aren’t captured quite as well by the activated carbon technologies being widely implemented.

“There’s always this huge delay from the science to the implementation,” Ng said. “Cleaning up what has already happened is difficult enough, but the fact that we’re not stopping the new parts means we’re going to have to deal with that in the future.”

A First State first

On a soggy summer day, three members of Congress — Sarah McBride of Delaware, along with Chrissy Houlahan and Mary Gay Scanlon, both of Pennsylvania — visited Veolia’s new, $35 million water treatment plant in northern Delaware, donning crisp, neon safety vests and helmets as they walked through aisles of towering white tanks filled with over 400 tons of activated carbon.

As fans buzzed, the federal lawmakers huddled closely around Veolia’s head local engineer as she explained how the system works.

Fecher showed where water comes into the 17,500-square food warehouse, moving through a series of pipes connected to 22-foot-tall tanks filled with porous activated carbon. As the water percolates through the tanks, PFAS can be adsorbed onto the carbon’s surface. The water in those tanks can be screened for PFAS at different depths to calculate how long it might take to get the contamination levels as low as possible. Current standards of 4 parts per trillion — equivalent to about one grain of sand in an Olympic swimming pool — are nearly as low as detection levels can reach.

If you think of the PFAS contamination in the water being treated here as a “grain of sand,” Fecher explained, each grain of sand must filter through about 80,000 pounds of activated carbon. That’s a lot of porous material to pass through, and the idea is that enough contamination will be caught that PFAS levels are low enough to be “nondetectable” and therefore safe for human consumption.

Veolia’s facility came online in March 2025 and serves about 120,000 residents and businesses, and is capable of treating up to 30 million gallons of water per day. It took about three years to construct, company officials said. By the time state and federal regulators were finalizing PFAS standards, the team at Veolia was already working on a conceptual design of the plant.

Back in her office and out of the heat, Fecher drew a diagram showing how the use of two-tank systems at the Veolia plant will elongate the life of the carbon that’s absorbing those forever chemicals. The first tank will absorb more pollution than the second, elongating the second tank’s lifespan, she explained. Still, PFAS-laden carbon will eventually need to be replaced.

But the system was also designed to adapt to future needs, whether that means different types of PFAS — like emerging short-chain or ether compounds that may not be captured as easily by activated carbon — or novel types of treatment media, or potentially addressing another unknown type of contamination.

“We have designed vessels that would be able to transition to these new media types, to meet new regulations,” Fecher said. “And we also installed a new half-a-million-dollar permanent pilot testing asset that we intend to use from now into perpetuity.”

Fecher noted Veolia was very deliberate about the cost of the system, too. It was able to get the carbon media costs down to about half of what it originally expected.

A watershed-wide challenge

Veolia’s new plant is the latest of several PFAS treatment facilities in Delaware. At least 10 utilities across the state are already treating for PFAS. In New Jersey, where state regulations already require drinking water providers to treat for PFAS, officials said in August that the state has issued 116 permits to 84 water systems to specifically address PFAS under state regulations.

“Other treatment facilities may have been constructed previously to address other contaminants that also address PFAS, but that number is not readily available,” New Jersey regulators said. “As an alternative, some public water systems may have taken certain sources out of service or connect to other public water systems, in lieu of installing treatment, which would also reduce exposure.”

Regulators also said that PFAS “is prolific across the state,” and that public water problems often occur at small- and medium-sized systems that rely on groundwater for drinking water.

Officials with the Delaware Office of Drinking Water said the 10 public water systems in the First State that now treat for PFAS use either granulated activated carbon — the technology of choice at Veolia’s Stanton plant — or ion exchange, which relies on charged ions to capture contaminated material much like a magnet.

While Delaware may now be able to tout one of the largest treatment plants of its kind in the state thanks to private investment, it was nearby New Jersey that was the first in the nation to institute drinking water standards for PFAS. State regulators there also recently announced a $2 billion settlement with DuPont and other chemical companies for its role in PFAS contamination in the state.

Because it was the first in the state to both investigate and regulate the problem, New Jersey helped build momentum to address PFAS and also contributed to the growing body of scientific evidence needed to support drinking water standards in other jurisdictions, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.

“State action is really important,” she said. “States are often able to move more quickly than the federal government. When the EPA finalized its PFAS rule last year, it was the most significant new drinking water standard in a generation.” In fact, it was the first time the EPA used new authority under the Clean Water Act to update federal rules, she added.

“I think New Jersey is an example of regulation working,” she said. The state now keeps a database of utilities with PFAS violations. The database also tracks the year individual water providers came back into compliance, indicating that dozens of systems are already removing the contaminants due to the state’s regulations on PFAS contamination.

Large, publicly regulated utilities like the Philadelphia Water Department, which relies on three treatment facilities to provide safe drinking water to 1.6 million people, still have their own hurdles to face. Despite the state being ahead of the curve when it came to developing regulations for PFAS, the city is still piloting approaches — instituting an actual treatment retrofit is years away from the making.

It will also cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, said Matthew Fritch, the city’s watershed protection program manager.

“We’re pleased to have two extra years because for such a large utility, it’s harder to do that kind of thing. Smaller facilities can do that much faster,” he said of the proposed changes to the federal PFAS rules. He said that, based on what it’s seen from its first pilot study, Philadelphia will likely retrofit its two drinking water plants with granulated carbon technology in the future. But it’s still waiting on the first report from the first pilot study — after that, the upgrade can begin to be designed, financed and planned.

Luckily, though, the surface waters Philadelphia customers rely on from the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers contain low levels of PFAS, levels below the state standard. It’s the more stringent federal standard that two facilities will need to treat for. The third, which is the only one that pulls from the Delaware, doesn’t need additional PFAS limits because the chemicals are not found at detectable levels.

“We’re continuing to look for where PFAS is entering our system,” he said, noting that monitoring is ongoing throughout rivers, streams and other point sources. “The PFAS does come from somewhere.”

It’s not just a problem for publicly owned utilities, either.

In Pennsylvania, a recent study found that about 18 percent of private wells in the state are contaminated with PFAS. Unlike public utilities, private wells are not subject to regulatory oversight; officials in New Jersey and Delaware are also working with homeowners to address PFAS contamination in private wells.

According to EWG’s interactive PFAS contamination map, there are dozens of sites and utilities in the Delaware River watershed that report varying levels of PFAS contamination, from heavily contaminated military sites like Delaware’s New Castle Air National Guard Base not far from Veolia’s plant, and the former naval base at Willow Grove, Pa., to drinking water systems serving rural residents in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and beyond.

Researchers have estimated that it could cost between $24 billion and $55 billion to meet the 2024 proposed drinking water standards across the country. That’s just for upgrading the publicly regulated utilities.

In New Jersey alone, regulators have estimated it will cost the state over $1 billion to implement the new pending federal PFAS standards. Just monitoring the state’s roughly 1,200 water systems for PFAS is expected to cost $2.1 million annually.

“Importantly, this estimate does not include the sustained operational and maintenance costs that will be necessary for affected systems to maintain treatment,” regulators added.

The EPA has estimated costs at about $1.5 billion annually for monitoring, communication and treatment technologies, but also notes that benefits will be equally offset by preventing an estimated 9,600 deaths and 30,000 serious illnesses linked to PFAS contamination, including cancers, heart attacks and strokes.

Uncertainty in the regs

To offset uncertainty at the federal level, multiple states have adopted their own PFAS regulations. In Delaware, these state-level MCLs are the same as what was proposed at the federal level. But a new law signed by Delaware’s governor also aims to increase transparency into the process by requiring reporting of impacted water systems in the next two years.

“It’s a first get at trying to address the issue with all the uncertainty at the federal level,” said Delaware State Sen. Darius Brown, the Delaware Democrat who sponsored the legislation.

He said the bill was part of an effort to answer questions impacted residents continue to have after learning that PFAS contamination from the nearby air base had contaminated their water supply. An exposure assessment by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry found that PFAS levels in New Castle residents’ blood was nearly 10 times the national level, likely from drinking contaminated water. More than half of the participants had at least seven different PFAS compounds in their blood.

Another law previously passed in Delaware also helps regulate PFAS by recognizing several compounds as hazardous substances, allowing the state to tackle clean-up responses when contamination is found.

Nearby, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have long had their own state-level PFAS standards to rely on in the absence of federal regulations. However, those state limits allow for higher levels of PFAS contamination than the EPA’s 2024 limits. Even the EPA’s original health advisory limits of 70 parts per trillion were significantly reduced by the time the rule was actually made – to just 4 parts per trillion for PFOS or PFOA.

EWG’s Benesh said leadership at the state level is going to be key in addressing PFAS when the current administration seems to be rolling back previous rules. That can be done in part, she said, by incorporating PFAS oversight in ongoing state-level regulation of facilities that might be releasing chemicals.

As for funding the clean-up, there are government-based funding sources through revolving drinking water funds as well as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, not to mention legal remedies sought against polluters. However, some federally funded programs like state revolving funds are facing proposed cuts from the current administration.

New Jersey’s head environmental regulator recently told Inside Climate News that since the state first conducted water sampling nearly 20 years ago, it has found that “… New Jersey is, in many ways, ground zero for some of the worst impacts of PFAS” due to DuPont’s manufacturing history there. He, and many others, wants to see more effort to capture any contamination that’s still out there before it enters water systems.

As municipalities across the country race to add the technologies and find the funding needed to remove PFAS from drinking water sources, some experts suggest that a different regulatory approach altogether may be needed to address the growing number of types of PFAS, particularly the short-chain compounds that replaced legacy ones like PFOA and PFOS.

“I would say we’re making some progress that’s important in having regulations, but the chemical-specific regulation is really difficult to be effective because it’s one-by-one and something else is going to be manufactured,” explained Ng, the engineering associate professor from Pitt. “There are some state-based regulations that are more about ‘don’t put them into consumer food items’ or ‘don’t put them into makeup’ is much more health protective and much more effective than something that’s looking at a specific chemical when we have tens of thousands of these out there now.”",https://delawarecurrents.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_3633-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 07:00:33.166353

The warning comes ahead of a major auction where energy firms are expected to bid for plots of seabed on which to build new wind farms.

The Crown Estate manages all of the land and property belonging to the King, and provides revenue to the Treasury and the Royal Household. As the legal owner of the entire UK seabed outside of Scotland, it runs auctions to lease blocks of seabed to offshore wind developers, generating income from option fees and leasehold rents.

Greenpeace argues that the Crown Estate has exploited its monopoly position to charge hefty fees for leases of the seabed. It alleges that this has led to a pricing system that has massively boosted the estate’s profits, as well as the pay of its executives and the Royal Household’s official income, while driving higher costs for the wind power sector and energy bill payers.

The campaign group is calling for a review of the way seabed auctions are run and of the option fees that wind developers must pay. It argues that the current system risks loading unnecessary costs onto energy bills twice – both through higher option fees and by incentivising wind farms in Scotland, where fees are capped. As energy demand is higher in England, the power generated in Scotland sometimes needs to be carried south, and when that’s not possible, wind turbines are paid to switch off.

Greenpeace UK co-executive director Will McCallum said: “The Crown Estate should be managing the seabed in the interest of the nation and the common good, not as an asset to be milked for profit and outrageous bonuses. We should leave no stone unturned in looking for solutions to lower energy bills that are causing misery to millions of households. Given how crucial affordable bills and clean energy are to the government’s agenda, the Chancellor should use her powers of direction to ask for an independent review of how these auctions are run. If the problem isn’t fixed before the next round, we may need to let a court decide whether or not what’s happening is lawful.” [1]

In the first three auction rounds, the ‘option fee’ paid by bidders was capped. But in the fourth round that concluded in January 2023, the estate shifted to a price-uncapped competitive auction, leading to a dramatic increase in fees. As a result, the estate made over £1 billion in 2024/25 and its profits have skyrocketed, turning the seabed into its most lucrative source of revenue.

Meanwhile, King Charles’s official income will jump from £86.3 million this year to £132.1 million in 2025/6, almost exclusively because of the profits derived from offshore wind. At the same time, the Crown Estate Commissioner’s pay has risen fivefold from around £385,000 a year in the period 2015-2020 to a staggering £1.9m in 2024/25.

The legal warning from Greenpeace comes after a lengthy correspondence and a face-to-face meeting with the Crown Estate management. The campaign group is asking for an urgent review of the bidding process, and for the excess profits from the last auction round to be invested in marine recovery.

Writing to the Crown Estate Commissioners, Greenpeace has pointed out that the estate has a legal duty to both support the UK in meeting its climate targets and to remove the monopoly value from its seabed leasing. But in their reply, the estate’s managers have insisted that its legal duty is to maximise profit, not help the government deliver on its climate ambition.[2] This position appears to contradict what the then CEO of the Crown Estate, Roger Bight, told MPs about this legal duty in 2010: “So we are quite clear, it is spelt out that we cannot exploit our monopoly position.” [3]

ENDS

Notes:

Greenpeace’s threat of legal action was first reported earlier today in the Financial Times.

[1] Under section 1(4) of the Crown Estate Act 1961, the Commissioners must comply with the direction of the Chancellor or Secretary of State: “The Commissioners shall comply with such directions as to the discharge of their functions under this Act as may be given to them in writing by the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Secretary of State, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Secretary of State in giving directions to the Commissioners under this subsection shall have regard to subsection (3) above, and before giving any such direction shall consult the Commissioners.”

[2] The Crown Estate was awarded the rights to wind energy in the seabed in 2004 by the previous Labour government seeking to rapidly increase offshore wind. In the Crown Estate Act 2025, the current Labour government added an amendment stating: “Commissioners must keep under review the impact of their activities on the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom”. In their replies to Greenpeace, the Crown Estate rejected that they have a duty to support decarbonisation and cheaper energy prices, arguing instead that their duty is to “manage and turn to account the assets under its stewardship” (i.e. to maximise profit).",https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GP0STR2TD_PressMedia-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 06:59:30.010588

Benefits of load flexibility Implementing load flexibility strategies offers numerous advantages: Optimization across different loads: Balancing various energy demands leads to a more stable and efficient grid.","Over the next decade, utilities anticipate an unprecedented rise in load growth, driven primarily by widespread consumer adoption of connected devices—such as electric vehicles—and AI-related power consumption by data centers. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently noted rapid increase in electricity generation due to this soaring demand.[i] In fact, AI is on course to account for almost half of the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030.[ii] During the same period, greater energy price volatility and expanding need for ancillary services associated with the accelerated rollout of renewable resources are expected to increase the marginal capacity cost of electricity. These dynamics highlight the urgent need for enhanced grid flexibility, particularly through customer-owned resources.

Load flexibility refers to the electric grid’s ability to adjust and manage energy consumption patterns in response to supply conditions, thereby enhancing grid stability and efficiency. This adaptability is crucial, as it allows utilities to balance demand and supply, integrate renewable energy sources, defer capital expenditures on new capacity, and reduce reliance on peaker plants—which are often more expensive, environmentally detrimental, and take years to permit and build.

Importance of load flexibility

The significance of load flexibility lies in its capacity to:

Optimize grid operations: By shifting or reducing energy usage during peak periods, utilities can alleviate stress on the grid, preventing outages and maintaining reliable service.

Integrate renewable energy: Load flexibility facilitates the incorporation of variable renewable energy sources—like wind and solar—by adjusting demand to match supply fluctuations.

Support economic efficiency: Reducing peak demand can defer or reduce the need for new infrastructure investments, leading to cost savings for both utilities and consumers.

Strategies for enhancing load flexibility

The good news is that utilities have several strategies to choose from to enhance load flexibility. These range from using education and behavioral science to influence customers to act, all the way to implementing grid management solutions—like distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) to manage and optimize distributed energy resources (DERs) both in front of and behind the meter. These strategies include:

Behavioral demand response

Behavioral demand response (BDR) programs engage customers through personalized communications that encourage reduced energy usage during peak demand periods. These communications provide energy insights, tips, and prompts to help customers adjust their usage patterns. For instance, during a multi-day heat wave last year, PGE reported customer actions resulted in the largest electricity demand-shift in the company’s history.[iii] [iv]

Behavioral load shaping

Behavioral load shaping programs communicate with customers to educate them on time-of-use (TOU) rate plans, highlighting optimal times to use energy to save money. Providing personalized insights helps customers shift their energy consumption to off-peak hours, thereby reducing peak demand.

Peak time rebates

Peak time rebates provide monetary incentives for customers to reduce energy usage during critical peak periods. This approach has demonstrated reliable peak savings and increased customer satisfaction. For example, during a PJM emergency event in July 2025, Oracle Opower delivered 1,187,086 communications across email, text, IVR, and push channels. This supported three utility clients and helped customers take action when the grid needed it most.

Real-time optimization and DER management

Implementing real-time optimization techniques—such as Volt/VAR optimization and DER management—enhances distribution network efficiency and reliability. These methods involve demand management systems (DMSs) and DERMSs to automate adjustments to grid operations, improving safety and accommodating the integration of DERs.

Where to start

As the diagram below illustrates, these choices range in resource requirements to implement and the number of DERs they can involve in their forecasting and controllability.

Figure 1. Utilities can create load flexibility through a range of strategies and DERs.

Utilities who want to inject more load flexibility into their networks can implement programs and systems that best fit their generation mix and technology footprint. This means that they don’t have to do everything all at once. They can plan future options to align with their roadmap and forecasted demand.

For example, they can start by helping their customers act in ways that shift and/or reduce demand. Employing behavior change to add load flexibility is a “win-win for both the utility and the customer,” says Vanessa Richter, Energy Industry Solutions Expert, Oracle Opower. “These programs have low barriers to entry, increase customer engagement and satisfaction, and utilities get real results at scale.”[v]

Adding extra DER management and forecasting capabilities can align with utilities adopting advanced distribution management systems (AMDSs) and DERMSs, while also building on customer engagement from the behavior change approaches. The utility can then encourage these customers to participate in DERMS offerings with higher participation and program retention.

Benefits of load flexibility

Implementing load flexibility strategies offers numerous advantages:

Optimization across different loads: Balancing various energy demands leads to a more stable and efficient grid.

Co-optimization of front-of-the-meter (FTM) and behind-the-meter (BTM) resources: Utilizing all available resources ensures the most economical dispatch and operation.

Time-scale management: Effectively managing energy storage solutions, like batteries, allows for rapid response to demand fluctuations.

DER monetization: Enabling DERs to participate in different markets (capacity, day-ahead, real-time) creates additional revenue streams and reduces utilities’ system costs.

Value stacking: Leveraging DERs for both grid support and selling excess capacity enhances revenue and decreases utilities’ overall system expenses.

Load shifting and peak shaving: Adjusting energy consumption patterns reduces peak demand, deferring the need for new infrastructure investments.

Reduced cost of power: Accurate forecasting and demand management decrease the reliance on expensive peaker plants, leading to lower energy costs for consumers and utilities alike.

The bottom line

To summarize, “load flexibility reduces the cost of power and increases affordability,” says Arun Nimmala, Global Head, Oracle DERMS and OT Solutions, Oracle Utilities. “In addition, the ability to forecast across all types of DERs reduces the need for reserves and the amount of peaker plant generation, while creating new revenue streams in energy markets.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_77yILXkV1qNo30Q-x4e4BLjIr3I7m8xSnPzERINz68/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9zaHV0dGVyc3RvY2tfMjE5MzE5MDAwNS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-13 07:00:14.423520

“This voyage demonstrates that it is possible to operate the full coastal route with minimal climate impact,” he said.
Havila Voyages currently operates four ships using a mix of LNG and large battery packs.
He also suggested that stricter fuel requirements could be implemented immediately in future Norwegian coastal route contracts, based on the success of this biogas trial.","Norwegian cruise operator Havila Voyages is preparing to launch what it claims as the first-ever biogas-powered cruise along Norway’s coastal route.

The climate-neutral voyage is scheduled to depart Bergen on 30 November, covering a 12-day roundtrip along the scenic Norwegian coastline.

The vessel, Havila Polaris, will be supplied with 200 cubic metres of liquefied biogas at Polarbase near Hammerfest on 26 November, followed by an additional 150 cubic metres in Bergen. Combined with the ship’s onboard battery storage, the fuel will be sufficient to complete the entire journey sustainably.

Havila Voyages’ CEO, Bent Martini, highlighted the environmental benefits of using biogas in combination with the ship’s existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) system. “This voyage demonstrates that it is possible to operate the full coastal route with minimal climate impact,” he said. “The biogas will reduce greenhouse gas emissions for this trip by more than 90 per cent compared with conventional fossil fuels.”

The company plans to gradually transition its fleet to biogas-only operation by 2028, sourcing the fuel along Norway’s coastline to support local supply chains and jobs. Martini emphasised the importance of locally produced energy for both environmental and economic reasons, noting that it strengthens communities along the route.

Havila Voyages currently operates four ships using a mix of LNG and large battery packs. The use of biogas, he explained, offers advantages over biodiesel, including elimination of nitrogen and sulfur oxide emissions, improving air quality at the 34 ports the fleet calls at along the coast.

“While biodiesel helps reduce emissions, biogas provides an even greater environmental benefit, cutting both CO₂ and local pollutants entirely,” Martini added.

Trump’s decision to pull the US out of a global system for addressing the climate crisis could be the window of opportunity we were waiting for.
It must be made clear first and foremost that mitigating the effects of the climate crisis is an opportunity for innovation.","The climate crisis, Donald Trump told the UN last month, is “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”. With these words the US president rejected the international scientific consensus and evidence that we can all check daily with a basic thermometer. He has also announced he is withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015 by 195 UN countries. The US joins an axis of deniers including Yemen, Iran and Libya, countries that signed the agreement but never ratified it.

Paradoxically, Trump’s reversal provides an opportunity for others to advance the climate agenda: to sketch out the blueprint of a possible new world order without the US, even if Washington was the architect of the old one.

A new arrangement could even emerge at the UN climate summit, Cop30, in Brazil next month. Success will depend on the leadership capability of an unlikely duo: the host country, which is one of the founding Brics nations, and the EU, still the core political community in a fractured western alliance.

There is almost always a grain of truth in what Trump claims. He is not totally wrong when he accuses the UN of being toothless. As he said in his speech: “All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up.”

In 1995, Angela Merkel, then the German environment minister, opened the first Cop in Berlin, saying that global warming was “the greatest political challenge”. And yet, after 30 Cops and 30 years, the numbers seem to suggest that decades of “words” have produced only more hot air.

In 1995, global C02 emissions stood at 23.5bn tonnes; 30 years later, the level has reached a new record of 38bn tonnes. When Merkel tried for the first time to forge an agreement on gradually stopping the use of fossil fuels, 85% of total energy consumption came from oil, gas and coal. Today, that has only dropped to 80%. More worryingly, whereas we all accepted 10 years ago in Paris that the rise in global temperature must be kept well below 2C above preindustrial levels so as not to lose control of the “weather machine”, in Europe, according to the Copernicus observatory, we have already passed the 2.4C mark.

Clearly, we are failing. Multilateralism is in crisis and this may even be one of the reasons behind the appeal of populists such as Trump. But the rest of the world now has a (final) chance to show that “global” problems can still be solved collectively. Trump’s decision to pull the US out of a global system for addressing the climate crisis could be the window of opportunity we were waiting for. An opportunity somewhat like the one EU countries took advantage of in 2020 when they produced an unprecedented agreement on tackling the economic damage done by the pandemic. Consensus on issuing common debt was possible only because the UK, traditionally a sceptic on the matter, had removed itself from the EU.

But what exactly is to be done at the next US-free Cop? Some of the most difficult issues facing Cop30 risk getting lost in bitter negotiations: the “loss and damage” facility, for example, meant to compensate poor countries for climate-related disasters. Other discussions – such as that on the energy transition – seem paralysed by opposition from interest groups such as farmers, homeowners or European carmakers, who fear they will have to foot the bill.

The objective is still the right one, but the language, the metrics and the incentives must change. It must be made clear first and foremost that mitigating the effects of the climate crisis is an opportunity for innovation. The debate can’t permanently be about who bears the costs and who has the right to compensation. This is ultimately about an investment that will make our societies more resilient to global heating and less dependent on an energy model that is unstable and expensive.

No less important is the method we use to resolve such global challenges. The Cops, for instance, have a result/cost ratio which nobody could call “sustainable”. Do these conferences have to move to a different country every year? How about basing the meeting permanently in one or a small number of places, each focusing on a handful of specific challenges?

Perhaps it is time to refocus Cop’s mission: today, it involves diplomats negotiating frantically on the wording of a final communique, along with thousands of side events that have no impact on decision-making. It could instead focus on solutions to climate-related problems drawing on best practice globally, so that policymakers can identify how to scale up what works.

Two parties are key to the next Cop. Brazil, as the host country, needs a breakthrough. And the EU, which, as the part of the world most vulnerable to trade wars and no longer able to rely on the US, desperately needs new friends.

Brazil and the EU must come together around a pragmatic agenda. Alongside them should be India, Canada, the UK, Australia (the host of Cop31) and, yes, China. These seven may not be like-minded on many vital issues, but they still represent about half of the world’s emissions, population and GDP. I would argue that if they struck an agreement most of the other parties would follow.

The US under the influence of Trump and his Maga followers is missing in action and will be for the foreseeable future, despite sharing the same planetary and climatic conditions – including life-threatening wildfires and blizzards – as the rest of us. This is a grave mistake, but there is at least now an opportunity to shape a world that can function more efficiently without a hegemonic power. With the climate debate stuck at a crossroads, we must seize it.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/775f1cf985e5db35d1e46a7222d131ee0c43baae/0_26_3224_2579/master/3224.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c7348179655b69708f234572d0446b7c",N,,2025-10-13 05:59:44.489638

""Modern, industrial heat pump technologies are available and will soon be ready to replace thousands of low- and medium-temperature combustion-based boilers in the coming years,"" the ALA stated in its report.
""This transition can generate significant local health benefits by delivering cleaner and more efficient heat for industrial settings.
Educational efforts, policies, and investments in more efficient industrial technologies will yield major benefits for American communities and American manufacturers.""","A new study from the American Lung Association revealed the potential cost and health savings if U.S. manufacturers replaced thousands of industrial boilers with heat pumps.

According to the report, summarized by Canary Media, a gradual transition to heat pumps would save Americans $1.1 trillion in public health costs and avoid 77,200 pollution-inflicted deaths from 2030 to 2050. The publication explained that heat pumps use electricity to transfer heat instead of relying on dirty energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which contribute to the heating of the planet and health-harming air pollution.

States with higher concentrations of people living near industrial pollution sources stand to benefit the most, according to the analysis. Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina were identified as the states with the biggest estimated health benefits, with $107 billion, $82 billion, and $68 billion in projected savings, respectively. Twenty-three other states would save at least $25 billion each.

But heat pumps aren't just a solution for industry. Homeowners can implement these systems in their homes, which can save them money on utility bills. Heating and cooling are responsible for 60% of household emissions, according to Rewiring America, which adds that heat pumps are two to three times more energy-efficient than most traditional heating systems that rely on dirty energy sources. For instance, Mitsubishi, one of several companies that offer home heat pump systems, states that its devices are between 160% and 390% more efficient than gas-powered furnaces.

One other benefit of switching to heat pumps — whether at the industrial or household level — is that it cuts planet-heating pollution. Plus, this equipment delivers both heating and cooling in one package, and some heat pump users say these devices even distribute the heat in a way that feels more comfortable.

""I noticed … how different the 'comfort' feels compared to a regular furnace,"" one Redditor wrote. ""It's not blasting hot air all at once, but more of a steady, even warmth. Took me a few days to get used to, but now I actually prefer it.""

While it may seem overwhelming to find the right system for you, Mitsubishi can connect you with trained professionals in its trusted network who will help you install an efficient heat pump system.

The potential cuts come shortly after the Department of Energy announced nearly $8 billion in reductions to broader federal energy programs.

The potential cuts come shortly after the Department of Energy announced nearly $8 billion in reductions to broader federal energy programs. The affected projects include $50 million grants for direct air capture hubs, systems designed to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. One of these hubs, Project Cypress, is situated in Johnson’s district.

It remains uncertain which projects will ultimately be terminated or when official announcements will be made. Some companies participating in these initiatives have not yet received formal communication from the federal government regarding their funding. Christoph Gebald, co-CEO of Climeworks, a company involved with Project Cypress, said market rumors have circulated, but the Department of Energy has not issued a definitive decision.

Direct air capture technology relies on chemical processes to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The captured carbon can either be stored underground or used in industrial products, such as cement. Advocates argue that developing these hubs is essential, particularly in oil- and gas-producing states like Texas and Louisiana, where they could help reduce emissions while supporting local industries.

Economic and Political Implications

Louisiana’s Republican Governor, Jeff Landry, has publicly supported the state’s project and encouraged federal lawmakers to safeguard it from any potential cuts. Supporters emphasize the economic impact these initiatives could have, highlighting billions in investment and thousands of new jobs tied to the emerging carbon removal sector. Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, described the hubs as a “huge economic boon.” Similarly, Giana Amador of the Carbon Removal Alliance and Ben Rubin of the Carbon Business Council warned that withdrawing funding could harm local economies and undermine U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly growing industry.

Despite mounting concern from stakeholders, the Energy Department has maintained that its review of projects is ongoing. Spokesperson Ben Dietderich stated that no new determinations have been made beyond previously announced reductions, emphasizing that each project is undergoing an individualized review of awards made under the previous administration.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the review, confirming that potential grant cancellations are being considered across states, regardless of political affiliation. He stressed that the funding decisions are not tied to the current government shutdown and are not aimed solely at projects in Democratic-leaning states, countering claims made by White House officials suggesting political bias. “We’ve announced project cancellations before that in both red and blue states, and as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said.

The full list of funding decisions has yet to be released, but Wright indicated that details will be made public in the coming weeks. In the meantime, project advocates and local officials continue to lobby the Department of Energy to maintain support for these carbon removal initiatives, citing both environmental and economic benefits.",https://www.politicalfiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-2689109_640-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 04:00:02.139165

But other OCED picks garnered more public applause — and supported industries that President Donald Trump had flagged as priorities.
“These clean energy projects were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and represent the will of Congress,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, said in a recent statement to Canary Media.
A spreadsheet of the cuts lists 11 newly affected OCED projects totaling nearly $2.5 billion, including for two major hydrogen projects planned in the Pacific Northwest and California.
Additionally, the energy agency said it has started tapping OCED’s authority to make some new grants for Trump’s favorite energy source: coal-fired power plants.","The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was supposed to be a launchpad for ambitious projects to help America lead the way on cleaner power and manufacturing. Now it’s been reduced to a shell of itself.

As the Trump administration slashes spending and fires workers across the federal government, the U.S. Department of Energy has emerged as one of the hardest-hit agencies — and perhaps no other of its divisions has been singled out as deliberately as OCED.

It’s a dramatic reversal for the four-year-old office. During the Biden administration, Congress endowed it with nearly $27 billion to try to scale up cutting-edge technologies that could curbplanet-warming pollution from industrial facilities and power plants. Trump officials have in recent months hollowed out the office, canceling billions in previously issued awards for everything from low-carbon chemical manufacturing to rural energy resiliency, while also dismissing over three-quarters of its employees.

The situation is best summarized by the budget the White House has requested for OCED for the next fiscal year: $0.

Experts and insiders warn that the tumult within OCED and the DOE more broadly is eroding the private sector’s trust in the federal government and its ability to drive energy innovation.

“The administration has really created a chilling effect on the willingness of future early-stage technology developers to work with the Department of Energy,” said Advait Arun, a senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, a nonprofit think tank.

Ultimately, that will stifle investment not only in the clean energy sectors the Trump administration dislikes but in those it has championed as well, such as advanced nuclear and geothermal. Former OCED staffers and contractors, who were granted anonymity to speak freely, told Canary Media that the disruption is a major setback for America’s efforts to launch the world’s next generation of energy technologies and industries.

“We are eliminating ourselves as a leader in the clean energy space, especially for the industrial complex,” one person said. ​“What I’m seeing is China is about to slip right into that position. Just logically and economically, I don’t understand the steps that are being taken.”

The rise and fall of OCED

Congress created OCED in December 2021 to help deploy first-of-a-kind projects at commercial scale. The idea was for the government to absorb some of the risks and provide early capital to usher companies across the valley of death that lurks between promising research pilots and real-world operations that can move the needle on decarbonization.

The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law provided OCED with about $21 billion over five years to scale up emerging technologies like small modular reactors and long-duration energy storage, and to advance ambitious ​“hubs” for producing hydrogen fuel and capturing carbon dioxide from the sky and smokestacks. In 2022, Congress gave OCED an additional $5.8 billion through the Inflation Reduction Act to help decarbonize U.S. manufacturing of materials like steel, cement, and chemicals.

“A lot of this stuff is a chicken-and-egg situation, where the private sector doesn’t want to come in [and invest] yet because it’s not proven,” said Zahava Urecki, a senior policy analyst with the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Energy Program.

“But we need the technology to go through this [demonstration] process in order to make sure it becomes proven, so that eventually we can have this in society,” she added. ​“And that’s where the federal government plays a key role.”

Over the course of three years, the office selected 116 projects in 42 states to receive over $25 billion in federal funding. For most awards, participating companies were required to cover at least 50% of total costs themselves — meaning the office expected its portfolio to spur nearly $65 billion in private investment, in addition to creating potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Among the biggest winners were seven regional hydrogen hubs and two major direct air capture initiatives that would remove CO2 directly from the sky. The choices were not always broadly celebrated, and critics raised concerns that the hydrogen and carbon-capture initiatives in particular would do more harm than good for the climate by propping up unproven, energy-intensive projects involving fossil-fuel companies.

But other OCED picks garnered more public applause — and supported industries that President Donald Trump had flagged as priorities. In 2024, the office selected Cleveland-Cliffs for an award of up to $500 million to begin lower-carbon steel production in Middletown, Ohio, the hometown of Vice President JD Vance. Another manufacturer, Century Aluminum, got up to $500 million to help it build the nation’s first new aluminum smelter in decades, which would be powered by carbon-free electricity.

Former OCED staffers said they attempted to brief the incoming Trump administration on the office’s portfolio and to explain how they could support the president’s stated goals of boosting ​“American energy dominance” and ​“advancing innovation.”

However, from the time Trump took office on Jan. 20, ​“It became pretty clear that it didn’t really matter,” a former employee said.

It was quickly evident that Trump would, in fact, be adopting the right-wing policy platform Project 2025 after trying to distance himself from it on the campaign trail. The blueprint — which outlines ways to erase federal spending — called for eliminating ​“all DOE energy demonstration projects, including those in OCED,” in order to avoid ​“distorting the market and undermining energy reliability.”

For one staffer, ​“it all started crumbling” on Day 1, when the White House issued an executive order to halt federal work on ​“diversity, equity, and inclusion” — a measure that affected OCED’s grant recipients. Under former President Joe Biden, the office required participants to create community benefit plans to ensure the billions in taxpayer dollars went to projects that included neighbors in the planning process and supported local economies. Under Trump, the strategy became a liability.

A blitz of federal funding freezes and layoffs — and court reversals and injunctions — then ensued, creating chaos across federal agencies and for all the outside companies that hold or held government contracts. In late January, the White House extended federal workers a ​“deferred resignation offer” that would allow people to resign from their jobs and go on leave with pay through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Few OCED staffers initially took the offer. But after several months of chaos, about 77% of workers at OCED signed the deal when the White House extended it again in April. Insiders say that figure is likely even higher now. Across the DOE, some 3,200 employees within the agency’s roughly 17,000-person workforce opted to leave.

“That’s when folks at OCED actually started to realize it was going to be personnel changes that would first impact the projects, and not the program cuts,” according to a former employee.

Funding cuts, real and rumored

On May 15, about a month after the staff exodus, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the DOE would begin scrutinizing federal grants to ​“identify waste of taxpayer dollars.”

The agency started requesting additional information for 179 awards totaling over $15 billion, with a focus on large-scale commercial projects. Wright claimed that these awards were ​“rushed out the door, particularly in the final days of the Biden administration,” and required further review to ensure that individual projects were ​“financially sound and economically viable.”

Less than 3% of the over $25 billion in OCED’s awards portfolio had actually been paid to projects as of March 31, in part because larger grants were meant to be doled out in tranches over a long development timeline, according to EFI Foundation, a nonpartisan organization led by Ernest Moniz, who served as energy secretary during the Obama administration.

Project developers interviewed by EFI claimed that, contrary to Wright’s statement, OCED’s ​“due diligence was more rigorous than what private-sector investors would conduct” and that, rather than undergo the office’s laborious process, ​“faster decisions would have better aligned with developer timelines,” the foundation said in a June report.

Wright didn’t wait long to begin nixing projects. In late May, he announced the termination of 24 awards issued by OCED totaling over $3.7 billion, including funding for carbon capture and sequestration and projects within the office’s Industrial Demonstrations Program that aimed to reduce emissions from iron, cement, glass, and chemicals production.

“These clean energy projects were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and represent the will of Congress,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, said in a recent statement to Canary Media. Heinrich and other congressional Democrats sent a letter to Wright on Sept. 9 accusing the DOE of undertaking a ​“haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven” cancellation process.

More funding cuts arrived earlier this month, when the DOE said it was slashing 321 grants for projects almost entirely in states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. A spreadsheet of the cuts lists 11 newly affected OCED projects totaling nearly $2.5 billion, including for two major hydrogen projects planned in the Pacific Northwest and California. The October list also repeats five OCED-backed initiatives that first appeared in the May announcement.

Project developers have said they’re appealing the award terminations and are in continued talks with the DOE. Still, it’s unclear how much capacity the office has anymore to helm those discussions.

Wright said in an Oct. 3 interview that more cancellations would follow, and early last week rumors swirled about a second spreadsheet that appeared to outline deeper cuts for carbon-removal projects, hydrogen hubs, and other OCED projects. The nature of the list remains unclear, but if it proves to be a signal of cuts to come, it would cancel another $6.1 billion in awards from OCED.

The project areas that have yet to be cut — or to appear on any potential hit lists — include advanced nuclear energy and critical minerals. Additionally, the energy agency said it has started tapping OCED’s authority to make some new grants for Trump’s favorite energy source: coal-fired power plants. Should the office shutter, these awards would likely be managed by other divisions within the DOE.

In the case of cement and steel, demand for low-carbon materials is growing within U.S. and global markets as tech giants look to build less carbon-intensive data centers, and as state governments and European and Chinese regulators work to rein in industrial pollution. Still, losing grants — and the DOE’s seal of approval — will undoubtedly make it harder and more expensive for companies to raise private capital for commercial-scale projects. Stifling the DOE’s role as a gatherer and publisher of real-world lessons could further slow progress, Kizer said.

“The potential for breakthrough across different energy sectors is so significant,” he said of OCED’s work, noting that ​“a relatively small investment from taxpayers could have an enormous benefit to taxpayers over time,” in terms of delivering cleaner, more reliable energy. ​“Who says no to that?”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/DOE-Building-shot.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=83762acaa291f3014768c1b852f1b060,N,,2025-10-13 03:59:12.767018

Then this August the Trump administration announced that it would cut off $679 million in federal funding for offshore wind ports.
The move was part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attacks on offshore wind, the impacts of which are being felt far beyond the nascent sector.
There was no organized opposition to the wind port idea beyond occasional grumbling by Facebook commenters, she said.
When Trump was elected in 2024, some port supporters held out hope that the project would escape the president’s well-known hostility to offshore wind.","Barbara Kelley remembers when her car and windows were routinely coated with a thin film of coal dust that had drifted over from the power plant on the edge of her neighborhood in Salem, Massachusetts. She remembers the noise as a conveyor belt lifted the coal into the building. She also remembers how pleased she was when the community started to discuss the possibility of building an offshore wind terminal on the site when the plant eventually closed.

“The coal plant — it worked, it gave us energy, but it was time to change,” Kelley said. ​“My reaction was, having a wind port is part of having wind energy — and that’s a good thing.”

In the years since the coal plant shut down in 2014, Kelley and many other community members have worked to promote the goal of transforming part of the property into a staging ground where wind turbine blades, tower sections, and nacelles can be prepared for transport to offshore construction sites south of Cape Cod and north in the Gulf of Maine. The vision was to turn Salem Harbor, one of the country’s oldest ports, into a linchpin of the then-burgeoning offshore wind industry and provide an economic boost to some of Salem’s most disadvantaged residents.

Last year, that dream seemed close at hand. City and state leadership had embraced the idea. The state had promised a hefty investment, and the Biden administration had awarded the project a sizable grant. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the development in August 2024, and operations were expected to begin in 2026.

Project developer Crowley had agreed to pour nearly $9 million into a community benefits agreement that included job training, childcare, emergency services, and local sustainability and resilience efforts. Planners estimated construction and operations would create hundreds of jobs. And the whole process of bringing the idea to life gave community members a sense of agency and hope for their city.

Then this August the Trump administration announced that it would cut off $679 million in federal funding for offshore wind ports. The move was part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attacks on offshore wind, the impacts of which are being felt far beyond the nascent sector. Now, like those in so many communities across the country, the people of Salem find themselves facing the fallout of national political priorities, and wondering whether more than a decade of work will ever bear fruit.

“I feel like we’re all a little bit in the dark still,” said Lucy Corchado, a local activist who was part of the group that negotiated the community benefits agreement. ​“I hope we hear some good news, but I’m not sure that’s going to happen.”

The path to an offshore wind port

Community advocates first started floating the idea of building a wind port on Salem Harbor roughly 15 years ago. At the time, plans were underway to build a commercial wind farm off Cape Cod, and the coal plant’s closure looked likely. The advocates saw a promising future for the large industrial waterfront parcel in what seemed to be a growing energy sector.

Once the epicenter of the spice trade in early America, Salem has a deepwater port that today serves mostly recreational boaters, tourist outings, and the occasional cruise ship. Though the city is home to a hospital, university, and thriving hospitality sector, it also has a median household income well below the average in most surrounding towns and statewide.

When the owner of the coal plant proposed building a natural gas–burning facility on the site, activists from Salem Alliance for the Environment, or SAFE, were skeptical of replacing one fossil fuel with another. However, they decided not to oppose the plan for a new, smaller plant and to instead push for the rest of the property to be used for an offshore wind port that could both contribute to the decarbonization of the grid and create new opportunities for local residents.

“It wasn’t that we were really supportive of the gas plant, but we had bigger dreams of a wind port coming into town,” said SAFE founder Patricia Gozemba. ​“Our dream played out.”

In 2022, then-Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, announced the state would make a $75 million investment in the port, and the project was also awarded a $34 million grant from the federal Port Infrastructure Development Program. Two years later, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center bought 42 acres of the former coal plant property, with the intention of leasing it to energy and marine developer Crowley. The City of Salem acquired five adjacent acres.

The plans enjoyed widespread support in the city.

“We’re a uniquely progressive community,” said SAFE executive director Bonnie Bain. There was no organized opposition to the wind port idea beyond occasional grumbling by Facebook commenters, she said.

A seat at the table

As negotiations between Crowley and the city got underway, SAFE and other groups started to worry that, despite their longstanding advocacy for the project, important community input was missing from the process.

“This wasn’t just a wind port — it was an investment in the community,” Bain said. ​“We want to make sure that when we build projects that they enhance the community.”

Advocates raised their voices, submitting testimony for state and local proceedings, attending planning board meetings, and hosting educational webinars about offshore wind. In 2023, SAFE and several Salem neighborhood associations and civic groups formed a coalition to ask for a seat at the bargaining table as the city and developer hammered out the community benefits agreement.

The coalition was determined to make sure that the project didn’t harm nearby residents and created opportunities for some of the city’s disadvantaged populations. The group met once a week — Thursdays at 4 p.m. — for a year to discuss strategy, write letters to the media, and plan for local and state meetings. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo agreed to include two coalition members — Kelley, representing the Historic Derby Street neighborhood adjacent to the planned port, and Corchado, representing The Point, a largely immigrant, lower-income neighborhood nearby — in the community benefit negotiations.

“We kind of pushed our way to the discussion table to make sure they heard what we were looking for,” Corchado said.

The parties struck a deal that included a range of measures. The city’s public schools were set to receive $40,000 annually for technical and vocational education programs and another $50,000 per year to expand prekindergarten childcare to help parents attend job training. Crowley also committed to offer paid apprenticeships and internships, help graduating students find jobs in the industry, and fund scholarships for local workers to access relevant training opportunities.

When Trump was elected in 2024, some port supporters held out hope that the project would escape the president’s well-known hostility to offshore wind. Corchado, however, was concerned from the beginning.

“We were so far along and the funding has already been secured. It was like, maybe it’s not going to be that bad,” she said. ​“But, yeah … it’s what I was worried about.”

The news on Aug. 29 that the federal funding would be terminated was an enormous disappointment for proponents. It also left them with questions about whether the lost funds would scuttle the plan entirely, force the developer to change course, or merely delay implementation. Crowley will say only that it is reviewing the action and determining next steps. The city of Salem is also figuring out what to do now.

“We are still working to pursue all avenues to address the funding termination,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. ​“That includes working to get it restored or, failing that, looking at how we could revise the project plan to account for the loss of what was around 10% of the expected construction costs for the port.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Salem-Gas-Plant.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=bee66d785b2daea8e5b2bf997a7cdc04,N,,2025-10-13 03:59:23.513331

Despite the earlier-than-expected conclusion of EV tax credits, Aldred remains optimistic that investing in EV technology will still be worth it.","The electric vehicle market may face a bumpy road ahead, following the end of U.S. federal tax credits for new and used EVs last month.

What's happening?

On Sept. 30, the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and plug-in hybrids and the $4,000 credit for used ones expired. In a recent article, EnergySage took a look at what this could mean for the EV market. An objective, independent expert on all things solar, EnergySage helps consumers discover the right solar systems for their homes with its free, easy-to-compare quotes.

""The market is about to flip dramatically. … Expect a very different landscape,"" EnergySage wrote prior to the Sept. 30 deadline, citing several auto experts, including General Motors North America senior vice president Duncan Aldred.

""There's no doubt we'll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end September 30, and it may take several months for the market to normalize,"" Aldred said in a statement. ""We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won't overproduce.""

Why is this important?

The electric vehicle boom has benefited consumers in numerous ways. For one, drivers don't have to worry about paying high gas prices or shelling out money for oil changes. All in all, EV owners can save around $1,500 per year on fuel and maintenance.

Increased EV adoption has also contributed to cleaner, healthier communities, as EVs don't produce tailpipe emissions linked to childhood asthma, heart disease, and other complications.

Installing solar panels enables drivers to enhance these perks. Charging with a home solar system is significantly cheaper than relying on public charging stations or the grid, and photovoltaic panels don't release any planet-warming emissions when operating.

EnergySage helps the average household save $10,000 on solar installation by mapping available incentives in each state. Acting now could net you thousands in long-term savings with federal solar credits expiring Dec. 31.

If buying solar panels isn't in your budget, Palmetto offers leasing plans that require $0 down. Regardless of how you choose to go solar, electrifying your home provides further savings. If you're considering an energy-efficient heat pump, Mitsubishi has a variety of options.

What do changes to EV credits mean for consumers?

Despite the earlier-than-expected conclusion of EV tax credits, Aldred remains optimistic that investing in EV technology will still be worth it. ""We believe GM can continue to grow EV market share,"" Aldred said, per EnergySage. Recently, GM also announced a partnership with Pilot to bring more EV charging stations to rural areas and support coast-to-coast travel.

Meanwhile, drivers who want an EV may still be able to snag one at a favorable price point. Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying website Edmunds, suggested to CNN that manufacturers may start to lower prices, introduce better financing, or offer cash-back deals to move inventory.

""If you already can't sell the vehicles at current prices, there's no way you are going to sell them at today's prices with this credit going by the wayside,"" Drury said as the deadline loomed.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ev-dealership-1450302223.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 03:59:03.345748

Basu said it is ""part of a national effort to implement fast EV charging technology across India within the next five years.""","Researchers in India have developed new grid technology that could make fast electric vehicle charging more efficient and environmentally friendly, reported TechXplore.

The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has designed a multiport converter that plugs directly into the power grid. In simple terms, it bypasses the heavy, expensive transformers normally needed to step electricity up and down before it reaches a car.

Conventional high-powered chargers require multiple conversion stages, making them more costly and less efficient. ""Our invention simplifies this process and offers a 3-5% improvement in energy efficiency,"" said the corresponding author of the study, Kaushik Basu, per TechXplore.

""At a megawatt scale, this leads to energy saving, significant reductions in cost, and a smaller material footprint, which makes the charging stations environmentally friendly.""

The new converter design also allows for a compact charging hub that can both store electricity and send it back to the grid when needed, TechXplore reported. This ""two-way"" power flow means stations could keep cars running and also act as backup power sources during emergencies.

""We made the solution much smaller and more compact compared to existing solutions,"" said Harisyam PV, first author of the study, per TechXplore.

The innovation in India means stations could charge multiple vehicles at once, hook up directly to renewable sources such as solar, and even provide emergency power to places like hospitals during outages.

The breakthrough will make charging electric cars faster and cheaper for drivers while also enabling stations to operate more efficiently when multiple cars require power simultaneously. Because it wastes less energy, it can also lower pollution and reduce the need for heavy materials.

It comes at a time when other advancements in charging technology are taking shape, including solar-powered EV chargers, wireless charging, and increased battery storage capacity.

The researchers in India tested a prototype that delivered power at more than 95% efficiency, and they now plan to scale up to systems that can charge buses and cars together, per TechXplore.

Beyond EV charging, the converter could be applied to data centers, wind power, and railway systems.

Both developments are expected to come online before 2030, aligning with Australia’s national renewable energy goals.

Large-Scale Solar and Storage Projects

The Punchs Creek project, located near Toowoomba in southern Queensland, will feature a 400 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) facility co-located with a 400 MW / 1,600 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). Meanwhile, the Merino project, to be built near Goulburn in southern New South Wales, will integrate a 450 MW solar installation with a 450 MW / 1,800 MWh battery system.

According to EDPR, the Punchs Creek project is slated to reach financial close in 2026, with commissioning expected in early 2029. The Merino project is targeted to achieve ready-to-build status in the second half of 2026.

Support Under the Capacity Investment Scheme

Both projects were among 20 renewable developments selected under the Australian federal government’s latest Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) tender. The CIS provides a revenue underwriting mechanism that cushions developers against market price volatility - offering support if revenues dip below an agreed floor and requiring revenue sharing if earnings exceed a set cap.

EDPR Australia Country Director Simon Franklin insisted that the scheme provides “vital support” for accelerating new renewable capacity in the National Electricity Market.

Economic and Community Impact

Once operational, the Punchs Creek and Merino projects will collectively host around 1.5 million solar panels spanning 1,600 hectares. Together, they are expected to generate about 2.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) of clean electricity annually - enough to power roughly 380,000 Australian homes during peak demand periods.

Construction of the two hybrid projects is projected to create more than 1,600 local jobs, stimulating regional economies and supporting local businesses and service providers.

Expanding EDPR’s Australian Portfolio

The Punchs Creek and Merino developments form part of EDPR Australia’s growing 4 GW pipeline, which includes over 30 town-scale and large-scale solar and battery projects nationwide. The company described Australia as a key market with strong fundamentals for renewables and emphasised its strategic focus on hybrid projects combining solar, wind, and energy storage technologies.

The study announces a clear warning: humanity has entered a “new reality”, crossing the first of many Earth system tipping points, with coral reefs now irreversibly destabilised.

The report was published ahead of COP30, the annual United Nations climate talks, slated to take place in Brazil this year. The event is expected to provide a platform for global lawmakers, climate activists and leaders, congregating to shape a plan and agenda to tackle the planetary crisis.

INDIA'S PATH

India, ranked among the world’s top climate-vulnerable nations, must closely watch these developments. Multiple reports have emphasised that building climate resilience is now more cost-effective than reactive rebuilding after disasters.

The world's most populous country has also been flagged for approaching a groundwater depletion tipping point, particularly in regions where overexploited aquifers threaten agricultural livelihoods and food security.

As COP30 looms, the new report adds urgency to the demand for bold policy shifts, deep emissions cuts, and institutional innovation – without which the world risks facing a high scale of damage, which will only worsen with time.

“Only with decisive policy and civil society action,” said Lenton, “can we tip the trajectory toward a safer, sustainable future.”

CORAL REEFS TAKE THE HIT

The Second Global Tipping Points Report finds that warm-water coral reefs, providing a home to nearly a billion people and on which a quarter of marine life depend, are now passing their thermal tipping threshold.

Widespread damage is evident, and unless global warming is reversed, extensive reef systems may vanish, with only small refuges surviving, that too, under intensive protection.

“Warm-water coral reefs are passing their tipping point,” said Dr Mike Barrett, a co-author of the report. “ This grim situation must be a wake-up call that unless we act decisively now, we will also lose the Amazon rainforest, the ice sheets and vital ocean currents. In that scenario we would be looking at a truly catastrophic outcome for all humanity.”

The tipping point for corals is around 1.2 °C of warming – a plausible range is from 1.0 to 1.5 °C. With global warming already around 1.3 to 1.4 °C, the report argues that reefs are effectively doomed unless temperatures fall substantially.

LOOMING THREATS: ICE, FORESTS, CURRENTS

advertisement

Beyond corals, the study cautions that the world is close to other irreversible thresholds too – melting polar ice sheets, the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and the natural death of the Amazon rainforest.

On the Amazon rainforest, the report placed the threshold for widespread forest loss at 1.5 °C. It highlighted the urgency of the situation for the location housing a slew of flora and fauna and where COP30 is to take place in November.

Meanwhile, the AMOC, a vital ocean current system, is predicted to collapse under warming beyond 2 °C. If the particular threshold is crosses, the consequences would include disrupted monsoons, summer rainfall patterns, and global food insecurity.

SILVER LINING

Amidst dire warnings, the report highlights pathways to self-reinforcing transitions towards sustainability.

Already, tipping has occurred in sectors such as solar and wind power, electric vehicles, battery storage, and heat pumps. Coordinated policy action at “super-leverage points” could trigger cascading transitions across energy, transport, heating, and beyond.

“We’ve seen a radical acceleration in solar uptake and electric vehicles,” said Lenton. “But we must move faster and seize positive tipping opportunities, — if we are to steer away from chaos and toward a thriving, sustainable future.”

Brazil’s COP30 Presidency is collaborating directly with the report authors to place tipping points at the heart of the summit’s agenda. Ambassador Andre Correa do Lago, President-designate of COP30, said: ""The Global Tipping Points Report stands as hopeful and sober evidence that humanity can still choose to change and evolve towards a safe, prosperous and equitable future.""

HIGH STAKES

With the world's trajectory on course to breach the 1.5 °C limit, the authors argue that preventing overshoot — or at least minimising it — is crucial. Every decimal of warming and each year spent above 1.5 °C increases the chance of triggering catastrophic events.

The report also emphasises that abrupt, irreversible tipping points demand new governance models—current policy frameworks and decision-making processes are inadequate.

“Current policy thinking doesn’t usually take tipping points into account,"" said Dr Manjana Milkoreit of the University of Oslo and another co-author. ""Preventing tipping points requires ‘front-loaded’ mitigation pathways that minimise peak global temperature. Sustainable carbon dioxide removal approaches need to be rapidly scaled up to achieve this.""

The intellectual property owner decides at submission whether the ISA data package submitted will be made public and granted for third-party use.
ISA data packages should be submitted in accordance with the Procedure: Preparing data packages for the Index of Surveys for Assessment (ISA), which can be viewed on the Environment Online ISA guidance page.","Am I required to submit data to ISA?

If you are submitting a biodiversity or marine survey report to DWER, the EPA or DMPE to support an assessment, post-assessment or compliance process under the EP Act, it will need to be accompanied by an ISA data package that has been prepared according to the Procedure: Preparing data packages for the Index of Surveys for Assessment (ISA). The procedure can be viewed on the Environment Online ISA guidance page.

What type of survey data is captured by ISA?

ISA captures all biodiversity and marine survey data generated to support assessment processes or meet post-assessment requirements under the EP Act for the EPA’s Sea, Water and Land factors.

Does my post-assessment, ongoing monitoring or compliance process require an ISA data package to be submitted?

If there is a requirement for a biodiversity or marine survey report to be submitted to DWER, the EPA or DMPE for assessment, post-assessment or compliance purposes, it must be accompanied by an ISA data package.

If a biodiversity survey report was supplied to support approvals under the EP Act to demonstrate compliance with conditions of approval, such as Compliance Assessment Reports and Annual Environmental Reports, it needs to be accompanied by an ISA data package.

If conditions of approval require a post-assessment biodiversity survey or ongoing biodiversity monitoring, and submission of the resulting biodiversity survey reports to DWER, the EPA or DMPE, then ISA data packages must accompany these biodiversity survey reports. In cases where submission of such reports is not a requirement of approval conditions, the submission of ISA data packages is encouraged but is not mandatory.

Should I submit data associated with desktop studies to ISA?

No. ISA data packages are only required for field surveys that have generated new data. Studies based entirely on previously existing observations, for example desktop studies or consolidated reports, do not require ISA data packages.

If a study is based on a mix of existing and new data, for example a basic survey that comprises a desktop study and a site visit, an ISA data package should be supplied. This package should include the biodiversity survey report and the data obtained during the site visit, but not the existing data from the desktop component.

However, for marine surveys, data that is used to support models or other projections that are referenced can be provided.

I have a biodiversity survey report, but it is not related to an EP Act assessment or compliance process. Can I submit this to ISA?

It is outside of ISA’s scope to publish reports and datasets from surveys that were not conducted to support DWER, EPA and DMPE assessment and compliance processes under the EP Act. If you have a significant quantity of such information, please contact ibsa@dwer.wa.gov.au to discuss what options may exist.

Is all biodiversity and marine survey information provided for assessment automatically made public in ISA (IBSA/IMSA portals)?

The intellectual property owner decides at submission whether the ISA data package submitted will be made public and granted for third-party use. However, this information may still be made public for the purposes of an assessment or public consultation via DWER, DMPE or EPA websites under the EP Act. For more information, refer to the ISA Procedure and Data Licence Statement and Environment Online Terms of Use.

Records of species and communities contained in ISA data packages may also be shared with the Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, but public availability is subject to Dandjoo’s terms and conditions.

At what point during the ISA process are data packages made publicly available in the IBSA or IMSA portal? Can I amend a data package once it has been submitted?

Once the relevant agency has made and published its final decision or recommendation on the assessment, review or compliance process, ISA will make the relevant data packages publicly available, depending on the Data Licence Statement granted on submission. Until then, the data packages remain in an internal data environment for the purposes of an assessment or application. During the assessment or compliance process, the submitter can provide corrected or updated data packages if requested or there is a need to do so via the Environment Online portal.

Can I change my mind about making my data publicly available, or change the type of licence that I have granted, once my data has been uploaded to the IBSA or IMSA portal?

No. For technical reasons, the department is unable to amend metadata and licensing statements or process requests to change the public availability of data packages once they have been finalised and uploaded to the IBSA or IMSA portal.

No. ISA is not a relational database. If species names or other attributes change during an assessment or compliance process, the ISA data should be updated via the EO Portal or if a revised biodiversity survey report is submitted, a similarly revised ISA data package should also be submitted. Species names and status of ISA Records may be updated in the Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) Dandjoo Portal, where available.

How do I submit my reports and data to IBSA?

Clients do not upload data directly to ISA. ISA data packages must be submitted via Environment Online. ISA data packages should be submitted in accordance with the Procedure: Preparing data packages for the Index of Surveys for Assessment (ISA), which can be viewed on the Environment Online ISA guidance page.

If I am submitting an ISA data package, do I still have to submit data, such as significant species observations, to the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA)?

Yes. Currently, ISA data packages do not automatically feed into DBCA processes. Any requirements for the supply of survey reports and data to DBCA, for example where the conditions of a collecting licence require DBCA to be informed of significant species observations, still apply and must be adhered to regardless of whether or not an ISA data package has been submitted.

Am I permitted to submit information on threatened, priority and other significant species to ISA?

Yes. The goal of ISA is to publicly share biodiversity and marine survey data collected to support environmental assessments, which may include significant species location information. However, records of locations of significant species may be withheld from being made publicly available on advice from DBCA.

ISA data packages should include all species records, including those for significant species and introduced species.

Is ISA part of the Shared Location Information Platform (SLIP) or data.wa.gov.au?

No. SLIP and data.wa.gov.au contain curated, general-purpose datasets. Reports and datasets in ISA are not curated or consolidated. Individual ISA data packages can be accessed via the IBSA portal and IMSA portal, depending on the publication and third-party data use licence granted on submission.

Will all government agencies have unrestricted access to the data packages I supply for ISA?

Data submitted via ISA is done so in accordance with the State of Western Australian Government’s Open Data Policy.

However, currently non-public ISA data packages will only be available to the State Government of Western Australia agencies listed in the ISA Data Licence Agreement for the purposes of their respective Acts and Regulations. Requests for access to ISA data packages from other State Government agencies will be determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the purposes of the request, their acts, and the ISA Data Licence Statement issued.

Data packages that have been licensed to be made publicly available or for third-party use including all survey metadata, will be accessible to anybody – including government agencies. Therefore, government agencies will have the same level of access to information, the same options for acquiring datasets based on metadata and licencing granted, and the same conditions for using information that other ISA users have.

How do I access ISA data packages (e.g. biodiversity and marine survey reports and associated data)?

Go to the IBSA or IMSA portals. Browse the surveys or use the filters on the left, including the geographic filter, to find the surveys you are looking for. Note that the individual surveys displayed in the map, list and tile views, to the right of the filter panel, will be constrained by the number you have set to display per page (20, 50, 100 or 500).

Click on a survey title to go to the page for that survey. There you can view basic details of the survey under the ‘About’ tab, and see the metadata and licensing summary and any available reports and data files under the ‘Resources’ tab. Survey reports and data files will only be present if the intellectual property owner has licensed them for publication via the metadata and licensing statement.

How do I log in to the IBSA or IMSA portals? Are there fees for using it?

You do not need to log in to the IBSA or IMSA portals. Although there is a ‘Login’ button in the bottom banner, this is only for site administrators. IBSA and IMSA users can access all functionality without requiring an account or paying any access fees.

How do I search and filter the data packages?

The search box at the top right of the ‘Surveys’ page offers limited keyword searching. It searches only within metadata, i.e. titles, authors and the information under ‘Survey details’ and ‘Citation’ under the ‘About’ tab. Full text searching within reports and datasets is not supported. The search box is most useful when searching for a specific data package; refer to the question ‘How do I search by ‘IBSA/IMSA number’ for a specific data package?’, below.

The filter pane on the left-hand side of the ‘Surveys’ page offers limited filtering of results by ‘Receiving agency’, ‘Assessment type’ and ‘Author’. Only one filter may be applied per category. Click on ‘Refine’ to apply your selected options. Once a filter has been applied, the search box may also be used to conduct a keyword search within the filter results.

The ‘Geographic filter’ option is the most powerful and intuitive way of browsing IBSA data packages. Click ‘Filter by geographic region’ in the filter pane, apply a filter area using the popup box and click ‘Next’. In the popup box you can:

orient yourself by making the map full screen, toggling different base layers and overlays, searching for a specific location and zooming in and out

apply a custom filter area by drawing a square, circle or freeform polygon

apply a predefined filter area using the ‘Select a known shape’ button – options include bioregions and subregions, local government areas, Ramsar wetland regions and NRM regions.

How do I search by IBSA or IMSA number for a specific data package?

Each ISA data package is assigned a unique IBSA, IMSA or ISA number in the format ‘IBSA-YYYY-NNNN’. If you know the number for a data package you want to find, enter this number within double quotation marks in the search box at the top right of the ‘Surveys’ page. For example, if you wanted to find IBSA-2019-1234 you would enter “IBSA-2019-1234”. This data package will then be the first entry on the page of search results (this will not be apparent in map view – switch to tile or list view if necessary).

If you cannot find the data package you are looking for, remember that it might not yet have been published online; refer to the question ‘At what point during the ISA process are data packages made publicly available?’ in the 'FAQs – ISA requirements' section, above.

How should I navigate search and filter results?

If you perform a keyword search or apply a text filter, display your search results in tile or list view and navigate to an individual survey page, you will see a ‘Back to search results’ button on that survey page. Use this to return to the results of your search or filter.

If you perform a keyword search or apply a text filter, display your search results in map view and navigate to an individual survey page, you will not see a ‘Back to search results’ button on that survey page. Instead, use your browser’s ‘back’ button to return to the results of your search or filter.

If you apply a geographic filter and navigate to an individual survey page, do not use the ‘Back to search results’ button or your browser’s ‘back’ button. If you do, your filter results will be lost. Instead, open individual survey pages in new browser tabs, preserving your filter results in the original tab.

From any page, select ‘Surveys’ in the top banner to cancel all keyword searches and filters and return to the complete list of data packages.

How do I know whether I have permission to use reports and data I have found in the IBSA or IMSA portals?

Review Sections 3 and 4 of the metadata and licensing summary, under the ‘Resources’ tab for the relevant survey, by downloading it or using the online document preview feature. These sections show what type of licensing has been allowed by the intellectual property owner; users of IBSA or IMSA must adhere to the terms of these licences, as well as the general terms detailed in the IBSA or IMSA disclaimer. If you download survey reports or data files from IBSA or IMSA, you should also download the relevant metadata and licensing summary and retain it alongside the downloaded information.

Is the ‘Survey Area’, shown under the ‘About’ tab for a survey, exact?

No. This Survey Area boundary is approximate and is simply intended to facilitate geographic searching in the IBSA and IMSA portals and give a general overview of the area covered by a biodiversity survey report. If it is important that you know the exact boundaries of a survey, you should examine the survey details spatial dataset provided under the ‘Resources’ tab (if available).

I can't see the ‘Survey Area’ under the ‘About’ tab. What should I do?

The map viewer built into the 'About' tab for surveys on the IBSA and IMSA portals can sometimes behave unexpectedly. There is a known issue with the default display of the Survey Area map, particularly when the page length is less than the screen height. It will correct itself when you scroll down, but short pages may not be able to scroll down and therefore can’t auto-correct. If the map viewer is not showing survey boundaries correctly, please try:

updating your browser (note that the IBSA and IMSA portals are optimised for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome – they will also work on other browsers, but we recommend Firefox or Chrome)

removing or disabling browser extensions such as ad blockers

resetting the size of the browser window (e.g. by maximising then restoring it)

toggling different base layers in the map viewer (e.g. switch from the 'Road Map' base layer to the 'Satellite' base layer).",https://www.wa.gov.au/themes/custom/wagov/images/gov-wa-logo.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:08:37.160089

The BYD Camacari plant, built on the former Ford site, will begin producing 150,000 vehicles a year. It's expected to produce 300,000 units in the second phase and up to 600,000 units at full capacity.

The Camacari plant, with an investment of $980 million, is BYD's largest factory outside China. Its vehicles will supply the Brazil market and the rest of the Latin-American subcontinent.

According to BYD, eight out of 10 electric cars and three out of 10 hybrid cars sold in Brazil are BYD models, and the shares are expected to grow with the launch of local production.

""This factory represents the recovery of the dignity of the people of Camacari and the people of Bahia. This is sovereignty and dignity,"" Lula said at the inauguration.

Lula said that what has come after Ford's departure will be much better, as the Chinese project also includes technological transformation.

""What we want is a civilized relationship with the world; that is why we defend multilateralism,"" the president said.

BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu highlighted Brazil's advantages as a production site.

""Brazil has unique and abundant clean energy resources, an open and diverse society, and citizens willing to embrace new technologies. In addition, the government launched the New Industry Brazil plan, focused on innovation and green transition, creating ideal conditions. Brazil is a leader in the green transformation,"" Wang said.

BYD Brazil President Tyler Li told China Daily how BYD will optimize Brazil's natural advantages.

""One of the company's missions is to renew the industrial base and make Brazil a leading player in the global energy transition. In addition to this industrial investment, we allocated $12 million to research and development,"" said Li.

""As a green tech committed to innovation, industrial scale and environmental respect, we are developing solutions that reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Among them, we highlight the hybrid flex engine, the result of a partnership between Chinese and Brazilian scientists,"" Li continued.

According to Li, BYD focuses on electric bus chassis production.

""We have innovated batteries that combine durability, safety and low environmental impact. We continue to develop solar photovoltaic generation projects, set up ultra-fast charging infrastructures that connect major urban and logistics corridors — an essential feature for buses and trucks,"" Li said.

Li said BYD is also participating in Sao Paulo's Metro Line 17-Gold project, which integrates heavy, low-carbon urban mobility.

Bahia's Secretary of Economic Development Angelo Almeida said BYD's arrival represents the rebirth of Camacari's automotive hub, generating employment, income and innovation.

""The company began production with semi-assembled vehicles and will advance to full production in the second half of 2026. This will create a value chain of maintenance, logistics, food and security. It is projected to bring in 10,000 direct jobs alone,"" Almeida said.

Bahia is home to the Senai Cimatec Park Development and Technology Center, with more than 1,500 professionals working in research and development for electric, connected and autonomous vehicles. Almeida said BYD may push the state's industry toward green technology production by leveraging the local research system.

""BYD has already expressed its intention to establish an Automotive Research and Innovation Center in the Salvador Metropolitan Region. This could consolidate the state as a reference hub for electric mobility, automotive software and electric propulsion system development,"" Almeida said.

Investors are weighing rapid growth prospects against concerns about rising valuations.

Bloom Energy’s latest buzz is part of a much wider rally. Over the past year, the company has delivered a staggering 708.85% total shareholder return, fueled by its AI-driven clean energy solutions and fresh high-profile partnerships. Even after a 29.16% one-month share price gain and recent announcements about doubling manufacturing capacity, momentum is still building as investors weigh technology leadership against already lofty valuations.

If you’re watching this surge and wondering what other innovation-led stocks might be setting the pace, broaden your search and discover

So after such a dramatic run, is Bloom Energy’s rapid growth story fully reflected in today’s share price? Alternatively, could the next earnings report reveal a fresh buying opportunity for investors before markets price in even more future gains?

Most Popular Narrative: 50.7% Overvalued

Bloom Energy's widely followed narrative assigns a fair value well below the last close price, highlighting high growth assumptions that need to materialize to support today’s valuation.

Widespread grid constraints and long interconnection timelines for traditional utility-scale power create a time-to-power advantage for Bloom's solutions. This boosts its competitive edge in mission-critical markets and is expected to expand the company's addressable market, positively impacting future top-line growth.

Curious how much future revenue has to surge for this high valuation to stick? The boldest financial projections drive the case, but few know all the details. Want to see exactly which growth assumptions are fueling this figure? You might be surprised by just how aggressive the narrative gets on margins and earnings over the next three years.

Result: Fair Value of $57.63 (OVERVALUED)

However, rapid advances in zero-emissions technologies or setbacks in Bloom's cost control could quickly challenge even the most bullish growth assumptions.

Another View: What Does Our DCF Model Say?

Looking at our DCF model, Bloom Energy’s shares appear to be trading slightly below fair value, with the current price at $86.87 compared to our estimate of $90.67. While this suggests modest upside, the margin is tight and raises questions about how much safety investors really have at this level. What could tip the balance next?

As the global population surges and energy demand rises, protecting nature is not just an environmental imperative, but a social and economic one too. That’s because more than half of global GDP – approximately $58 trillion – is directly or indirectly dependent on nature.

With the world’s population projected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, the path forward is not less energy or slower development but a smarter, pragmatic approach. This is because expanding access to affordable, reliable energy remains essential to human progress. This, however, must be squared with the world’s collective responsible for safeguarding nature and biodiversity.

At Adnoc, we assess and manage nature-related risks and opportunities alongside financial and climate considerations in keeping with the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. We embed nature into strategic planning and investment decisions and this thinking is at the heart of Adnoc’s Hail and Ghasha, the world’s largest gas development of its kind that aims to operate with net-zero emissions.

Located within Abu Dhabi’s Unesco-designated Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve, this energy project is expected to produce more than 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day of gas before the end of the decade, enough gas to cover the daily needs of Ireland, Greece and Portugal combined. It will also capture 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually for safe underground storage, produce low-carbon hydrogen to replace fuel gas and draw power from the UAE’s clean energy grid, fed by nuclear and solar.

Hail and Ghasha will not only operate responsibly, producing more energy with fewer emissions, it will also do so while ensuring sustainable use of the natural area.

That’s because the Marawah Reserve hosts extraordinarily diverse marine and coastal ecosystems. It’s rich in seagrass meadows that sustain the world’s second-largest population of dugongs, and is home to coral reefs, mangroves, ospreys, turtles and countless fish species.

To protect this biodiversity, Adnoc, together with the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi, conducted one of the largest marine environmental baseline surveys in the UAE’s history. By mapping habitats in unprecedented detail, we were able to carefully optimise well locations and trajectories, ensuring construction and drilling activities avoid sensitive areas.

The findings were integrated into a biodiversity monitoring programme which now guides every stage of Hail and Ghasha’s development. It informed initiatives such as building hundreds of nesting platforms for ospreys, deploying artificial coral reef structures and fish domes for marine biodiversity, and creating a rescue and rehabilitation programme for sea turtles, supported by education and research partnerships.

Efforts also extend to large-scale habitat restoration as we are committed to planting one million mangroves during the project’s lifecycle, under our broader pledge to plant 10 million mangroves by 2030.

When I think about Hail and Ghasha in the context of today’s competing priorities to simultaneously meet rising energy demand without neglecting our collective desire to create a world our children would be proud of, three lessons stand out.

The first is that large-scale industrial projects can be responsible by design. With foresight and investment, they can channel new resources, investment and expertise into critical developments that help to build environmental resilience.

Second is that we should see development capital as conservation capital. By embedding biodiversity and emissions-reduction measures into flagship energy projects, we can scale investment in conservation.

And finally, energy security and environmental stewardship can be mutually reinforcing – they do not need to be mutually exclusive. As the UAE’s population rises (one only needs to read The National to note that Abu Dhabi’s population soared to 4.1 million people last year) energy demand will rise too.

By aligning that goal with decarbonisation and the continued transformation of energy systems, industries can demonstrate how sustainable development does indeed create a clear and pragmatic pathway to multiply conservation impact.

Ever since the UAE’s first oil discovery in 1958, energy has been not only a commodity, but a driver for social and economic progress.

Its profit may have been boosted by the surge in US EV sales ahead of the end of a US$7,500 federal tax credit in September, analysts said.

LGES warned in July of a further slowdown in EV demand by early next year due to the elimination of the tax credits as well as US import tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration.

LGES shares were up 1.5 per cent in a wider market that was down 1.4 per cent.

The company would have made a 236 billion won operating profit excluding US battery manufacturing incentives it received under the US Inflation Reduction Act, the company said in a regulatory filing.

LGES will release detailed earnings on Oct 30.

Energy storage, Georgia raid

LGES has tried to boost production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset sluggish EV demand and improve profits in the second half of this year.

The company has signed a US$4.3 billion deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, as the US automaker looks to reduce reliance on Chinese imports due to tariffs.

In September, LGES suffered a setback with its joint battery factory with Hyundai Motor in the United States. Construction has been suspended in the wake of an immigration raid on the Georgia facility in early September that led to the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers.

Hyundai Motor CEO Jose Munoz said last month that the factory was facing a minimum startup delay of two to three months after the raid.

LGES said early this month that it would gradually resume US business trips for its employees and subcontractors, a day after the Trump administration agreed to allow South Koreans to work on equipment at US sites under existing temporary visas.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Global warming is crossing dangerous thresholds sooner than expected with the world’s coral reefs now in an almost irreversible die-off, marking what scientists on Monday described as the first “tipping point” in climate-driven ecosystem collapse.

The warning in the Global Tipping Points report by 160 researchers worldwide, which synthesizes groundbreaking science to estimate points of no return, comes just weeks ahead of this year's COP30 climate summit being held at the edge of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.

That same rainforest system is now at risk of collapsing once the average global temperature warms beyond just 1.5 degrees Celsius based on deforestation rates, the report said, revising down the estimated threshold for the Amazon.

Also of concern if temperatures keep rising is the threat of disruption to the major ocean current called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, which helps to ensure mild winters in northern Europe.

“Change is happening fast now, tragically, in parts of the climate, the biosphere,” said environmental scientist Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, who is the lead author of the report.

SOME POSITIVE SIGNS

Lenton noted positive signs when it came to phasing out the fossil fuels most responsible for climate change. Renewables, for example, accounted for more electricity generation than coal this year for the first time, according to data from the nonprofit think tank Ember.

“Nobody wants to be just traumatized and disempowered,” Lenton said. “We still have some agency.”

The scientists implored countries at November's COP30 to work toward bringing down climate-warming carbon emissions.

Scientists have been surprised by how quickly changes are unfolding in nature, with average global temperatures already having warmed by 1.3-1.4 degrees Celsius (2.3 to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above the preindustrial average, according to data from U.N. and EU science agencies.

WARMEST ON RECORD

The last two years were Earth’s warmest on record, with marine heatwaves that stressed 84% of the world’s reefs to the point of bleaching and, in some cases, death. Coral reefs sustain about a quarter of marine life.

For corals to recover, the world would need to drastically ramp up climate action to reverse temperatures back down to just 1 degree C above the preindustrial average, the scientists suggested.

“The new report makes clear that each year there is an increase in the scope and magnitude of the negative impacts of climate change,” said Pep Canadell, a senior scientist at Australia’s CSIRO Climate Science Centre.

EMNRD News:

State grants will go to public entities, including cities, school districts & tribes

SANTA FE – The New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) is now accepting grant applications from public entities that can demonstrate how new technologies can be harnessed to develop a reliable, modern electric grid.

The grant funding comes from the Community Benefits Fund the State Legislature created during its 2025 legislative session. The legislature allocated $70 million from the Community Benefit Fund to the Grid Modernization Program administered by EMNRD Energy Conservation and Management Division (ECAM).

“This Grid Modernization Grant Fund infusion is a game-changer for New Mexico’s ability to find innovative ways of strengthening our electric grid and building long-term resilience for our communities,” ECAM Director Rebecca “Puck” Stair said. “At the exact time the federal government is cancelling grants for projects designed to improve energy infrastructure, New Mexico is leaning in with record state funding for grid mod.”

Grid modernization projects are expected to upgrade electric distribution or transmission infrastructure to accommodate integration of renewable electricity sources or otherwise make the grid more efficient, reliable and secure and better able to respond to expected growth in energy demand.

ECAM is seeking to award grant funds to three types of projects:

Projects that involve construction, installation, operation and verification of functioning modern grid technology at a project site.

Projects consisting of pre-construction or design activities that would eventually result in the building and installation of fully functional modern grid technology.

Original research projects that advance the state’s understanding and appreciation of grid function, reliability, resilience, security and operation relating to the integration of renewable and zero-carbon resources, including impacts on customer behavior, operations and maintenance costs or the value of specific grid technologies.

By law, eligible applicants include municipalities and county governments; state agencies; public schools; state universities and other post-secondary education institutions; and Native American nations, tribes, and pueblos. All projects must take place within New Mexico.

The trends suggested by the report, published last week, may not be conclusive enough to rule out the influential hypothesis that the increasing deployment of clean energy will not necessarily lead to a decline in fossil fuel use over the long-term. Yet, the marginal difference — barely 1 per cent — between polluting and non-polluting sources of power is encouraging because renewables have made inroads amid a growing appetite for electricity in a world roiled by geopolitical crises that have deeply impacted the energy market. The report highlights that record solar-power generation and a steady expansion of wind energy helped renewables keep pace with the increasing demand for electricity to power traditional industrial units, keep buildings cool in the face of rising temperatures, drive electric vehicles, and operate new sources of economic activity, such as data centres.

The fine print of the Ember report, however, reveals both positives and negatives. Much of the growth in clean energy has come in China, where a growing fleet of solar-powered stations has outpaced coal energy plants. In India too, the clean-energy graph is headed northward, and the country is on course to become the second-largest renewables market by 2030. In several developing countries in Asia and Africa, policies that encourage the development of green-technology solar power have driven a climate-friendly energy transition. The outlook, however, is not that rosy in most parts of the developed world. In Europe, poor wind conditions and drought precipitated a more than 14 per cent rise in fossil-fuel electricity generation, reminding policymakers that much needs to be done to mitigate the precarity of renewable energy. In the US, clean-energy policies have hit a roadblock, largely because of President Donald Trump’s climate denialism and his strident advocacy of fossil fuels. In July, the Congress voted to phase out the tax credit support for wind and solar power. The International Energy Agency has lowered America’s renewable capacity growth expectations by 50 per cent compared to last year. The agency reckons that the attainment of its global target for 2030 will largely depend on how developed countries overcome the recent barriers to climate adaptation.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/10/express-view-Copy-2-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 02:59:02.587604

The money would be used to hire a firm to create a report on the subject.

A working group of Oklahoma researchers and utilities has been assembled to gather information ahead of the study. The OCC partnered with the Hamm Institute for American Energy and identified nuclear energy experts from the University of Oklahoma.

The participants are working as volunteers, said Mark Argenbright, director of the OCC's public utility division. He said Enercon Services, which completed Michigan's nuclear feasibility study, is among the potential companies eyed for the task.

The request comes as the agency reports funding challenges and staffing shortages.

"" We're unable to fill them because we cannot pay the salaries commensurate to draw people to these jobs,"" Commissioner Todd Hiett said. ""And so, we're already cutting and operating very thinly already, and maybe to the legislature, a couple hundred thousand dollars doesn't sound like much, but in our world, that's quite a bit.""

The agency could continue its information gathering without hiring a firm, though Argenbright said the product wouldn't be as comprehensive.

"" We'll create a report regardless of how we deal with the consultant issue,"" he said. ""But it will be at a different level than it would be with a consultant, where we would have a much deeper dive and a broader range of information that would be able to bring to bear on the report.""

The agency could also use money pulled from its assessment fees of utility companies. Chairman Kim David said that the option would result in higher costs for Oklahoma utility customers.

"" I'd like to make a motion that we requested supplemental appropriation for the $125,000 for the report and put it back in their lap,"" David said of the state legislature. ""We have a lot of different people that have given a lot of time and effort and energy into this.""

In response to Hiett voicing support for completing a study that the state can one day use, Commissioner Brian Bingman said the OCC should continue its report without hiring a third-party firm.

"" I kind of disagree because I just don't think the legislature is serious about this,"" he said.

Yes, please Eligible businesses can receive rebates of up to $34,300 on a commercial solar system.
One example highlighted in the announcement is a 99 kW system installed on a winery, saving around $22,000 every year.
More than a financial incentive Victoria’s new commercial solar rebates are more than a financial incentive.
Commercial solar just graduated from “nice idea” to “strategic necessity” – and Victoria has made the decision easier than ever.","For years, solar rebates have focused heavily on households. Meanwhile, large energy-using businesses were left sitting on prime rooftop real estate with little support to tap into it. That gap has finally been addressed. Victoria has introduced a new commercial solar rebate program designed specifically for big energy users, opening the door for factories, warehouses, supermarkets, and other commercial operations to slash bills and boost sustainability.

This isn’t just another small incentive. It’s a game-changing shift that could transform how businesses manage energy, improve profitability, and accelerate the state’s clean energy goals.

Why businesses should care

Electricity is one of the biggest overheads for commercial and industrial operators. These sites chew through almost a third of Victoria’s total energy use. Until now, there were limited funding options for solar at this scale. Residential rebates capped out too low, and large-scale funding didn’t apply.

This rebate targets the “missing middle” – systems between 30 kW and 200 kW. In other words, the exact size range used by commercial sites with high daytime energy demand. By focusing on where the energy is actually being used, Victoria is unlocking massive savings potential for businesses.

Up to $34,300 off installation? Yes, please

Eligible businesses can receive rebates of up to $34,300 on a commercial solar system. That’s a serious chunk off the upfront cost, reducing financial barriers and significantly cutting payback time.

Here’s why that matters: a 200 kW system can produce around 600 kWh per day. That level of generation can deliver between $64,000 and $68,000 in annual electricity bill savings. With a rebate on top, the return on investment becomes incredibly attractive.

Solar officially stops being “a nice idea” and starts being “a no-brainer business strategy”.

Who can take advantage?

There are tens of thousands of businesses across Victoria with the rooftop space to install 30 kW to 200 kW systems. The scheme is designed for energy-intensive operations such as:

Manufacturing

Warehousing and logistics

Food and beverage processing

Retail hubs and supermarkets

Large commercial offices

If you operate during daylight hours and pay high bills, this incentive has your name on it.

Better yet, businesses installing solar within the eligible size range will also be able to claim Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs), further lowering costs. And if they want to go a step further, battery rebates may also apply through a separate federal program, creating the option of full energy independence.

From cost centre to profit centre

Solar isn’t just about sustainability anymore – it’s a competitive advantage. Lowering energy costs improves margins, increases pricing flexibility, and frees up capital for growth.

With this rebate in play, solar becomes a strategic business move. It helps organisations future-proof against rising energy prices, build resilience, and increase asset value. It even sends a positive signal to customers, investors, and suppliers who increasingly expect sustainability leadership.

And then there’s supply chain pressure. Larger corporations are now demanding lower emissions from their suppliers. This rebate makes it far easier for smaller operators to stay in the game by decarbonising affordably.

Real-world results already happening

This isn’t just theoretical. Commercial solar is already proving its value. One example highlighted in the announcement is a 99 kW system installed on a winery, saving around $22,000 every year. That’s a near-instant increase in profit without selling a single extra bottle.

Now imagine that kind of benefit scaled across thousands of sites. We’re talking tens of millions in savings across the Victorian economy – every single year.

Quality and safety baked in

To ensure installations meet the highest standards, businesses must use Clean Energy Council-approved solar modules. With nearly 3,000 approved products available, there’s no shortage of options. This requirement protects system performance, supports system longevity, and reduces maintenance headaches.

It also protects reputations. No business wants its sustainability story ruined by poor-quality hardware.

The bigger picture: decarbonisation through business leadership

While households have carried much of the solar adoption load, commercial and industrial buildings have far greater potential. They have bigger roof space, bigger energy consumption, and bigger savings.

This rebate signals a clear shift in energy policy: if we want real emissions reductions, we need the commercial sector on board.

By targeting the right size range, Victoria is unlocking emissions reductions at scale without waiting for massive solar farms or complex infrastructure upgrades. It’s smart, practical, and immediately impactful.

Things to consider before diving in

Like any major investment, businesses should plan carefully. Key considerations include:

Network connection approvals

Structural roof assessments

Energy load analysis to maximise self-consumption

Optional battery or demand management strategies

Working with trusted, accredited installers

The right installer will guide businesses through approvals and system design to ensure the best long-term outcome.

Time to move, early adopters will win

Rebates rarely last forever. Early adopters are likely to secure the largest benefits, while latecomers risk missing out or facing longer approval wait times as demand surges.

For businesses with high energy bills, these rebates offer a rare opportunity to turn sunlight into serious savings. Instead of sending money to the grid every month, businesses can invest in their own energy infrastructure and keep those dollars in-house.

More than a financial incentive

Victoria’s new commercial solar rebates are more than a financial incentive. They level the playing field, reward efficiency, and give businesses the tools to take control of their energy future.

Energy independence. Lower bills. Stronger sustainability credentials. Better cash flow.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Battery maker LG Energy Solution (LGES) said on Monday its third-quarter operating profit likely rose 34% as U.S. consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles to take advantage of government incentives that expired on September 30.

The South Korean company, which supplies EV batteries to General Motors and Tesla, estimated its operating profit was 601 billion won ($420 million) during the July to September period, up from 448 billion won in profit a year earlier.

The preliminary figure beat a 528 billion won profit forecast compiled by LSEG SmartEstimate that was weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

Its profit may have been boosted by the surge in U.S. EV sales ahead of the end of a $7,500 federal tax credit in September, analysts said.

LGES warned in July of a further slowdown in EV demand by early next year due to the elimination of the tax credits as well as U.S. import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump’s administration.

LGES shares were up 1.5% in a wider market that was down 1.4%.

The company would have made a 236 billion won operating profit excluding U.S. battery manufacturing incentives it received under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, the company said in a regulatory filing.

LGES will release detailed earnings on October 30.

ENERGY STORAGE, GEORGIA RAID

LGES has tried to boost production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset sluggish EV demand and improve profits in the second half of this year.

The company has signed a $4.3 billion deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, as the U.S. automaker looks to reduce reliance on Chinese imports due to tariffs.

In September, LGES suffered a setback with its joint battery factory with Hyundai Motor in the United States. Construction has been suspended in the wake of an immigration raid on the Georgia facility in early September that led to the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers.

Hyundai Motor CEO Jose Munoz said last month the factory was facing a minimum startup delay of two to three months after the raid.

LGES said early this month that it would gradually resume U.S. business trips for its employees and subcontractors, a day after the Trump administration agreed to allow South Koreans to work on equipment at U.S. sites under existing temporary visas.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Battery maker (LGES) said on Monday its third-quarter operating profit likely rose 34% as U.S. consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles to take advantage of government incentives that expired on September 30.

The South Korean company, which supplies EV batteries to and , estimated its operating profit was 601 billion won ($420 million) during the July to September period, up from 448 billion won in profit a year earlier.

Its profit may have been boosted by the surge in U.S. EV sales ahead of the end of a $7,500 federal tax credit in September, analysts said.

LGES warned in July of a further slowdown in EV demand by early next year due to the elimination of the tax credits as well as U.S. import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump’s administration.

LGES shares were up 1.5% in a wider market that was down 1.4%.

LGES will release detailed earnings on October 30.

ENERGY STORAGE, GEORGIA RAID

LGES has tried to boost production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset sluggish EV demand and improve profits in the second half of this year.

The company has signed a $4.3 billion deal to supply Tesla with energy storage system batteries, as the U.S. automaker looks to reduce reliance on Chinese imports due to tariffs.

In September, LGES suffered a setback with its joint battery factory with in the United States. Construction has been suspended in the wake of an immigration raid on the Georgia facility in early September that led to the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers.

Hyundai Motor CEO Jose Munoz said last month the factory was facing a minimum startup delay of two to three months after the raid.

LGES said early this month that it would gradually resume U.S. business trips for its employees and subcontractors, a day after the Trump administration agreed to allow South Koreans to work on equipment at U.S. sites under existing temporary visas.

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://images.wral.com/asset/business/2025/10/12/22196039/68eb9496641a5-media_b5c41dfb052c4ea5955ceb4e3ecb9e8a-DMID1-68mkdtxsj-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 20:59:27.170776

US authorities have warned they will take retaliatory measures against any country supporting an international carbon tax on maritime transport. This announcement comes just days ahead of a crucial vote within the International Maritime Organization (IMO), where members are set to decide on a proposal to implement a global carbon levy on ship emissions.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, along with the Secretaries of Energy and Transportation, described the proposed measure as “neo-colonial” in a statement. Washington asserts that the implementation of such a fiscal mechanism on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions — referred to by the acronym NZF — would harm US economic interests and negatively impact supply chains and consumers.

Anticipated economic repercussions

US officials estimate the tax could raise shipping costs by 10% or more. Authorities claim that such a levy on carbon emissions would directly affect shipping companies, energy suppliers and importers, leading to price increases for citizens and businesses.

The NZF tax proposal would be the first global fiscal mechanism adopted by a United Nations agency, according to the statement. The London-based IMO oversees international shipping regulations and aims to reduce the sector’s total emissions in line with its environmental goals.

A stance aligned with current US policy

Since returning to power, President Donald Trump has reoriented US energy policy in favour of fossil fuels, rolling back multiple international climate commitments. The White House withdrew from the Paris Agreement and enacted a series of deregulation measures aimed at supporting the oil, gas and coal industries.

This shift has resulted in growing hostility toward multilateral initiatives perceived as burdensome to the US economy. At the United Nations, President Trump previously described climate change as “the greatest scam” in history, rejecting scientific consensus and advocating for complete economic sovereignty.

Targeted economic sanctions under consideration

Among the measures under consideration are visa restrictions and increased port fees for vessels owned by or registered in countries supporting the carbon tax. These steps are intended to discourage any endorsement of a system the US considers imposed without its consent.

This is not observed in the lithium market.” “Lithium isn’t just about cars.","Lithium is enduring its most misunderstood moment in years. Prices have collapsed since the 2022 peak, investor sentiment is bruised, and there are persistent murmurs of an EV slowdown. Yet those closest to the ground – the explorers, developers, and future producers – are saying something very different.

According to global leaders across the sector, the world is sleepwalking into the largest structural supply deficit in the history of battery metals. And this time, the demand drivers go far beyond electric vehicles.

Mining.com.au is this week digging deep into the state of the lithium market and in a feature series that uncovers how mining leaders see the outlook to 2030 and beyond, and what the catalysts will be driving the market.

Speaking exclusively to a range of global lithium leaders, a powerful consensus is emerging – the lithium market is not dying, it’s maturing. And the next decade is poised to dwarf everything that has come before.

The global lithium market is in a period of flux. After years of solid growth, prices have plummeted from the 2022 peak amid reports of declining demand for EVs and an oversupply.

However, ongoing demand growth and temporary production curtailments in China has seen lithium prices improve so far in the September quarter. Spodumene concentrate prices increased from just above US$600 a tonne in June, reached US$1,000 tonne in late August, before easing to around US$820 a tonne in the second half of September.

Although this price recovery may be under threat from the reported reopening of a higher cost lepidolite operation in China on 10 September 2025.

Lithium hydroxide prices have enjoyed a recovery of almost 20% over the same period, rising from US$7,550 a tonne to around US$9,000 ($13,835) in September. The rise follows a recovery in spodumene prices – the primary feedstock for these operations refineries – with refiners starting to draw down on their accumulated inventories.

By 2027, spodumene is expected to rise to an annual average price of about US$925 a tonne, while lithium hydroxide should average about US$13,250.

Australia is the largest producer of lithium ore (accounting for 46% of the global total in 2024) but felt this decline more sharply than most. In turn several mining operations paused amid deteriorating market conditions.

However, analysts and mining executives alike believe a rebound may be on the horizon, fuelled by renewed growth in EV adoption and clean energy storage. Although lithium prices remain difficult to predict, miners are once more betting big on the metal.

‘Dark horse’ of demand

Venari Minerals (ASX:ASE) CEO Matt Healy is blunt – global lithium demand will triple by 2030, yet the current market is acting like the party’s over.

“The price collapse created the illusion that supply is abundant,” he tells Mining.com.au, “but even a minor disruption like recent mine shutdowns in China sent prices bouncing back. That tells you the market is far tighter than people think.”

Healy notes a critical fact that many overlook is that the world needs 50 to 70 new lithium mines by 2030 just to meet demand.

“This represents around double the number of significant mines in operation today,” he says. “That is a near-impossible task at current investment levels.”

EVs will constitute the main source of lithium consumption going forward, notes Healy, with increasing growth in consumption rates arising from stationary storage, electric trucks, and buses.

Further driving this growth, says Healy, is the rapid penetration of renewable energy into Western energy markets, which has resulted in excess electricity necessitating storage technology.

For this reason global Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) deployments in H1 2025 are up 58% over the first six months of 2024, making BESS the “dark horse” of lithium demand, he adds.

According to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) September 2025 Resources and Energy Quarterly, BESS growth is expected to be at almost 13% a year to 2027 driven primarily by its increasingly important role in electricity grids.

BESS are now also supplying electricity during high demand periods in addition to their existing role in providing grid auxiliary services.

Healy’s own focus is advancing Venari’s resource pipeline, with metallurgical work, a maiden resource and a scoping study in the next 18-24 months.

Fear and loathing

Similarly, Q2 Metals (TSX-V:QTWO) Corporate Development Chris Ackerman calls today’s sentiment what it is – irrational.

“Lithium is probably the most loathed commodity right now,” he tells this news service.

“But EV adoption is still growing. BESS is accelerating even faster. Nations are racing to secure supply. The fundamentals are stronger than ever.”

Ackerman says there are other disruptors that are emerging and vying for centre stage, as well. With the advancement of AI and the need for data centres, as well as the need for energy storage capacity for solar and wind (renewables) energy via BESS, will be key drivers moving forward. BESS is needed to store renewable energy/energy grid storage.

He thinks the assertion that there has been declining demand for EVs is something industry watchers might challenge. The International Energy Agency, for instance, cites robust sales.

According to the IEA, global electric car sales in 2025 are expected to exceed 20 million to represent more than 25% of cars sold worldwide. Sales were up 35% year-on-year in the first three months of 2025, with record first-quarter sales in all major markets.

In China, the IEA reports continuation of incentives for replacing older vehicles and falling electric car prices mean electric cars are projected to reach around 60% of total car sales in the country in 2025.

Emissions standards in the European Union and the UK will require higher shares of zero-emission car sales in 2025.

The IEA says building on more than 20% year-on-year sales growth observed in the first quarter, “these policy pushes are expected to drive up electric car sales in Europe in 2025 to reach a sales share of 25%, despite flexibility given to automakers for meeting the 2025 EU emissions reduction target”.

“While the 2025 outlook for electric car sales in the United States is uncertain based on today’s policy direction, sales are currently expected to maintain the 10% growth observed in the first quarter; as consumers take advantage of existing tax credits in view of their potential repeal, electric car sales are projected to reach 11% of total car sales over the full year,” the IEA reports.

In emerging economies other than China, sales are projected to continue growing strongly, increasing by 50% to reach 1 million in 2025.

“Globally, EV adoption continues to grow unfettered, obviously led by China which continues to dominate and expand. General consensus – always a dangerous word – tends to lean strongly toward the future of the broader lithium market being a demand-driven story,” Ackerman tells Mining.com.au.

“EVs are just one part of that, with BESS, robotics, drones and other areas coming to the fore.

“The spectacular rise and fall of lithium price over the past several years showed just how volatile a somewhat nascent market can be as the fundamentals of supply and demand get sorted out. The world quickly learned that there is plenty of lithium out there, but how much of that which came into play was only economic at higher prices.

“That mania was short-lived but, just as the peak was unsustainable, the trough has been overdone, as well. Whether one sees some manipulation in the market or the oversupply or if it’s just a volatile course plotted due to battery storage and electrification still being in its infancy, the forward demand picture looks strong.”

Ackerman suggests the market will mature to where there is balance in those forces and a price point ultimately settled where project economics will dictate which of the more marginal projects gather dust and the exceptional projects will thrive.

He says there has been a more pronounced or, at least, public, push by nations around the world – whether in collaboration or purely domestic – to secure access to critical minerals supply as well as a recognition of the oversized role China has developed, to the point of supply chain dominance in many cases.

The most recent clear example of that, says Ackermanm, is the US Department of Energy acquiring a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and another 5% in their Thacker Pass project in Nevada.

“It will be interesting to see if / how this trend plays out. There’s a lot happening globally in all resource sectors. There is a renewed interest in domestic supply chains, specifically in North America,” he continues.

“Additionally, North America is also looking to accelerate the timelines it takes to get a mine into operation without compromising the necessary environmental work that needs to happen.”

Ackerman believes the market is young, volatile, and misunderstood, but heading for maturity.

“We’re entering the phase where price finds equilibrium, and that price will be much higher than today because supply simply cannot keep pace,” Ackerman adds.

Q2 Metals plans to deliver a maiden resource in 2026, backed by strong drilling results and investor interest.

Rebalancing and a reawakening

Killian Charles, CEO of Brunswick Exploration (TSX-V:BRW), just cuts through all the noise.

“People keep saying ‘EV demand is down’. It isn’t. EVs are still growing 20-30% annually,” he tells Mining.com.au, concurring with Healy and Ackerman.

“What’s changed is that lithium supply came online faster than expected. But that wave has peaked. Future supply growth is slowing dramatically.”

For Charles, the real story is renewables and energy access.

“Lithium isn’t just about cars. It’s about the grid. Without lithium, there is no large-scale renewable adoption. That demand will dwarf EVs.”

He forecasts the market will rebalance in the near term, with incentivising prices returning by 2028. By 2030, Charles expects a larger, more stable, less volatile market and far higher total demand.

“Broadly speaking, I expect a market rebalancing to occur throughout 2026 and into 2027 followed by incentivised pricing in 2028 and beyond. This is largely driven by significant demand growth,” Charles tells this news service.

“While much has been written about declining EV demand, this is largely a non-issue. Yes, EV sales are down but so are car sales in general. EVs as a proportion of total car sales are still increasing (reaching 25% on a global basis) even if most of these sales are predominantly Chinese driven.

“Typically, bear markets for commodities are driven by very weak demand growth and, at times, reducing demand. This is not observed in the lithium market.”

“Lithium isn’t just about cars. It’s about the grid. Without lithium, there is no large-scale renewable adoption. That demand will dwarf EVs”

Demand is still forecasted to grow by 12% per annum over the next five years, which Brunswick’s CEO notes is a “staggering” amount and remains the fastest growing commodity market. By 2030, he expects the market to start to mature.

“We have seen major swings in lithium prices over the last 10-15 years and this has underscored the immaturity of the market where the addition of a single mine or single new battery plant can cause huge imbalances,” Charles tells this news service.

“By then, one would expect the overall size of the market to better absorb new assets on the supply or the demand side. Not to say there won’t be swings in the price but they will be considerably dampened.”

Brunswick’ s CEO is also one of few speaking openly about geography.

“The next major supply won’t just come from Australia and China. Look at Québec, Brazil, Congo, Zimbabwe. That’s where growth is headed,” Charles continues.

Brunswick is advancing discoveries in Greenland and Quebec and expects a maiden resource at its Mirage project.

Energy storage the ‘real story’

Meanwhile, Patagonia Lithium (ASX:PL3) Executive Chairman Phil Thomas zooms out to the global stage.

“The lithium story is no longer just EVs,” he explains. “The real game is battery energy storage, grid stability, AI data centres, electrification of developing economies, and even electric aviation.”

Thomas tells this news service that demand could reach 2.5-3 million tonnes LCE by 2030, driven by renewable deployment and government mandates. He warns the current oversupply stage is temporary.

“By the early 2030s, we’re back in deficit. Recycling and new technologies help, but they won’t prevent shortages.”

Thomas sees lithium as strategic infrastructure, not a commodity.

“Nations will treat lithium the way they treat oil. National security, local content, supply chain control, it’s already happening,” he adds.

As such, Thomas says the lithium sector is at a pivotal juncture. While demand is set to increase significantly, supply challenges, investment needs, and geopolitical factors present complexities. Stakeholders across the value chain must navigate these dynamics to ensure a balanced and sustainable lithium market by 2030.

“However it’s unlikely to come from EVs as apart from China and Scandinavia the take up of EV cars is less than 8%. It’s most likely going to come from Battery energy storage systems,” he agrees.

According to the International Energy Agency, global lithium demand is expected to reach 531,000 tonnes by 2030, up from 165,000 tonnes in 2023. This surge is primarily driven by the electrification of transportation and the expansion of energy storage systems.

Similarly, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts lithium demand to reach 2.4 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent by 2030, nearly 1.8 million tonnes more than current 2025 levels.

Patagonia is positioning brine resources to serve this shift, leveraging lower costs and policy support.

Why the next boom will be different

The next lithium boom is shaping up to be different. The EV market is still growing, battery storage is surging, AI/data centres are consuming huge power, and developing markets are now electrifying.

Lithium is no longer just a battery metal, it is the foundation of the energy, technology and geopolitical systems of the future. And the people actually building the mines know it.

Investors seem to have abandoned lithium at the exact moment demand is about to go parabolic. Supply is stalling. Capital is scarce. Timelines are long. And yet the world is about to need more lithium than at any point in human history.

Healy, Ackerman, Charles, and Thomas may differ in style but they are perfectly aligned on one thing – lithium’s current downturn marks the end of the beginning – not the beginning of the end.

Global lithium extraction is forecast to grow by more than 13% annually over the outlook period, to reach over 1.8 million tonnes of LCE by 2027.

Australia is expected to remain the leading lithium supplier with some 31% global share in 2027 down from 36% in 2024. In 2027, China’s share of global supply is expected to reach 29%.

Recent advances in salt roasting technology in China have led to a sharp rise in domestic lepidolite-based output, contributing to the current global oversupply.

Argentina is also expected to significantly expand lithium extraction capacity. China’s share of global extraction is forecast to increase from 25% in 2024 to almost 29% in 2027 through a combination of new brine and hard rock projects.

According to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources September 2025 Resources and Energy Quarterly, global primary lithium carbonate production is forecast to rise by more than 10% a year from 744 kt LCE in 2024 to 1,161 kt LCE by 2027.

China is expected to underpin this rise, increasing from around 59% in 2024 to over 66% in 2027. Presently, there’s no significant investment in facilities to process hard-rock feedstock into lithium carbonate outside of China. World primary lithium hydroxide production is projected to rise by more than 9% a year to 781 kt LCE by 2027.

While China’s production of lithium hydroxide is expected to increase from 397 kt LCE in 2024 to 537 kt LCE in 2027, its global share is set to fall from 86% to 69% over the period. This fall follows the ramp up of new lithium hydroxide production capacity amongst several emerging producers.

Meanwhile, Australia is projected to increase its share in global lithium hydroxide production to 9%, Indonesia will rise to 5%, US to 4%, and South Korea to 3% of world output.

Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity from renewable energy sources, with minimal emissions.
Jon Butterworth, the chief executive of National Gas, said: “It’s another crucial milestone on Britain’s hydrogen journey, showing how blending can fuel our power stations and unlock new investment opportunities for producers.
“By using our existing National Gas infrastructure, pipes that have reliably served Britain for decades, we can power the next era of clean British energy and industry.
Working with industry and government, we’re proud to be leading this effort to make hydrogen a cornerstone of our energy system.”","Energy companies have injected green hydrogen into Britain’s gas grid and used the low-carbon gas to generate electricity, in a landmark development for the UK’s climate ambitions.

For the first time in the UK, a 2% blend of green hydrogen was injected into the gas grid and blended with traditional gas to fuel the Brigg power station in North Lincolnshire which generated electricity for the power system.

Blending hydrogen into the gas system has already taken place in controlled environments using decommissioned sections of the transmission system, but the first “real-life” test in the UK was carried out by British Gas’s parent company, Centrica, and National Gas, which owns Britain’s gas transmission system.

The companies believe the test’s success shows the potential for hydrogen, which does not produce any carbon dioxide when burned, to cut harmful emissions from areas of the economy where other low-carbon options might not be available.

Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity from renewable energy sources, with minimal emissions. It is seen as key to decarbonising energy-intensive industries – although there is fierce debate over its use, with claims that heat pumps powered by electricity are much more efficient.

Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, said: “The success of this trial is a significant moment for our country’s energy future. It highlights the vital role that innovation across our industrial heartlands can play in creating highly skilled unionised jobs in working-class communities, an essential part of any credible plan to meet our net zero obligations.”

Centrica and National Gas are urging the government to back the use of hydrogen blends of up to 5% in the UK’s gas system.

Jon Butterworth, the chief executive of National Gas, said: “It’s another crucial milestone on Britain’s hydrogen journey, showing how blending can fuel our power stations and unlock new investment opportunities for producers.

ANOTHER VOTE ON ALTERNATIVE CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS PROPOSAL: The Sen­ate on Octo­ber 9th reject­ed a clo­ture motion to end debate on the motion to con­sid­er the Con­tin­u­ing Appro­pri­a­tions and Exten­sions and Oth­er Mat­ters Act (S. 2882), spon­sored by our own Sen­a­tor Pat­ty Mur­ray, D‑Washington. The bill would repeal health care-relat­ed pro­vi­sions in H.R. 1 (Trump’s ugly vul­ture bud­get) and pro­vide fund­ing for the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment through Octo­ber 31st.

Mur­ray called on Repub­li­cans to work with Democ­rats “on a bipar­ti­san deal to reopen the gov­ern­ment and address this health­care cri­sis” of reduced tax cred­its for health insur­ance. An oppo­nent, Sen­ate Major­i­ty Leader John Thune, R‑South Dako­ta, said the bill “makes nonci­t­i­zens eli­gi­ble for fed­er­al health­care pro­grams, strips away com­mon­sense work require­ments for able-bod­ied adults to be eli­gi­ble for Med­ic­aid, and repeals the trans­for­ma­tive $50 bil­lion rur­al health fund that Repub­li­cans enact­ed in July to sup­port and bol­ster rur­al hospitals.”

2026 MILITARY BUDGET: The Sen­ate on Octo­ber 9th passed the Nation­al Defense Autho­riza­tion Act (S. 2296), spon­sored by Sen­a­tor Roger F. Wick­er, R‑Mississippi.

Wick­er said sup­port for the mil­i­tary was vital at “the most dan­ger­ous time we have had since World War II,” and the bill also sig­nif­i­cant­ly reformed mil­i­tary acqui­si­tion pro­ce­dures. A bill oppo­nent, Sen­a­tor Dick Durbin, D‑Illinois, crit­i­cized its lack of ade­quate sup­port for the Baltic Secu­ri­ty Ini­tia­tive to pro­tect Esto­nia, Latvia, and Lithua­nia from Russ­ian aggres­sion.

REJECTING AMENDMENT ON FEDERAL RESERVE INSPECTOR GENERAL: The Sen­ate on Octo­ber 9th reject­ed an amend­ment spon­sored by Sen­a­tor Rick Scott, R‑Florida, to the Nation­al Defense Autho­riza­tion Act (S. 2296, above) that would have required Sen­ate con­fir­ma­tion of the inspec­tors gen­er­al nom­i­nat­ed for the Fed­er­al Reserve Sys­tem and the Bureau of Con­sumer Finan­cial Protection.

Scott said replac­ing the cur­rent approach of hav­ing the Fed­er­al Reserve chair­man appoint the inspec­tor gen­er­al would “bring true account­abil­i­ty to the Fed and ensure the cen­tral bank is work­ing in Amer­i­ca’s best inter­est.” An amend­ment oppo­nent, Sen­a­tor Gary C. Peters, D‑Michigan, said it would wrong­ly give the pres­i­dent “increased pow­ers to politi­cize our cen­tral bank and its crit­i­cal mon­e­tary pol­i­cy deci­sions.” The vote was 53 yeas to 43 nays, with a three-fifths thresh­old required.

BARRING FUNDING FOR QATARI JET: The Sen­ate on Octo­ber 9th reject­ed an amend­ment spon­sored by Sen­ate Minor­i­ty Leader Chuck Schumer, D‑New York, to the Nation­al Defense Autho­riza­tion Act (S. 2296, above) that would have barred fund­ing for the pur­chase or oper­a­tion of an air­plane for­mer­ly con­trolled by a for­eign coun­try to use the air­plane for pres­i­den­tial air trav­el. In ref­er­ence to the planned use of an air­plane from Qatar by the pres­i­dent, Schumer said: “It is out­ra­geous that Pres­i­dent Trump wants to fly around the world like a king while Amer­i­cans are get­ting ham­mered by tar­iffs and pay­ing more for health­care, gro­ceries, rent, and electricity.”

An oppo­nent, Sen­a­tor Deb Fis­ch­er, R‑Nebraska, said the amend­ment, by block­ing the mil­i­tary’s use of a so-called Dooms­day Plane bought from Kore­an Air in the event of a nuclear war, “would affect one of our mil­i­tary’s most impor­tant pro­grams: the Sur­viv­able Air­borne Oper­a­tions Cen­ter.” The vote was 46 yeas to 50 nays.

Facts like this tend to undermine the reputation of the energy transition as the only way forward, with a net zero of acceptable alternatives.
Germany has been at the forefront of the energy transition, with massive wind and solar capacity, and yet it needs a lot of gas to survive the winter.
China has led the world in both oil and gas demand, and wind and solar installations for years now.
The warning came soon after the U.S. Energy Secretary suggested the IEA remember what it was set up to do—focus on energy security—and stop playing cheerleader for the energy transition.","Earlier this month, a top Shell executive warned that the Trump administration’s animosity towards offshore wind risks complicating investment decisions for oil and gas as well. Uncertainty was the word Collette Hirstius used. Uncertainty has become the dominant sentiment in energy circles—and it’s not just because of Trump.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Shell’s Hirstius said that “I think uncertainty in the regulatory environment is very damaging. However far the pendulum swings one way, it’s likely that it’s going to swing just as far the other way.” This is an apt observation, only it could be argued that Trump’s policy towards wind, and to a lesser extent solar, is also an example of the pendulum swinging back, after billions of dollars were spent on developing technologies that, contrary to predictions, did not bring electricity prices down. It is this failure of the transition promises to materialize that is changing sentiment in global energy.

Spain is a case in point. This spring, both Spain and Portugal suffered a devastating blackout that authorities and grid operators at the time refused to link to the amount of solar generation at the time. Now, Spain’s grid operator is warning that it could happen again because there are wild swings in voltage. The warning comes days after the European Union’s ENTSO-E—the bloc’s grid operators’ network—published its report on the April blackout, pointing to excessive voltage as the cause.

Excessive voltage is not something caused by gas, nuclear, or coal power plants. Swings in voltage are one of the less publicized properties of wind and solar installations, and the thing that forces curtailment during demand troughs, precisely to avoid blackouts. So, grid operators are essentially saying there is a problem with uncontrolled wind and solar, and it could be a serious problem. Facts like this tend to undermine the reputation of the energy transition as the only way forward, with a net zero of acceptable alternatives. So do facts like Germany’s vulnerability to energy price shocks as a result of insufficient gas reserves for the winter season.

Gas major Uniper warned this week that the country could face a bill of 40 billion euros, which is about $46.6 billion, if it failed to keep its gas reserve 90% full—something rather unlikely for peak demand season. Germany has been at the forefront of the energy transition, with massive wind and solar capacity, and yet it needs a lot of gas to survive the winter. Something clearly does not add up, widening the divide between what politicians want to have as an energy system and what is possible to have as an energy system—without blackouts.

This is clearly affecting investment decisions both in the wind and solar sectors, and in oil and gas. Caution is the new black in both parts of the energy world because this pendulum keeps swinging. The International Energy Agency recently issued a Renewables 2025 report, in which it predicted a 50% slump in wind, solar, EV and similar investments in the United States because of the Trump administration’s policies. But it also noted it had revised its growth numbers because of policy changes in China.

China has led the world in both oil and gas demand, and wind and solar installations for years now. China has been used both as an example of how to do an energy transition and as a demonstration that whatever the EU or, say, the UK does about its emissions, China’s emissions continue to grow, and quite significantly, offsetting any decline elsewhere and then some. Yet now China is building additional oil storage capacity while reining in its solar industries to put an end to what has become popular as a race to the bottom.

China, then, this transition leader, is effectively admitting that the subsidy-driven industry growth model does not work over the longer term. All it does is spur a race to the bottom, meaning intense competition, a downward spiral for prices and the resulting proliferation of negative bottom lines and ultimately company failures. Yet governments in European countries, Canada, and Australia are trying to replicate the Chinese model of subsidized transition.

While expecting this model to prompt the twofold increase in wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal capacity by 2030, the International Energy Agency warned the world needs to invest more in oil and gas because field depletion was happening faster than previously assumed. The warning came soon after the U.S. Energy Secretary suggested the IEA remember what it was set up to do—focus on energy security—and stop playing cheerleader for the energy transition.

Big Oil, meanwhile, is doubling down on its recent shift from low-carbon investments to core business, despite all the political uncertainty and complicatedness. Per its own admissions, the industry is doing what makes money—even without all the subsidies that wind and solar have enjoyed in the EU for years and enjoyed in the U.S. for quite a while as well.

Some say the world is bifurcating into those who know the energy transition could never work, so they are securing their future supply of hydrocarbons, and those who choose to ignore evidence of the above and continue to pursue decarbonization policies that only lead to more expensive and less reliable energy. They may well be right.

As CBC reported, this is a huge milestone on the path to the province hitting its 2030 renewable energy target.

In September, Halifax-based renewables firm Natural Forces completed the final installations for the Benjamins Mill Wind Project. Now nearing completion, the onshore wind farm will complete final tests before becoming operational and producing 33.6 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy. Each year, this wind farm alone can reduce harmful emissions by about 84,500 tonnes (over 93,000 tons).

""It's huge … a really big milestone for the project,"" said project construction manager Andrea Bradshaw, per CBC. ""There's a lot of work left to do after this in terms of mechanical and electrical completion, but, yeah, this is a big one.""

Nova Scotia is aiming to generate more than 300 MW of wind energy by the end of 2026. Currently, there are three other onshore wind projects in development in addition to the Benjamins Mill Wind Project. By 2030, Nova Scotia hopes to phase out coal and rely on renewable sources of energy, including wind and solar, to generate 80% of its power.

The burning of dirty fuels, such as coal, contributes to planet-warming pollution, adverse health effects, and more extreme weather disasters. Wind farms can reduce harmful emissions and water pollution while also having a minimal impact on wildlife and lowering electricity bills.

Developers hoped to have the Benjamins Mill Wind Project operational by last year, but studies on its impact have halted that timeline.

According to Robert Apold, a principal with Natural Forces, the project was selected to be a ""guinea pig"" for new approaches to renewable energy in Nova Scotia.

""Once the guinea pigs have gone through … I think we hit a rhythm, and once we hit the rhythm, it should be a lot easier from that point on,"" he told CBC.

Across the globe, both onshore and offshore wind farms are being built as an alternative to fossil fuels that can clean the air and produce renewable energy. In Egypt, a wind farm has recently come online, capable of powering half a million homes. In Stockholm, Sweden, a proposed offshore wind project could generate half of the city's power. Even in the U.S., wind farms are being built to power communities. Recently, a New York wind farm was completed that can power 70,000 homes and businesses.

For Nova Scotia, the Benjamins Mill Wind Project marks a massive step toward renewable energy, but it's just the beginning.

""We're always looking at what we need to reach our 80% renewables, and we believe we're well on our way,"" said Nova Scotia Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau in a press conference.

Despite some scrapped plans, energy companies are moving forward with new wind farm projects.

""ABO Energy Canada remains committed to our wind projects, with development activity continuing to move forward,"" said Sean Fleming, senior project manager of renewables at ABO, who recently scrapped a Nova Scotia project, per CBC.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-1307666876.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:01:14.583072

Decisions about how the money will be spent will return to Wales, honouring the UK Government’s manifesto commitment to restore decision-making on money that previously came from the EU.

The Welsh and UK Governments have agreed a framework which will set priorities and processes for allocating the funds, with a delivery plan developed and led by the Welsh Government.

Local authorities and other partners will have a key role in deciding how the funding is spent. Later this month, the Welsh Government will consult on the best way to use this funding through a consultation.

The Welsh Government is keen to understand how it can best:

support people into work and help people gain new skills and qualifications to progress into higher paid jobs, so that a larger proportion of the population is employed

help create and grow Welsh businesses in key sectors and boost investment in research and innovation, in areas such as health and bio-tech, financial technology, low carbon energy and AI

address the issues that are holding back growth, such as the need for key sites and premises, renewable and low-carbon energy generation, energy efficiency, and low-carbon transport.

First Minister Eluned Morgan said:

“Our new Local Growth Fund for Wales is a significant opportunity to support businesses and social enterprises to grow, export and innovate - particularly in high-growth sectors such as AI, cybersecurity and digital transformation. By tackling barriers like access to finance and encouraging investment in research and development, we can help build a more competitive and resilient Welsh economy.

“Supporting people into work and helping them progress is vital to reducing economic inactivity. By aligning skills development with the needs of our regional economies, we can ensure people across Wales are well placed for the jobs of the future.

“We’re keen to see a strong focus on green infrastructure, energy efficiency and local regeneration. We will encourage investment in renewable energy, low-carbon transport, and heritage. Tourism will be supported in a way that helps our communities thrive.

“I’m very pleased that, following agreement with the UK Government, decisions on the priorities in this fund will be made here by the Welsh Government.”

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

“This more than half a billion pound investment from the UK Government is key to driving economic growth in Wales, helping to grow businesses and get more people into good well-paid jobs.

“Decisions about how this money is spent are best made by people in Wales and we are working with the Welsh Government to achieve our shared priority of delivering growth, prosperity and opportunity across the country.”

Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, Rebecca Evans, said:

“This new fund will focus on supporting regional growth and productivity, as well as tackling economic inequalities.

“We will now work at pace with our partners to prioritise investment in each region.”

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was ""taking on big oil.""

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area. But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it. Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.” Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties. California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network. “We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said. But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies. “The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement. Life as an oil worker For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree. Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery. But there are downsides. Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work. Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years. “There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”

The shift appears to be largely due to credits’ unreliability in practice.

This seems like basic risk management. A long-term investment model can’t count on green energy tax incentives that can be repealed or defunded as quickly and easily as they’re passed. The implications could be bigger than one automaker or one credit. If multinational companies’ trust in tax incentives collapses, the entire premise of incentive-based industrial policy starts to unravel.

And corporations now have good reason to doubt those incentives’ enduring nature. Companies that bet big on the US clean energy transition during the previous administration lost big in July, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through a tax-and-spending package that clawed back a huge swath of green energy incentives created under the Inflation Reduction Act just three years earlier.

Electric vehicle credits are gone. Subsidies for clean hydrogen, wind, solar, and even nuclear energy are slashed. What was framed in 2022 as a decade-long runway for green investment became a cautionary tale on how quickly industrial policy can be uprooted by shifting political winds.

The short-term consequences of gutting green tax credits are clear: fewer projects, declining deployment of green technology, and lost jobs. The long-term effects may be less obvious and more difficult to fix. Once companies stop believing US tax policy is durable, they’ll stop building around it—reducing tax credits’ effectiveness in spurring investment.

If Volvo’s views are a bellwether, lawmakers soon will realize that they can only push and pull the tax incentive lever so many times before it breaks off in their hands.

The restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain.
As with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods.
In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity — enough to supply power for around 3 million homes — went online last year.
Trump and President Xi Jinping were expected to meet in South Korea later this month to broker a new trade deal.","China’s newly announced raft of restrictions on the export of batteries could have major impacts on US companies, analysts say.

Beijing has previously used rare earths as a tool in the trade war with Washington. But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.

The restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.

As with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.

“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.

In the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.

Battery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.

While China’s AI boom is constrained by access to advanced chips from the US, ​​”the energy demand piece is the constraint in the US for AI data center infrastructure,” said Emily Kilcrease, director of the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

Large-scale batteries help store excess renewable energy and release it when electricity is needed. That can help avert blackouts and bolster grid stability. Practically non-existent a decade ago, US utility-scale battery installation reached a total of 26 gigawatts in 2024. In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity — enough to supply power for around 3 million homes — went online last year.

As much as 136 gigawatts of new capacity is expected to be added across the country over the next decade, according to BNEF. Much of that supply will need to come from China and can’t be easily replaced by other countries, Hales said.

US battery manufacturing capacity has grown in recent years, but it can’t meet domestic demand for energy storage. Those factories will also be impacted by China’s new restrictions. The Asian nation controls about 96% of the world’s anode production capacity, according to BNEF, and 85% of its cathode capacity.

The inclusion of these key components in Beijing’s measures represents a “huge escalation,” because companies outside China are so reliant on them, said Cory Combs, head of critical minerals and supply chain research at the consultancy Trivium China.

“A lot of the battery factories that have been going up in the Southeast, they’re all going to be impacted by this — this is their raw material stream,” said Celina Mikolajczak, a battery executive who oversaw battery manufacturing for Tesla Inc. and Panasonic Corp.’s Nevada gigafactory.

Battery company Fluence Energy Inc.’s stock dropped more than 12% on Friday, the most since Aug 12, while Tesla shares fell 5%. Both companies rely in part on Chinese battery components.

The policy actions by China “add another layer of complexity to an already tight global supply chain and underscore the importance of accelerating domestic innovation,” said Denis Phares, the chief executive officer of Dragonfly Energy Corp., a battery manufacturer with an assembly plant in Nevada. The company is “actively working to reduce reliance on Chinese-sourced components as part of our long-term plan,” he said.

Export controls could also put China’s multibillion-dollar battery industry in the crossfire. In the face of overcapacity domestically, Chinese companies have become increasingly reliant on overseas markets, making it “unclear how China intends to enforce its new regime,” said Bryan Bille, a researcher on policy and geopolitics at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

There’s also another complicating factor: Analysts view China’s measures not only as a crucial source of leverage in trade negotiations, but also as a means to maintain its competitive edge.

“I think they've been very explicit about not wanting to give away core technologies,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, senior fellow focused on the Chinese clean energy industry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think they really are angling to become the leading power in this industry for decades to come.”

How much China ultimately decides to wield its battery leverage will likely depend in part on the outcome of trade talks. China allowed for the reinstatement of rare earth shipments to the US after reaching a deal with President Donald Trump’s administration in June.

Trump and President Xi Jinping were expected to meet in South Korea later this month to broker a new trade deal. But in response to China’s latest barrage of controls, Trump said there was “no reason” to attend the meeting and threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on China in a series of social media posts on Friday.

Rising unemployment and higher prices threaten economic stability.","Once upon a time, a king demanded the tide stop coming in. But this was not a foolish act, for the king was actually trying to show his foolish advisors the limits to power. Unfortunately, our self-proclaimed king not only has foolish advisors, but is foolish himself, believing whatever he says must be reality.

He foolishly believes the climate crisis is a hoax, so he props up aging fossil fueled plants and destroys efforts to address, or even monitor, climate changes already happening. Coal, a 19th century energy source, is expected to power 21st century AI data centers. Operating a coal fired plant costs more than building new wind/solar with storage. The Big Beautiful Bill cancels funding for wind and solar, mostly in Democratic-led states, unsettling the financial underpinnings of the entire U.S. energy industry. Without even considering the adverse climate impact, consumers will annually pay an extra $3 billion power bills. Electricity rates increased by nearly 7 percent in the last year, with more rate increases on the horizon.

After the mindless DOGE staffing purge, the Energy Department doesn’t have enough lawyers left to carry out the project cancellations ordered by the White House, and will instead have to spend millions on outside counsel.

There have been no major domestic nuclear accidents since Three Mile Island, partially due to Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight. Now, hundreds of people have been fired from the agency and only three of the five NRC commissioner positions are filled, making the recent push for more nuclear power increasingly risky.

Our king foolishly believes raising tariffs and excluding workers will make the country richer. As a result, the economy is suffering the highest tariffs in a century and consumers pay higher prices. John Deere, producer of machinery for many American farms, says sales are down, with higher tariffs increasing costs by $600 million. Tariffs on steel and aluminum led to losses of thousands of manufacturing job. Instead of reducing drug prices, tariffs have increased prices on almost 700 prescription drugs so far this year.

Farmers face a slump in crop prices and worsening credit conditions. Corn prices are down 50 percent, and soybean prices are down 40 percent, as overseas markets for crops are lost due to tariffs. With the massive assault on undocumented workers, farmers are caught in the middle of a 155,000-worker shortfall across the national agricultural sector, which means lower supply and higher prices.

Tariffs have weakened consumer spending, as jobs are evaporating, with sharp drops in home construction. One indication is a 9 percent decline in containerboard-production capacity in eight months, twice the capacity that was lost during the recession in 2009.

Nearly 30 countries have suspended postal services of packages to U.S. over import tariffs, including Australia, Japan, India, and Europe. After September 21, no H-1B worker will be allowed to enter the US unless the sponsoring employer pays a $100,000 fee. These are workers with specialized knowledge that no one local can fill.

Employment fell by 13,000 jobs in June, marking the first net loss since December 2020, with another 32,000 jobs lost in September. Last month, jobless claims surged in one week, when 263,000 new people filing for unemployment insurance, 10 percent higher than the previous week. Unemployment rate is 4.3 percent, the highest level since the pandemic. Rising unemployment and higher prices threaten economic stability. But instead of dealing with what they created, the administration fired the record keepers.

Billionaires benefit from tax cuts, while MAGA voters are bearing the brunt. A majority of Republicans now think he’s on the wrong track when it comes to the economy and tariffs. He promised tariffs would fill the U.S. Treasury, create millions of manufacturing jobs, and be paid by foreign countries. He insisted he could impose these tariffs without an act of Congress, and he would complete trade deals with 200 countries. He promised to end the war in Ukraine on Day 1, that Putin really wants to make a deal, and would soon stop attacking. He promised to reduce prices on Day 1.

None of this happened.

It doesn’t really matter whether the president knows he is lying, or is just delusional, believing whatever passes through his mind in any given moment. He is acting like a fool. What is more disturbing is the entire leadership of the Republican party seems willing to go along with this. It won’t end well.

ONEOK, Inc. is a leading midstream energy company with a substantial footprint in natural gas and NGL infrastructure, operating over 17,500 miles of gathering pipelines and significant storage facilities. The company’s strategy focuses on essential energy infrastructure, supporting a competitive dividend yield. ONEOK’s scale, geographic reach, and integrated asset base enable it to serve producers and end users throughout major U.S. energy markets.

Foolish Take

Benson Investment Management’s new $5.4 million position in ONEOK adds exposure to energy infrastructure in a portfolio largely dominated by tech and metals. While the midstream operator’s shares have slid nearly 30% over the past year, Benson’s buy comes as the company posts strong underlying fundamentals and strong earnings growth.

In the second quarter of 2025, ONEOK reported net income of $853 million, up 9% year over year, and a 22% rise in adjusted EBITDA to roughly $2 billion, supported by higher volumes due largely to increased production in the mid-continent and Rocky Mountain regions. The firm is targeting $8 billion to $8.45 billion in full-year adjusted EBITDA and maintains a $4.12 annualized dividend, reinforcing its reputation as a stable, fee-based cash generator.

For Benson, ONEOK offers diversification and yield at a time when most top holdings—like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia—derive value from growth rather than income. The company next reports earnings on October 29.

The Healey-Driscoll administration stated that this funding pause will delay critical work in detecting and removing lead from drinking water systems across Massachusetts. Since 2022, the state has provided over $102 million to identify and replace lead service lines in approximately 160 communities.

Using existing grant funding, municipalities have recently completed 70 inventories by identifying lead service lines that remain in use. In March 2025, the Trump administration also delayed over $50 million in funds from the 2024 Lead Grant allocation project.

“Massachusetts has some of the oldest housing stock and water infrastructure in the nation, and lead service lines remain a threat to public health, particularly for young children,” said Governor Maura Healey. “The Trump Administration fails to understand the importance of supporting local projects to get lead out of our drinking water. This funding stimulates the economy with construction jobs, replaces outdated infrastructure, and most importantly, ensures that residents are drinking safe, clean water. The delay and uncertainty with announcing the new allotments have forced us to pause our Lead Service Line Replacement Program and pause these much-needed projects.”

Funding is allocated to the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The trust then partners with municipalities to select priority projects and ensure completion of critical programs.

“Once again, the Trump administration is delaying urgently needed funds and putting the health and safety of our children and their families at risk,” said State Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg, Chair of the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust. “These resources are essential to addressing a serious public health crisis. I strongly urge the EPA to release this critical funding to protect the well-being of people throughout every one of our communities.”

They used to say that politics is the art of the possible. Today, politics is the art of believing the impossible.

Think about the Gaza peace plan, rioting against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, cashless bail and transgenderism. On each, some would rather embrace comforting illusions than face unpleasant realities.

Confidence in the Gaza peace plan shows an unwillingness to take savages at their word, even when their word is written in blood. We are expected to believe that Hamas is now willing to lay down its arms and leave the Gaza Strip when its entire existence has been dedicated to the annihilation of the Jewish people.

Its charter calls for genocide. It has never negotiated with Israel directly but always through intermediaries. It’s never acknowledged Israel’s right to exist within any borders. On Oct. 7, 2023, it perpetrated the greatest one-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Whatever happens, Hamas will never give up and the misnamed peace process will leave Israel much more vulnerable.

The same air of unreality dominates the discussion of the terrorist war on ICE. In Portland, Oregon, the chaos has been going on for more than 100 days. Every night, protesters who look like demons summoned from the depths of hell attack ICE facilities.

In Chicago earlier this month, an ICE vehicle was rammed by up to 10 cars. Agents barely escaped with their lives, and Mayor Brandon Johnson, whose grasp of reality is tenuous at best, ordered police to stand down.

Attacks on immigration officers have increased 1,000% since Jan. 21. Drug cartels have placed $10,000 bounties on the heads of immigration enforcement officials.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker calls the president’s efforts to enforce federal immigration law and get violent illegal aliens off the streets an “invasion.” In a recent statement, he urged “every American [to] speak up and help stop this madness.”

Enforcing the law and deporting the worst of the worst have become the Trump invasion.

The same politicians who were telling us the border was secure two years ago (as millions of people crossed illegally into the United States) today insist that violent upheaval is lawful protest and there is no cause for alarm.

Elsewhere, crime continues to surge.

Cashless bail has helped paint city streets blood red, but the liberal Brennan Center for Justice insists, “There is no evidence connecting bail reform with crime rates.” Really?

A first-of-its-kind study by the Yolo County, California, district attorney’s office found a 169% increase in recidivism under no-cash bail. In early September, a ghastly murder, caught on camera, brought the issue into sharp focus. A 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee riding on public transportation in Charlotte, North Carolina, was stabbed to death.

Decarlos Brown Jr., who was charged with the crime, had 14 prior arrests over the course of two decades. The last time he was in court before Iryna Zarutska’s murder, a magistrate released him on his promise to show up for trial.

Nowhere is political schizophrenia more evident than in transgenderism.

Early this month, a Biden-appointed judge sentenced Nicholas Roske, who tried to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, to a surprisingly lenient eight years in prison. The Department of Justice had asked for 30 years. Among other mitigating circumstances that Judge Deborah Boardman considered was Roske’s so-called transgender identity. (He says he is someone called Sophie.)

The idea that someone can change their gender by changing their name or getting hormone treatment or surgery is self-evidently absurd. Nothing can alter DNA.

Yet men are allowed to play in women’s sports and boys are allowed into girls’ locker rooms on as little as a declaration that they “identify” as female.

The movement behind the fantasy is responsible for possibly irreversible operations performed on minors.

No wonder there’s so much rage here. Transgenderism provided the motivation for at least two school shootings and the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Illusions can be deadly.

As the left’s grip on our culture tightens, we march ever deeper into the happy land of make believe: Oz, Narnia and Neverland combined.

Don’t forget: In office, President Biden was at the top of his game, Hunter Biden’s laptop wasn’t real but the Steele dossier was and the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack was the worst act of insurrection since the firing on Fort Sumter.

It used to be that seeing is believing. Now it’s: Who are you going to believe, your lying eyes, your deceitful brain or our good old reliable elites?

By inviting world leaders, Trump seeks to project an image of dominance and international legitimacy, much like he did during his White House tenure.

Within the context of the Sharm El-Sheikh summit, issues such as identifying the aggressor, punishment, and compensation for the victims in Gaza have been sidelined. Legal and international bodies have accused Israel of genocide and war crimes; the International Criminal Court (ICC) is also active in this regard. However, the West seeks to downplay legal accountability by emphasizing the ceasefire and magnifying the appearance of peace.

Trump’s peace plan, which promised a permanent ceasefire, Hamas disarmament, and Gaza’s reconstruction, quickly faced resistance from the main parties. Hamas announced it would not attend the signing ceremony, and Israel stated it would not participate either. This response indicates that the current ceasefire is a tactical point rather than a fundamental and lasting agreement.

The Sharm El-Sheikh summit may serve merely to postpone subsequent U.S. initiatives. Trump appears intent on preparing the ground for future interventions, potentially shifting regional focus to other areas, such as Venezuela. This scenario represents a repeat of Washington’s “regional distraction” strategy, which it employs to advance its long-term objectives.

Photos and videos are available in the Greenpeace Media Library.

The messages Greenpeace Brazil projected on the Congress building and on buildings across Brasília, where delegates are meeting, read “COP 30: Act for forests, act for climate” in English; “COP30: Protejam as florestas” in Portuguese.

A staggering 86% of people surveyed in 17 countries across five continents believe that protecting forests is critical in the fight against climate change, according to the new poll, released today, commissioned by Greenpeace International and conducted by Opinium [1]. Results also showed that 82% of people want their governments to take more action on forests, showing overwhelming public support to halt deforestation.

An Lambrechts, Biodiversity Policy Expert, Greenpeace International said: “If we want to keep 1.5°C within sight, COP30 will need to deliver an action plan to end forest destruction by 2030. These poll results show that many people understand the urgency and want governments to act. There is no better moment than at a COP in the Amazon to do so.”

The polling was released during the pre-COP in Brasília, where country delegations, Indigenous communities and civil society are meeting ahead of the UNFCCC COP30 to prepare COP outcomes, including on the need to address climate change and biodiversity loss hand in hand.

Poll respondents expressed wanting to see their governments increasingly addressing forest destruction. Additionally, most agree that the most effective results can be achieved with global cooperation through international agreements to end deforestation (77%), and to commit to a new action plan to halt the destruction of forests and other ecosystems (75%). When it comes to forest protection, respondents place the most confidence in Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (78%), well above national governments (49%) or corporations (42%). 75% agree that Indigenous Peoples should receive funding to protect forests.

Carolina Pasquali, Executive Director, Greenpeace Brazil said: “This overwhelming public support sends a powerful message to governments ahead of COP30, which takes place for the first time in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. World leaders must listen to their people and act on their moral, legal and political responsibilities to end deforestation in order to hold on to the 1.5°C ambition.”

Kleber Karipuna, Executive Coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib) said: “This is a significant survey as it expresses not only the opinion of the vast majority of the population on the importance of keeping forests and all biomes standing and preserved, but also reveals society’s trust in Indigenous Peoples to protect the planet’s biodiversity. Science has already proven that Indigenous Peoples are the true guardians of the forest. Now, society is reaffirming this and warning that demarcating and protecting our territories is an effective and crucial policy for combating deforestation and confronting the global climate crisis, because we are the answer.”

For successful forest protection, Greenpeace calls on global leaders at Pre-COP to:

Act on their commitments and the UNFCCC target to halt deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, with a decision that goes beyond voluntary pledges [2].

Provide direct funding for Indigenous Peoples’ and Local Communities’ solutions to protect and restore forests.

Regulate and stop funding those who profit from forest destruction.

“Nigeria’s energy future is not a choice between opportunity and risk; it is a challenge to navigate both dynamics together,” he said.
“Success demands a multi-pronged strategy that leverages our strengths while confronting our vulnerabilities head-on.” Dr. Ogah framed Nigeria’s energy path as one of managing both opportunity and risk with discipline.
The business leader outlined the main risks undermining energy development as policy inconsistency, infrastructure gaps, security concerns, and skills shortages.
On human capital, he proposed the creation of a National Energy Transition Academy and issued a strong caution against industrial unrest, referencing the recent PENGASSAN and Dangote Refinery dispute.","President of Masters Energy Group and former Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Uchechukwu Ogah, has asserted that Nigeria’s energy future is contingent upon effectively balancing significant reforms with practical national realities, urging stakeholders to harmonise policy, investment, and innovation to achieve sustainable growth.

Speaking at the NAEC Energy Conference 2025, on the theme “Nigeria’s Energy Future: Optimising Opportunities and Addressing Risks for Sustainable Growth”, Dr. Ogah called for pragmatic reforms and sustained policy consistency to drive Nigeria’s energy transition.

Ogah acknowledged the transformative potential of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) of 2021 and the Electricity Act of 2023, noting that successful implementation would require deliberate coordination across government and industry.

“Nigeria’s energy future is not a choice between opportunity and risk; it is a challenge to navigate both dynamics together,” he said. “Success demands a multi-pronged strategy that leverages our strengths while confronting our vulnerabilities head-on.”

Dr. Ogah framed Nigeria’s energy path as one of managing both opportunity and risk with discipline. He referenced a Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) report indicating that national power generation remains below 50 percent of installed capacity due to gas constraints and transmission bottlenecks.

He identified three paramount challenges: ensuring reforms yield measurable results, maximising the value of hydrocarbon assets before the global decline accelerates, and providing affordable power to all citizens.

The Masters Energy boss emphasised that oil and gas remain the economy’s backbone, accounting for nearly 70 percent of export earnings and sustaining millions of jobs.

He stressed that gas commercialisation, through projects like the Utorogu Gas Processing Facility, is vital, describing gas as Nigeria’s strategic bridge fuel that powers industries, enables clean cooking, and can position the nation as an LNG export leader.

However, he warned that underinvestment, oil theft, and insecurity pose serious threats to the full implementation of the PIA.

Dr. Ogah stated that the global energy transition offers Nigeria the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century, highlighting the nation’s significant potential in solar, wind, and youthful human capital.

He urged the country to exceed its 30 percent renewable capacity target by 2030, arguing that inaction would risk turning Nigeria into a consumer or dumping ground for imported technologies.

He passionately declared, “We must not be consumers of the green economy; we must be creators within it.”

Dr. Ogah commended the Association of Energy Correspondents of Nigeria (NAEC) for maintaining vital dialogue across government, industry, and the media regarding the nation’s energy transformation.

He pinpointed three major growth frontiers: gas, renewables, and innovation.

He advocated for the development of utility-scale solar farms, mini-grids, and local solar manufacturing under the proposed Nigerian Solar Manufacturing Initiative. Furthermore, he identified blue hydrogen, biofuels, and critical mineral exploration as crucial pathways for industrial diversification, underscoring that every solution, “from solar in Olorunsogo to blue hydrogen in the Delta,” must serve both growth and sustainability.

The business leader outlined the main risks undermining energy development as policy inconsistency, infrastructure gaps, security concerns, and skills shortages.

He called for practical solutions, including establishing a single-window licensing system, modernising the national grid, and implementing benefit-sharing models to enhance investor confidence and community trust, observing that policy certainty attracts capital; community trust protects it.

On human capital, he proposed the creation of a National Energy Transition Academy and issued a strong caution against industrial unrest, referencing the recent PENGASSAN and Dangote Refinery dispute.

Dr. Ogah concluded that energy reform is a national, joint project, urging industry players to align with ESG principles, the government to deepen reform consistency, and journalists to sustain solution-driven energy reporting.

He rallied stakeholders toward a unified vision: “By optimising today’s hydrocarbon assets and building tomorrow’s clean-energy ecosystem, we can fuel sustainable growth for every Nigerian.”",http://www.environewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG-20251012-WA0011.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 16:01:05.663488

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who’ve lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

I want to take it back, I was wrong. Not just because UCLA went on to crush Michigan State for its second consecutive win — I guess the Bruins’ interim offensive coordinator figured out how to use his headset — but Northwestern beat Penn State yesterday, and as a Northwestern fan, I now feel strongly that it’s important to celebrate the team that pulls off an upset instead of just crapping all over the team that lost.

Is Penn State really in total freefall, or was it just outfoxed by the mighty Wildcat defense? Come on, guys! Isn’t it more fun to talk about how Northwestern’s offense is clicking with Preston Stone and Griffin Wilde than something boring like James Franklin’s job status? Guys? GUYS?!?!??!?!?!

HOOSIER DADDY

Four years ago, in the midst of a 38-3 loss to Rutgers, several hundred Indiana students ripped off their shirts and began jumping around the completely empty upper deck of Memorial Stadium, overcome with mass-onset Hoosier Madness:

That moment was easily the most most memorable thing about the 2021 Indiana Hoosiers, who finished 2-10 and 0-9 in conference play. Indiana experienced a glimmer of relevance during the 2020 COVID season, but it was still the losingest program in college football history, without a bowl win since 1991. The Hoosiers had no hope and no ambition — nothing to do except rip their shirts off and mosh, as far away as possible from the actual football taking place on the field.

Four years later, Indiana is still the losingest program in college football history, and it still hasn’t won a bowl game since 1991. And yet the undefeated Hoosiers have arguably the strongest resume of any team in the country. They are virtual locks to play in the Big Ten championship and the College Football Playoff after comfortably defeating #3 Oregon in Eugene.

The win was Indiana’s first over a Top 5 opponent since 1967. It had gone 0-46 against Top 5 competition over the previous 58 years. And the Hoosiers didn’t win a flukey, NCAA Tournament-style upset in which the underdog keeps hitting threes and the better team keeps missing layups. (Basketball terms for our adapting Hoosier friends.) Indiana was simply the better team. The Hoosiers moved the ball consistently, tracked down Oregon quarterback Dante Moore like Hoosier homing missiles, and stoned the Ducks in multiple short-yardage scenarios. If not for an atypical Fernando Mendoza pick-six, literally his first interception of the year, the game wouldn’t have been particularly close.

Indiana’s overnight leap in success from 2023 to 2024 was one of the biggest in college football history. Curt Cignetti and his transfers took Indiana to the College Football Playoff out of nowhere in their first year in Bloomington. But Indiana may have taken a bigger leap in Year 2, going from a solid team that was clearly outclassed by the best programs in the sport to a legit national title contender.

Going from bad to good quickly has happened before. Going from good to elite typically takes significantly longer, and requires major structural changes. Just ask Oregon, which has risen from football obscurity to powerhouse status through decades of strategic planning and billions of dollars invested by a single benefactor, the founder and CEO of the largest athletic clothing brand ever. Oregon couldn’t break through overnight. It has had to build wisely by hiring the right people and spending in the right ways, creating systems that would enable it to beat the best teams in the sport. In 2025, the Ducks looked as if they finally made it to the top: They had the right coach, who was able to land the best recruits from all over the country and get them to buy in.

And then Indiana came into their house and kicked their asses with a year-and-a-half of Curt Cignetti and nothing else. These Hoosiers aren’t the result of careful planning. They are just four years removed from being so directionless and incoherent that “shirtless dance party?” was a defining ethos.

Indiana can win the national championship. It hasn’t shown any flaws and, unlike last year, its schedule isn’t lacking. The Hoosiers entered this week as the #3 team in Bill Connelly’s SP+ ratings and just beat the #1 team on the road. Indiana’s opponents this year are 22-4 against Not Indiana, and 0-6 against Indiana.

I can’t explain how Indiana did it. I have no road map for the next team who wants to replicate its success, because there’s only one Curt Cignetti and Indiana already hired him. But Oklahoma State fans had the next-best idea this weekend: A random Shirtless Section during Saturday’s 39-17 loss to Houston in a cargo cult attempt at recreating Indiana’s rise.

See you in the 2030 national championship game, Pokes.

Fun fact about the Hoosier Madness incident: Our friend, Mr. Homefield Apparel, was in the crowd that day, watching all those freezing, frenzied students and all those Rutgers touchdowns:

It was that day that Mr. Homefield came up with an idea: What if people could cover their upper bodies in some form of garment? Perhaps made out some sort of cloth or fabric? Not only could these “shirts” provide warmth and comfort to the wearer, they could feature words or images that represent things the wearer is passionate about.

Everything has changed in the past few years. Indiana has become a national contender. Homefield’s invention of “shirts” has been copied by rival brands, but everybody agrees that they are the originator and the best. They’ve even expanded to products such as their new Homefield Varsity Jackets, which are SICK. (Oregon fans, cheer yourself up with that vintage Duck!)

Oops, they did it again

If its loss to UCLA was an alarm, Penn State hit snooze. It looked just as flat and lifeless against Northwestern as it did the week before. Perhaps even worse. The Nittany Lions started putting up points after falling into a hole against the Bruins. On Saturday they never woke up.

Penn State is now the first team ever to lose back-to-back games as a 20-point favorite. It won’t be a 20-point favorite again this season, especially after quarterback Drew Allar went down with a season-ending injury.

Normally, when I hear people doom-and-glooming about a couple of weird losses, I think they’re being overreactive … but considering the context around Penn State, the reaction feels appropriate. This season was supposed to be the culmination of talent and program-building under 12th-year head coach James Franklin. When I previewed Penn State for Split Zone Duo’s Big Ten preview, I saw a complete team with elite, experienced players at virtually every position. Allar seemed poised for a star turn in his final season after years of development. The biggest question mark was the receiver room, so Penn State spent big on multiple high-quality transfer receivers to plug the gap.

This season was everything Penn State was building towards … and in two weeks, it has crumbled and collapsed.

A Smart move

I’m trying to decide: Is Kirby Smart a liar, a genius, or a just really convincing salesman?

On a key third down in the fourth quarter against Auburn, Smart sprinted towards the officials signaling “timeout.” The refs granted Georgia a timeout with one second on the play clock, preventing a delay of game. However, Smart told the officials that he actually wasn’t timeout. He explained that he was just clapping at them, and in their confusion, they misinterpreted his hand gestures. The officials, remarkably, bought the explanation, and did not charge Georgia with a timeout. The Bulldogs got a fresh play clock, which is the intended effect of calling a timeout, without actually having to use one.

Here’s the weird thing: Smart may have been telling the truth. Yes, he was clearly running down the sidelines doing the “timeout” gesture. But he explained after the game that he was trying to tell the referees that Auburn players were clapping before the snap to trick Georgia into snapping the ball early, simulating the claps the Bulldogs were using to trigger the snap in a loud road environment. Smart said he alerted officials to Auburn’s use of this illegal trick before the game, and that he’d lost games at Auburn because of it. (Not sure which games Kirby is referring to, but Auburn did use a clap to trick Alabama into a bad snap during the Iron Bowl in 2023, setting up a fourth-and-31 … which Alabama famously converted!)

And sure enough, if you look at the play in question, Auburn defenders were clapping before the snap! The Tigers should’ve been given a five-yard penalty.

So I’m a little confused. On one hand, I believe Kirby Smart when he says he was trying to get in the refs’ ears about Auburn’s clapping. The Tigers clearly have a history of doing it, they were clearly doing it Saturday, and Smart is clearly fed up with it. I’m a little skeptical that Kirby would freak out so aggressively just to trick the refs into giving him one free timeout, especially with so much time remaining.

But on the other hand … we have the video, and he was clearly making the timeout gesture and not clapping.

One thing is clear: Auburn can’t stay away from bad officiating scenarios. It had a goal line QB sneak that kinda looked like a touchdown turn into a fumble on Saturday night. And of course, they were on the wrong end of this:

I guess Hugh Freeze freaking out at officials gives them the ick and convinces them to make even more calls against Auburn, and Kirby Smart freaking out at officials causes them to rethink the calls they’ve already made. A useful skill!

Oklahoma rushed QB John Mateer back from surgery on his throwing hand for the big Red River matchup with Texas … and he looked like a guy who got rushed back from surgery on his throwing hand as Oklahoma lost, 23-6.

UNLV stayed undefeated by beating Air Force, 51-48, and has a legit chance at the G6 spot in the College Football Playoff. Air Force is now dead last in the nation in total defense, allowing 497 yards per game. Honestly, I’m a bit worried about our national security at this point.

I’m not writing about the latest embarrassing Bill Belichick loss … because UNC was on bye. We’ll be back next week.

Boise State pulled off the extremely rare botched snap-to-touchdown pass Saturday night. I honestly can’t remember the last time I saw this …

This sort of thing used to happen more often when teams used backup quarterbacks to hold kicks in case the snap went bad and they needed a QB to make a play. But now teams use full-time long snappers who are almost always perfect, and most use a punter as the holder because it’s just easier to let the special teams guys hang out with each other in practice. Long story short: This was an Aussie Rules convert, Oscar Doyle, likely throwing a pass for the first time, under extreme duress … and dropping in a perfectly placed pass with touch on the run!

Oregon State wishes they could do this. The Beavers have had the most disastrous special teams season in recent memory with a variety of blocked kicks, allowed return touchdowns, and missed field goals. They tried to fix their problems by firing their special teams coordinator … and had yet another kick blocked on Saturday.

I’m still stumping for the two-QB offense. Look at this play Washington State ran for a touchdown against Ole Miss:

The ball was snapped to backup QB Julian Dugger, who handed it off to starter Zevi Eckhaus, who the defense clearly read as a runner rather than a QB. He briefly faked an option look before wheeling around and tossing a TD to a wide-open receiver.

Iowa State’s starting kicker was hurt entering Saturday, and then its backup kicker got hurt mid-game. So the Cyclones turned to Carson Rhodes, a 310-pound offensive lineman who punted and played soccer in high school.

Can we get any footage of this 310-pound guy playing soccer?

Kent State won its first game against another FBS team since 2022 … and it wasn’t close! The Golden Flashes beat UMass, 42-6. The winless Minutemen seem significantly worse than any other team at this level.","https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/ERo1bP2tDqs",N,,2025-10-12 14:02:39.022565

DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor Co. on Thursday said it won’t file for federal plug-in vehicle tax credits for transactions after the program’s deadline, following a similar decision by General Motors Co.

The Dearborn automaker will continue to offer its current lease rates to customers but will not claim the tax credit of up to $7,500. The incentive ended on Sept. 30, but Ford and GM through their finance arms found a workaround to extend that taxpayer-funded discount.

Following pressure from Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican and former auto dealer, to abandon the scheme, however, both companies have withdrawn their plans.

“Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today to continue providing customers with more affordable electric vehicle options,” Ford spokesperson Said Deep said in a statement. “For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0% financing for 72 months and other incentives.”

The automakers had their finance arms put down payments on dealers’ in-stock electric vehicles ahead of the deadline in an effort to extend the discount. CEO Jim Farley had characterized it as a way to “transition” customers away from the government incentive.

Now the companies will foot the discount themselves. Ford’s EV lease deals are expected to extend through the rest of the year. GM said on Wednesday it will offer its discount of up to $6,000 through October.",https://www.limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/135497127_web1_Ford-Logo-1024x409.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 14:01:31.777393

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that India will remain a major export hub for onshore wind components, underscoring the country's expanding role in the global renewable energy supply chain. ""Since 2023, the share of Western OEMs in the domestic market has declined sharply – from over 50% on average between 2018 and 2022 to below 5% – as their focus shifted to core US and European markets. This has left several gigawatts of manufacturing capacity underutilised and oriented towards exports. At the same time, Indian and Chinese manufacturers are planning expansions, says IEA. For the first time, large-scale supply contracts have been awarded to Chinese manufacturers in India and several other countries. India currently boasts more than 20GW of wind turbine manufacturing capacity, catering to both domestic demand and export markets. The country India has established itself as a global manufacturing hub for WTG components, with a strong supplier network and expanding capacities across key Tier 1 (nacelle, blade, tower) and Tier 2 (gearbox, generator, converter, casting) segments, ensuring global competitiveness, according to Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). India stands at the threshold of becoming a global hub for wind manufacturing — where localisation goes beyond producing turbines and supply chain components for the domestic market. The focus is now on building global competitiveness through advanced capabilities, a skilled workforce, and strong local supply chains,"" Francis Jayasurya, director, GWEC India told TOI. Indian manufacturers account for about 12% of the global nacelle manufacturing capacity, contributing roughly 20GW out of a global total exceeding 165GW. In blade manufacturing, India holds a 10% share, with a capacity of around 16GW from a global base of more than 157GW. For towers, Indian firms contribute 13%, amounting to about 15GW of the global capacity exceeding 115GW. The country's strongest presence is in gearboxes, where it commands 17% of global capacity, equivalent to 29GW out of more than 170GW worldwide, says GWEC data. India aims for 500GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030, including 100GW from wind (30GW offshore).

Houston has the worst power outages in the nation; how bad is it in your ZIP code? | KPRC Houston

Some zip codes in the Houston area had as many as seven outages in August. There were no hurricanes, no historic heat waves – just a lot of blue-sky outages.

In this story from KPRC, Senator Lois Kolkhorst pledged to do something about it. Good – except Senators said they’d do something about utility failures after Beryl and did very little.

It’s time the Legislature prioritizes pay for performance: give utilities both upside and downside risk based on the total amount of outages and speed to restore service after a storm.

The government’s own data rebuts Trump’s claims about wind and solar prices | Politico

The Administration continues to make demonstrably false claims about renewables. Politico did an excellent job putting together the evidence.

“Adding more wind and solar to the grid have one guaranteed effect: They make electricity more expensive,” Wright, a former oil industry CEO, told reporters last month in Washington.

But federal energy data undermines those arguments.

“I really think the data say pretty much the opposite” of Wright’s claims, said Joshua Rhodes, an electricity grid expert at the University of Texas-Austin whose research has found that renewable power has lowered electricity prices for customers in Texas, a state where wind and solar produce more than 30 percent of the state’s mix.

According to the EIA figures, Texas’ power cost an average of 10.24 cents per kilowatt-hour in June of this year. That price was lower than electricity costs in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and seven other Southern states. Only Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma had cheaper power in the South.

More broadly, EIA data shows that states that have been the quickest to add wind and solar generation to the grid have had lower power prices.

A majority of the 32 states with the fastest rising renewable resources voted for Trump and have Republican governors. The Administration’s policies will hurt those states.

And it’s not just renewables the Administration is hurting…

High natural gas prices and skyrocketing electricity demands from AI workloads are pushing operators toward this carbon-intensive option, according to a recent report from The Register. The publication highlights how utilities in regions like the Midwest and Appalachia are delaying coal plant retirements or even ramping up production to meet the surge, with data centers projected to consume up to 8% of U.S. electricity by 2030.

This shift comes amid broader industry pressures, where tech giants like Google and Microsoft are racing to expand their computing infrastructure. The irony is stark: companies pledging net-zero emissions are indirectly bolstering the dirtiest fossil fuel, as coal’s reliability trumps intermittent renewables in the short term.

The AI Boom’s Hidden Energy Cost

Analysts at Jefferies, as cited in The Register’s analysis, note that natural gas prices have spiked 50% in the past year due to export demands and supply constraints, making coal economically viable again. Data centers, which can require gigawatts of power equivalent to small cities, are negotiating direct deals with utilities to secure stable supplies, often at the expense of cleaner alternatives.

Environmental advocates warn this could undermine U.S. climate goals, with coal emissions potentially rising 10-15% in key states by 2026. Yet, for operators, the math is simple: AI training models demand constant, uninterruptible power that solar or wind can’t always guarantee without massive battery backups.

Utilities Adapt to Surging Demand

The Department of Energy’s latest report, referenced in related coverage, forecasts domestic data center energy use doubling by 2028, driven by generative AI. This has utilities like those in Virginia and Texas extending coal plant lifespans, with some facilities that were slated for shutdown now being retrofitted to serve hyperscale campuses.

Industry insiders point to specific examples, such as Rainbow Energy’s plans in North Dakota to power a 300MW data center directly from the state’s largest coal plant, as detailed in reports from Data Center Dynamics. Such colocation strategies minimize transmission losses but lock in fossil fuel dependence.

Balancing Innovation and Sustainability

Tech firms are not idle; investments in nuclear small modular reactors and geothermal energy are accelerating, but these solutions won’t scale until the 2030s. In the interim, coal fills the gap, with global data center electricity demand expected to double by 2026, per the International Energy Agency’s findings echoed in The Register.

Critics argue this is a short-sighted fix, potentially inflating energy costs and regulatory scrutiny. For instance, Duke Energy’s updated carbon plan gambles on coal for data center growth, citing Trump-era rollbacks on pollution rules, as reported by NC Newsline.

Looking Ahead: Policy and Tech Intersections

As the sector evolves, collaborations like Babcock & Wilcox’s agreements to convert coal plants to gas hybrids signal transitional paths, though full decarbonization remains elusive. The McKinsey report on AI’s power hunger underscores opportunities for investors in resilient infrastructure, but warns of grid strains without coordinated policy.

Ultimately, this coal resurgence tests the tech industry’s green commitments, forcing a reckoning between rapid innovation and environmental responsibility. With AI’s exponential growth showing no signs of slowing, stakeholders must navigate these tensions to forge a more sustainable path forward.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-fdfcf03b-da8a-4e45-8ce0-943dd4854932.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 15:01:31.797803

Kinew says in a letter to Mark Carney on Saturday that while he believes protecting Canada's vehicle industry is important, he says the country's approach ""has created a two-front trade war that disproportionally affects Western Canada.""

The premier says in the letter that China's tariffs — widely seen as a response to Canada imposing the electric vehicle levy — have already caused a sharp drop in canola prices and that one vertically integrated pork producer in Manitoba is reporting a $19 million negative impact on an annual basis.

Canada imposed the electric vehicle duty last year in lockstep with the United States, which also has a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles, with Canada arguing the measure is meant to protect the country's automobile industry.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has previously said he wanted Ottawa to do away with the electric vehicle tariff, but only if the country remained on good terms with the United States, and he has since said removing it would not be a simple fix.

Kinew says every day the tariffs remain in place, the harm to Prairie producers deepens.

""Canada's trade policy must balance long-term industrial goals and national security with immediate economic realities as well as the national responsibility to grow every region of Canada's economy ,"" Kinew said in his letter to Carney.

Kinew noted that the Chinese ambassador to Canada also recently said that China would be prepared to lift its tariffs on canola and pork in exchange for Canada removing the tax on Chinese electric vehicles.

CTV reported that Wang Di made the pledge through an interpreter during an interview for its program Question Period, which aired Sunday morning.

Kinew called it a ""critical moment"" and urged Carney's government to ""seize the opportunity.""

The ambassador said in an opinion piece posted on the embassy's website Thursday that the tariff on Chinese-made EVs contravenes World Trade Organization rules, and removing it ""will once again highlight the image that Canada has been trying to establish as an advocate for a rules-based international economic and trade order.""

China charges a 76 per cent tariff on Canadian canola seed imports and a 100 per cent tariff on canola oil, meal and peas. China also put a 25 per cent tariff on certain Canadian pork, fish and seafood products.

Ottawa has accused Beijing of unfairly subsidizing its electric vehicle industry and flooding international markets with cheap cars to gain a competitive advantage.

Ottawa said last month it was reviewing its decision to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, but is offering no clarity on when the review started or when it might conclude.

The tariffs took effect on Oct. 1, 2024.

At the time, the regulatory order introducing them stated the measure would be reviewed within one year of implementation.

Figures last week show Saskatchewan's canola exports to China have taken a nosedive, with data showing that Saskatchewan's exports to China fell to $96 million in August, a 76 per cent drop when compared with the same month last year.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a letter to Carney last month that Canada must maintain its 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles as Ottawa looks to secure a new trade deal with the U.S. and protect Canada's auto sector.

Why solar is the practical answer Egypt still makes most of its electricity from natural gas.
By May 2025, Egypt had about 7.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewables (solar, wind, and hydro combined).
As for newer projects, on 15 June 2025, Egypt secured financing for a 1-GW solar plant with Scatec, the largest solar developer in Egypt.
Why Egypt’s sun gives solar an edge Egypt is also a naturally sunny place to tune more to this natural resource.","You wake up in the small hours, the air is thick, and the fan has stopped. Or you are halfway through an online class, a meeting, or a study session, and the screen goes black. That was the soundtrack of last summer for many homes across Egypt, as scheduled power cuts moved from rumour to routine.

The pattern had a cause. In the summer of 2024, and again in 2025, a fierce heatwave hit Egypt, putting a toll on electricity. The government in June 2024 resorted to three-hour power cuts while it scrambled for extra fuel. This is called “load-shedding”, a scheduled switch-off of electricity to save fuel.

To plug the gap of fuel shortage, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly stated in June 2024 that Egypt needed USD 1.18 billion worth of fuel (EGP 56.6 billion). Officials said the cuts would stop in July 2024 once extra gas shipments arrived. The message was simple: when gas is tight, lights go off or the fuel bill jumps.

Why solar is the practical answer

Egypt still makes most of its electricity from natural gas. When local gas falls short, the country buys Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from abroad. Egypt is negotiating LNG supplies with Qatar, Algeria, and Saudi Arabia, and has signed deals with Shell and Total Energies for cargoes in early 2025. In 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that Egypt is buying more LNG and chartering three extra FSRUs (floating terminals that turn LNG back into gas) to cover demand. The Cabinet also said Egypt would import LNG from July 2025 to June 2026 to get through the next summer. These steps keep the grid running, but they are expensive compared with building more local solar.

The strategic answer is to raise the share of clean power. In 2023, the government revealed its plans for renewables to supply 42 percent of Egypt’s electricity by 2030. Today, renewables supply about 11.5 percent of Egypt’s electricity, as per the latest government figure reiterated publicly at COP27 in late 2024, meaning the country would need to roughly quadruple the share of clean power in the mix by 2030 to meet its goal.

In late 2024, Madbouly called for global finance to upgrade the grid. Hitting the 42 percent target means adding big solar and wind plants and also connecting smaller systems on rooftops, schools, and businesses.

By May 2025, Egypt had about 7.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewables (solar, wind, and hydro combined). A year earlier, the country had roughly 7.4 GW; 4.6 GW of wind and solar, plus 2.8 GW of hydropower. In plain terms: total clean capacity grew year-on-year, even after the big wave of solar construction at Benban earlier in the decade. The Benban Solar Park near Aswan remains the anchor of Egypt’s solar fleet, together producing about 1.5–1.65 GW for the national grid.

As for newer projects, on 15 June 2025, Egypt secured financing for a 1-GW solar plant with Scatec, the largest solar developer in Egypt. Together, they signed a USD 600 million (EGP 28.8 billion) investment and a power-purchase agreement for 900 MW of wind worth USD 1 billion (EGP 48 billion).

Smaller systems matter as well. Homes, shops, and campuses can connect under net metering, which means you use your solar power first and send any extra to the grid for credits on your bill. They are most effective for users with significant daytime consumption and in tariff bands where daytime rates are higher. The regulator’s current tariff table, in force since 1 September 2024, shows what you pay per kilowatt-hour on each band, so heavy daytime users (workshops, clinics, schools) can see their likely payback more clearly.

Why Egypt’s sun gives solar an edge

Egypt is also a naturally sunny place to tune more to this natural resource. National and World Bank-backed tools show strong solar resources: around 3,000 hours of sunshine a year in many areas, and high solar radiation from the Nile Valley to Upper Egypt. More sun hours and stronger radiation mean each panel can generate more electricity.

Yet, there is still a bottleneck to solve: the grid. Think of the grid as the “roads and bridges” of electricity: the big pylons (high-voltage lines) and substations that carry power from where it is made (Benban in Upper Egypt, wind in the Gulf of Suez) to where it is used (Cairo, the Delta, industrial zones). Currently, those “roads” are busy, and some stretches are too narrow for the extra traffic from new solar and wind plants. That is why even with lots of sunshine and ready investors, projects can be delayed until there is space on the lines.

First, less than 12 percent of Egypt’s nearly 60 GW of installed capacity was renewable as of mid-2024, meaning most power still came from gas and older plants. Second, the national renewables total did rise 0.3 GW year-on-year, from mid-2024 Mid 2025; however, to reach the desired 42 percent by 2030, a lot more new projects must be plugged in quicker than the infrastructure can currently cater.

Officials say they are fast-tracking clean-energy connections through the Under Egypt’s Nexus for Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) platform so priority projects can feed power into the network before peak summer demand.

To make that possible, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (EBRD) is in parallel financing a grid-reinforcement project. A new 500 kV substation in Cairo and about 200 km of new 500 kV lines, which will move solar from Upper Egypt, where it’s sunny, and wind from the coastal area into areas of major loads.

The bank’s documents describe the substation as “crucial for the stability of the network” and say the upgrade is directly linked to closing the Shoubra El-Kheima gas plant without risking supply. In simple terms; more high-voltage lines in addition to bigger substations result in more room for solar and wind to flow, fewer bottlenecks, and less need for emergency fuel in hot months. Without these wires and substations, new solar fields cannot deliver their power to homes or shops, even if the panels are already in the desert.

Put simply, last year’s blackouts showed the cost of relying on gas alone. This year’s plan is to buy time with imported fuel while adding more solar and wind, large and small, and strengthening the grid that carries them.",https://egyptianstreets.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 16:01:20.778339

“This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.” WILMINGTON, Del.
In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.
“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said.
Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source.","“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Matt Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.”

WILMINGTON, Del. (Oct. 6, 2025) — Energy policy took center stage early Monday as Dave Stevenson, director of the Caesar Rodney Institute’s Energy Policy Center, joined A Better Delaware Chair M. Jane Brady for the latest installment of a weekly public webcast, “A Better Discussion.” At the 8 a.m. session, Stevenson urged Delaware lawmakers to embrace small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and roll back state carbon-pricing mandates, which he says have driven up electricity costs and risked grid reliability heading into winter.

But while Stevenson and Brady see nuclear energy as part of Delaware’s long-term solution, Governor Matt Meyer and environmental advocates are taking a more cautious — or opposing — stance.

In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.

“Delaware families and businesses are facing rising energy costs,” Meyer said. “We owe it to them to explore every possible solution to provide reliable, affordable, and clean energy.”

He added that nuclear deserves review, but not without scrutiny.

“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts before any decisions are made.”

Not all advocates agree the study is worthwhile. In its 2025 Legislative Recap, published in July, the Delaware Chapter of the Sierra Club reaffirmed its opposition to nuclear power as part of the state’s future energy mix.

The group instead urged lawmakers to:

Prioritize renewables such as solar and wind paired with battery storage;

Invest in energy efficiency and demand reduction, the most cost-effective strategies;

Avoid “costly, slow, and risky” nuclear projects that could leave waste and safety burdens; and

Focus on regional grid improvements and renewable integration rather than new nuclear feasibility studies.

The Sierra Club summarized its position by saying that while Governor Meyer believes nuclear “deserves careful study,” the organization sees it as “a distraction from cleaner, faster, and safer solutions.”

Stevenson’s Case for Nuclear

Stevenson said Delaware’s decarbonization mandates — not PJM’s market design — are “the root of reliability and cost problems.” He warned that “we could be looking at a blackout this winter” and claimed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) adds “about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal and 1 cent for natural gas,” making local generation uncompetitive.

He said Delaware now imports roughly 60 percent of its electricity.

Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source. Stevenson said three units could supply Delaware’s entire power needs — “two at the Indian River site and one at Edgemoor.”

“These modern reactors are smaller, safer, and can operate with almost no evacuation zone beyond the plant fence line,” Stevenson said.

Cost, Jobs, and Timeline

Stevenson compared energy costs at about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour for natural gas, 8 cents and falling for nuclear, and 18 to 20 cents for offshore wind, noting that offshore wind “runs a little over a third of the time” and has a lifespan of about 20 years compared with 80 for nuclear.

He said federal tax incentives and grants could make Delaware an early mover.

“With acreage and transmission already at Indian River, you could colocate a data center and use the power on-site,” he said.

Citing University of Tennessee research on a similar project near Oak Ridge, Stevenson said Delaware could generate $3.5 billion in economic impact and 1,800 direct jobs by constructing three SMRs.

Recycling Nuclear Fuel

Stevenson also discussed advances in reprocessing, saying that 95 percent of spent nuclear fuel can now be recycled, turning a waste challenge into a potential $40 billion-per-year national industry.

He said draft federal legislation could allow states to bid for temporary storage and recycling facilities, potentially creating high-wage jobs tied to the next generation of nuclear technology.

Policy Path Forward

Both Brady and Stevenson agreed Delaware should avoid repeating past decisions to close plants before replacements were ready.

“If we act quickly, we could become a net exporter of energy,” Brady said. “Stable, low-cost power could attract businesses and data centers to Delaware.”

Stevenson added that combining SMRs with ending the state’s carbon tax “would restore reliability, lower rates, and position Delaware for growth.”

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who’ve lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he’s enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that’s set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://www.informnny.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2025/10/68eb94eabca6a2.18824617.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-12 14:02:07.914930

The Trump administration has been terrible for climate protection. We can stop some of what the administration is trying to do, and we can slow down some more. Our most powerful tool right now is suing the Trump administration. Federal judges decide “against Trump in about 95% of cases,” according to University of Chicago Law professor Aziz Huq.

The administration’s legal losses have created a wave of headlines: “Trump expresses frustration as judge temporarily blocks troop mobilization to Portland.” “Appeals court blocks Trump from removing Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve board.” “Judges appointed by Trump keep ruling against him”

You might worry the Supreme Court will reverse those Trump-administration losses. It happens, but the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration about 20% of the time. You may have seen headlines like these: “Supreme Court Rejects, for Now, Trump’s Bid to Fire Government Watchdog.” “Amy Coney Barrett, John Roberts Deliver Trump Brutal Loss in NY Appeal.” “Divided Supreme Court rejects Trump bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.”

Even when the Supreme Court does decide in Trump’s favor, along the way, the cases slow down the administration. The delays have led to their own wave of headlines: “Recent court rulings are holding up some of Trump’s highest-profile moves.” “Judges are pausing Trump’s policy changes.” “White House officials bristle as the courts throttle parts of Trump’s agenda.”

Legal suits against the Trump administration are now some of the most powerful tools we have, not just for climate protection, but also for protecting democracy. A bunch of websites now provide lists of who is suing the Trump administration and about what. A review of the suits shows some patterns:

Many of the suits are being brought by state attorneys general. Here in Washington state, Attorney General Nick Brown has led or been part of 40 suits suing the Trump administration. Some cities and counties have joined in, including San Diego; Columbus, Ohio; Madison, Wisconsin; King County; Multnomah County in Oregon, and Oakland County in California.

Many cases against the Trump administration have been brought by unions. If you work where you could be represented by a union, but you haven’t yet joined, now’s the time. This is not just to have representation when negotiating employment contracts. This is also to support our unions as they protect our democracy.

The other organizations that most need your support are nonprofits. Your support can buy more legal help, and the more legal help we have on our side, the better the outcomes.

Here are three nonprofits who deserve support for their defense of the climate: the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and EarthJustice.

Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)

The NRDC has been litigating to protect American natural resources for decades. NRDC reports they sued the first Trump Administration 163 times, winning 90% of their cases. This year, they are suing to:

Stop the Department of Energy from forcing aged gas and coal power plants to continue burning fossil fuels past the shutdown dates that were planned by engineers.

Protect fuel efficiency for gasoline vehicles.

Require the Trump administration comply with congressional budgeting for EV Charging stations (NRDC is partnering on this with the Sierra Club).

Sierra Club

In addition to advocating for our global climate and our environment, the Sierra Club organizes member hiking, biking, skiing, and birding outings. If you love getting into some of the wonderful parks in Washington State, you’ll appreciate meeting folks in the Sierra Club. Locally, the Sno-Isle Sierra Club is partnering with Kicking Gas to make heat pumps affordable for families who want to stop their global warming pollution. Nationally, the Sierra Club is suing the Trump Administration to get them to:

Live up to their legally required financing of new public electric vehicle charging stations

Rehire illegally fired employees for National Parks and National Forests.

Stop the ecological devastation of new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

EarthJustice

With their slogan, “Because the earth needs a good lawyer,” EarthJustice has been suing the government to protect the environment and protect our global climate for 60 years. This year, they are suing the Trump administration to:

Stop illegal defunding of clean energy projects.

Restore the IRA program to help Americans save money on vehicles and appliances that do not create global warming pollution.

Return climate information that farmers depend on to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website.

There are many other organizations that are suing the Trump administration. If I have missed one that you feel is doing particularly good work, let folks know about it in the comments.

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is seeking bids for 500 million units of renewable energy annually to power its operations, aiming to increase clean energy reliance.

In a move aimed at increasing its reliance on clean energy, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has invited bids for the supply of 500 million units of renewable energy annually to power its operations, officials said on Sunday.

According to a statement, the DMRC is seeking to select a 'solar power developer' to set up a grid-connected captive generating plant along with a battery energy storage system (BESS) anywhere in India.

The energy produced will be supplied to the DMRC under a 25-year power purchase agreement, with the project expected to be completed within 15 months of award, it said.

At present, Delhi Metro meets about 33 per cent of its power demand from renewable sources. It procures around 350 MU annually from the Rewa Solar Park in Madhya Pradesh and generates 40 MU from rooftop solar installations across its stations, depots, and residential complexes, the statement said.

During daytime operations, the share of renewable energy reaches nearly 65 per cent, it added.

Live Events

With the new initiative, the DMRC said it aims to increase the share of renewable energy in its total power mix to over 60 per cent, including energy requirements for its upcoming Phase-IV network.

""If achieved, it will become the first Metro system in the country to source more than half of its total energy from clean sources,"" the statement said.

The move is part of DMRC's broader efforts to support India's transition to sustainable and low-carbon urban transport systems and comply with the government's 'Panchamrit' climate action goals announced at COP26.

The Public Utilities Commission last week directed its staff to consider proposals for new energy resources sought by Connecticut.

Any developments will have to be vetted by the commission for their benefits to Maine electric customers.

Connecticut put out a request for proposals last month seeking “late stage” projects that could capture federal tax breaks that may make them more cost-competitive for electric ratepayers.

James Fowler, spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said New England states share an electricity grid and working together on procurements potentially benefits regional ratepayers, enhanced grid reliability and affordability. Each state will perform its own evaluation and make its own decisions on whether to select projects, Fowler added.

“But by sharing information and pooling our demand, we hope to find opportunities to improve project viability and efficiency, such as by enabling purchases at larger scales, and capture the greatest benefits and value for ratepayers,” Fowler added.

In a statement, acting commissioner of the Maine Department of Energy Resources Dan Burgess said the state has often sought opportunities to coordinate with neighboring states on energy initiatives including energy procurement.

“By participating in Connecticut’s latest procurement effort, the state can consider its options to deliver more cost-effective clean power within federal tax credit timelines,” Burgess said.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act curtailed 30% of federal tax credits available to solar and wind developments. Projects now have to start construction by July 2026 or enter service by the end of 2027 and meet other requirements to qualify.

Maine launched its own expedited energy procurement this summer and last month selected five developments for contracts that could provide more than 250 megawatts of electricity.

Over the last fifty years, energy companies have tapped into geothermal sources using machinery to access harder-to-reach reserves.
Geothermal energy contributes just 0.4 percent of the U.S. energy mix, largely due to technological and geographical constraints to accessing geothermal reservoirs.
The firm’s CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli, said, “Geothermal power is one of several renewable energy sources expanding globally and proving to be a vital contributor to advancing sustainable energy development.
Investments in innovative geothermal extraction technologies show great promise for the commercial rollout of new operations across the country.","One of the few renewable energy sources that the Trump administration has not yet criticised is geothermal power, as companies across the United States continue to develop innovative geothermal projects with financial support from Biden-era policies. The sweeping budget legislation that President Trump signed in July preserved most key tax credits for geothermal power. Bipartisan support has encouraged several energy companies and startups to invest heavily in research and development into advanced geothermal operations in recent years, with promising results, giving hope for future clean energy production.

People have been tapping into geothermal energy from natural heat sources worldwide for centuries. Over the last fifty years, energy companies have tapped into geothermal sources using machinery to access harder-to-reach reserves. To achieve this, companies drill a borehole up to several kilometres deep, where the rocks are around 200°C, and inject water and sand at high pressure. This creates fractures in the rocks, which increases their permeability and produces a reservoir of hot water that can be extracted via a second borehole for the water to be used to generate electricity.

Geothermal energy contributes just 0.4 percent of the U.S. energy mix, largely due to technological and geographical constraints to accessing geothermal reservoirs. Existing plants depend on naturally occurring reservoirs of hot water and steam, in regions such as Northern California and Nevada, to power turbines and generate power. However, companies are now exploring new ways to access geothermal resources using techniques developed for oil fracking and innovative new methods to reach harder-to-access reservoirs in unconventional regions.

Sage Geothermal is now using heat and pressure to generate more power than conventional extraction methods through its cycle-based heat recovery approach. The company’s CEO, Cindy Taff, told Forbes, “By using the natural elasticity of the rock, we can bring hot water to the surface without pumps. Unlike traditional approaches, we maintain pressure in the system rather than venting it at the surface, and we hold open fractures with pressure instead of adding bridging materials like sand or proppant. These innovations reduce friction and energy losses, boosting net power output by 25 to 50 percent compared to other next-generation geothermal technologies.”

In August, Sage announced it was partnering with the international geothermal energy developer Ormat Technologies to roll out its next-generation technology at an Ormat facility in either Nevada or Utah. This is expected to help Sage speed up the development of its first commercial power-generation facility by around two years. Taff said, “For us, the ability to scale faster with Ormat is huge… But it’s also a great opportunity for Ormat to reach a deeper [geothermal] resource than what they’re targeting now.”

In September, Sage signed an agreement with the geothermal startup Fervo Energy to advance their geothermal activities. The two companies have both invested heavily in research and development into alternative geothermal extraction methods and could work together to advance this work. Fervo recently signed a deal with tech giant Google to provide it with clean power, while Sage has completed an agreement with Meta.

Houston-headquartered Fervo Energy was approved to deploy 2 GW of geothermal power in Beaver County, Utah, by the Department of the Interior last year, with its facility set to begin generating power in 2026. The company uses an Enhanced Geothermal Systems (ESG) proprietary technology to drill horizontally into geothermal reservoirs, allowing it to access multiple wells from a single location and showing promise for greater unconventional geothermal energy generation.

In September, the energy technology company Baker Hughes was contracted by Fervo Energy to supply equipment for five of its power plants in the Cape Station project in Utah. The plants are expected to produce 300 MW of electricity once fully operational, enough to power about 180,000 homes. Baker Hughes will supply engineering and manufacturing equipment as well as turboexpanders and the BRUSH Power Generation generator.

The firm’s CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli, said, “Geothermal power is one of several renewable energy sources expanding globally and proving to be a vital contributor to advancing sustainable energy development. “By working with a leader like Fervo Energy and leveraging our comprehensive portfolio of technology solutions, we are supporting the scaling of lower-carbon power solutions that are integral to meet growing global energy demand.”

In September, Bill Gates visited Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project alongside Senator John Curtis. He described the company’s horizontal drilling method as a “truly innovative approach” and discussed the role companies like Fervo will play in maintaining America’s energy independence. The founder of tech giant Microsoft said, “Geothermal is one of the most promising ways to deliver clean energy that’s reliable and affordable.”

As the outlook for renewable energy in the United States becomes more uncertain, following the Trump administration's attacks on solar and wind power, the geothermal energy sector appears to have maintained the backing of the government as several companies continue to expand operations. Investments in innovative geothermal extraction technologies show great promise for the commercial rollout of new operations across the country.

Charging stations, both public and private, have been installed at strategic City locations, including Thrive and the Lewisville City Hall, rendering the infrastructure more accessible for residents, businesses, and nonprofits interested in adopting EV technologies. To expand this network, Lewisville is eyeing a grant from the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), which is doling out $15 million to install 100 EV charging ports in public spaces in the region. In an effort to cater to the needs of the community, an interactive website has been launched by the Texas Department of Transportation, on which residents can suggest new locations for potential charging stations. This crowdsourced data will help to inform NCTCOG's broader installation strategy.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/10/lewisville-earns-bronze-designation-from-charging-smart-for-expansion-of-ev-infrastructure-3.webp,N,,2025-10-12 13:02:32.432590

The Public Utilities Commission last week directed its staff to consider proposals for new energy resources sought by Connecticut.

Any developments will have to be vetted by the commission for their benefits to Maine electric customers.

Connecticut put out a request for proposals last month seeking ""late stage"" projects that could capture federal tax breaks that may make them more cost-competitive for electric ratepayers.

James Fowler, spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said New England states share an electricity grid and working together on procurements potentially benefits regional ratepayers, enhanced grid reliability and affordability. Each state will perform its own evaluation and make its own decisions on whether to select projects, Fowler added.

""But by sharing information and pooling our demand, we hope to find opportunities to improve project viability and efficiency, such as by enabling purchases at larger scales, and capture the greatest benefits and value for ratepayers,"" Fowler added.

In a statement, acting commissioner of the Maine Department of Energy Resources Dan Burgess said the state has often sought opportunities to coordinate with neighboring states on energy initiatives including energy procurement.

""By participating in Connecticut's latest procurement effort, the state can consider its options to deliver more cost-effective clean power within federal tax credit timelines,"" Burgess said.

President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act curtailed 30% of federal tax credits available to solar and wind developments. Projects now have to start construction by July 2026 or enter service by the end of 2027 and meet other requirements to qualify.

This proposed facility was set to provide 6.2 gigawatts of clean energy from a vast area in the Nevada desert. However, it has disappeared from the Bureau of Land Management’s list of active projects, illustrating a shift away from renewable energy developments.

Esmeralda 7 Overview

Esmeralda 7 was intended to cover a land area comparable to Las Vegas. Once operational, it could have powered millions of homes while stabilizing energy costs for Nevada. The project was backed by industry giants such as NextEra, Invenergy, and Arevia, which were ready to invest billions of dollars.

Policy Changes and Their Implications

The cancellation resulted from changes made by the Interior Department under Secretary Doug Burgum. A new set of rules was introduced that complicates the approval process for renewable projects. As a result, large-scale developments like Esmeralda 7 face increased regulatory burdens, fragmented reviews, and heightened scrutiny.

Withdrawal of Programmatic Review: The review process that allowed for streamlined permits was rescinded.

Increased Barriers: New strategies limit acreage for solar developments and raise leasing costs.

Impact on Project Economics: Each subproject now requires separate environmental studies, undermining economic viability.

Consequences for Nevada

NV Energy forecasts a dramatic rise in electricity consumption due to data centers, expecting a 373% increase by 2030. Instead of relying on affordable clean energy from Esmeralda 7, the state will likely resort to gas-fired generation and higher electricity bills.

The Larger Context of Energy Production

While the U.S. turns away from large clean energy projects, countries like China and India are rapidly increasing their renewable capacities. This shift creates a competitive disadvantage for American industries that depend on affordable energy. The global emphasis is on reducing costs and promoting efficiency while the U.S. revisits outdated growth models.

International Success Models: Projects in Egypt, India, and Australia demonstrate the effectiveness of coordinated renewable development.

Cost Comparisons: Utility-scale solar averages $30 to $45 per MWh, making it highly competitive against fossil fuels.

The Future of Energy in America

The cancellation of Esmeralda 7 reflects a broader trend towards regulatory obstacles that threaten energy affordability. As the U.S. government complicates the deployment of renewable energy, the nation may find itself lagging in the global energy race. Investing in clean energy is not just an environmental imperative; it is also a crucial economic strategy.

But the 2026 Model 3 Standard may signal something simpler—and perhaps more consequential. It’s Tesla getting back to basics.

The new Model 3 isn’t flashy. It doesn’t tout record-breaking speed or breakthrough battery chemistry. Instead, it refines what already worked: a sedan that looks sleek, drives clean, and now, quietly undercuts much of the electric competition on price. With modest design updates, an improved ride, and an estimated range north of 320 miles (514.99 km), this version appears built less to dazzle than to dominate.

Tesla has trimmed weight, streamlined components, and recalibrated its pricing in an electric vehicle market that’s cooling from the highs of 2021. According to data from Cox Automotive, EV inventory in the U.S. reached an all-time high this summer, while average EV prices dropped nearly 20% from a year prior. In that landscape, the Model 3 Standard’s quiet arrival feels almost subversive.

There’s no viral unveiling or theatrical reveal. Just a tighter build, a quieter cabin, and fewer dollars on the sticker. It may not be the most exciting Tesla release—but it could be the most important one in years.

Design Language Grows Up, Subtly

The visual changes are subtle enough to miss at a glance, but side by side with the outgoing model, the new Model 3 is unmistakably sharper. Headlights are narrower. The front fascia is cleaner. The hoodline, marginally lowered, adds a more assertive stance. Tesla claims improved aerodynamics, and while the drag coefficient is only slightly reduced, the cumulative effect is noticeable in real-world driving—less wind noise, better efficiency.

Inside, the theme is restraint. Physical buttons are gone entirely, replaced by capacitive controls and voice activation. A single touchscreen remains the command center for everything from navigation to climate. While some drivers may miss tactile inputs, Tesla’s user interface has matured significantly, and software updates have made features like lane keeping and adaptive cruise smoother and more intuitive than earlier iterations.

The result isn’t a revolution. It’s refinement. This is a car that feels familiar—but finished.

Performance That Prioritizes Polish Over Power

In a lineup known for zero-to-sixty bravado, the Standard’s single-motor, rear-wheel-drive configuration is refreshingly grounded. Acceleration is brisk but not blistering—Tesla hasn’t released final specs, but independent testing from AutoGuide pegs the sprint to 60 mph (96.56 km/h) around 5.8 seconds, squarely in the range of a BMW 3 Series or Audi A4.

What stands out more is the chassis. The new Model 3 rides smoother than before, with revised suspension tuning that soaks up road imperfections without feeling detached. Steering remains light but responsive, and regenerative braking has been refined for more predictable pedal feel.

Tesla has also expanded driver control over performance settings. Drivers can now tweak regenerative braking intensity, cooling modes, and even traction bias, giving more customization than previous Standard trims. These are small additions, but they signal Tesla’s intent to treat even its base models with engineering care.

Range Estimates That Meet Real-World Expectations

Tesla claims an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, placing the Standard version well above the median for similarly priced EVs. Unlike many competitors, Tesla’s range estimates tend to hold up under real-world driving conditions—a result of optimized software, efficient motors, and aerodynamic design.

Battery size remains slightly below that of the Long Range or Performance models, but advances in energy density and drivetrain management help close the gap. The company has also improved thermal management systems to maintain range stability across climates—a common pain point for EV drivers in colder regions from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Charging remains a strong suit. Tesla’s Supercharger network, now opening to non-Tesla vehicles in several states, still offers the fastest and most widespread fast-charging experience in North America. The Model 3 Standard supports up to 170 kW DC fast charging, allowing an 80% top-up in just over 25 minutes under optimal conditions.

The Affordability Pivot Is No Accident

The most attention-grabbing change is the one on the invoice. The 2026 Model 3 Standard now starts below $38,000 before federal incentives, making it eligible for up to $7,500 in EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act—assuming final battery sourcing meets eligibility rules source. That could bring the effective price below $31,000, rivaling many gas-powered sedans.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-Model-3-Standard-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:01:25.058642

This approach addresses the underlying structural weaknesses in critical mineral supply chains rather than merely creating temporary buffers against disruption.
Developing robust domestic supply chains for critical minerals typically requires 7-10 years from initial investment to full-scale production.","What Are Critical Minerals and Why Is the Pentagon Stockpiling Them?

Critical minerals represent essential non-fuel materials with high supply disruption risk that serve as the building blocks for modern defense technologies, renewable energy systems, and advanced manufacturing. The Pentagon has launched an unprecedented $1 billion procurement initiative to secure these resources amid growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and national security risks.

These minerals—including rare earth elements, battery metals, and specialized alloys—form the foundation of modern military equipment, from precision-guided weapons to communications systems. Without secure access to these resources, America's defense capabilities and technological edge could be seriously compromised.

The U.S. Geological Survey currently identifies 50 mineral commodities as critical minerals energy security based on their economic and national security importance coupled with supply chain vulnerability. This designation follows strict criteria established under the Energy Act of 2020, evaluating factors like importance to key sectors and potential for supply disruptions.

Key Characteristics of Strategic Defense Critical Minerals

High importance to national security: Essential components in weapons systems, communications equipment, and military vehicles

Significant supply chain vulnerabilities: Often concentrated in geopolitically sensitive regions

Limited domestic production: Many critical minerals have minimal or non-existent U.S. production capacity

Foreign processing domination: While raw materials may exist globally, processing capacity is often concentrated in specific countries

Irreplaceability: Many critical minerals have unique properties that cannot be easily substituted

Defense applications for these minerals are extensive and growing. For example, each Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bomb requires approximately 0.5-1 kg of rare earth materials, while a single F-35 fighter jet contains approximately 920 pounds of rare earth elements across various systems.

How Is the Pentagon Addressing Critical Mineral Supply Vulnerabilities?

The Strategic Procurement Initiative

The Department of Defense has allocated significant resources toward purchasing and stockpiling critical minerals—representing the largest such investment in decades. This strategic buying initiative marks a fundamental shift in defense resource management, moving from just-in-time acquisition toward building resilient strategic reserves.

The initiative encompasses multiple approaches:

Direct purchases of processed critical minerals from domestic and allied sources

Strategic investments in revitalizing domestic mining and processing capacity

Long-term off-take agreements with U.S. producers to guarantee markets

Development of alternative supply chains through international partnerships

The Defense Production Act Title III program, which provides the Pentagon authority to strengthen domestic industrial base capabilities, has allocated over $500 million for critical materials initiatives since 2020 alone, according to the Department of Defense Office of Industrial Policy.

Strategic Investments in Domestic Production

Rather than simply purchasing minerals on the open market, the Pentagon has made targeted investments to rebuild domestic supply chains. Notable examples include:

Investment Type Recipient Purpose Defense Production Act Funding MP Materials Support rare earth mining and processing capacity Defense Production Act Funding USA Rare Earth Develop separation technology for heavy rare earths Contract Award Lynas USA Build commercial heavy rare earth separation facility

In March 2022, the Department of Defense announced a $35 million Defense Production Act investment to support MP Materials in developing rare earth processing capabilities at its Mountain Pass facility in California. This represents part of a broader strategy to reestablish domestic processing capabilities that have significantly declined over past decades.

Which Critical Minerals Are Prioritized for the National Defense Stockpile?

High-Priority Rare Earth Elements

Rare earth elements top the Pentagon's priority list due to their irreplaceable role in defense technologies and the near-complete dominance of processing by foreign entities.

Key rare earth targets include:

Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr) Oxide: Essential for powerful permanent magnets used in precision weapons, electric vehicle motors, and wind turbines. These magnets can achieve magnetic field strengths of 1.3-1.5 Tesla, enabling significant miniaturization of motors and actuators in guided missile systems.

Dysprosium: Critical for enhancing coercivity of NdFeB magnets at high operating temperatures (exceeding 200°C), making it essential for military systems operating in extreme environments.

Samarium: Used in specialized samarium-cobalt magnets for missile guidance systems. These magnets are preferred for precision-guided munitions due to their superior temperature stability, with operating ranges from -40°C to 350°C.

Terbium: Essential for sonar systems, fuel cells, and various electronic warfare applications.

Battery Metals and Other Critical Materials

Beyond rare earths, the stockpiling initiative targets several other critical materials:

Cobalt: Essential for high-performance batteries and aerospace alloys. The Defense Logistics Agency's 2024 assessment identifies cobalt as a ""Tier 1"" critical material.

Manganese: Critical for steel production and battery cathodes, with limited domestic production capacity.

Lithium: Fundamental to advanced battery systems for portable military equipment and increasingly for electrified tactical vehicles.

Graphite: Required for battery anodes and various defense applications, with no domestic production currently at commercial scale.

Gallium: Used in radar systems, advanced electronics, and semiconductor applications critical for defense technologies.

What Challenges Does the U.S. Face in Securing Critical Mineral Supplies?

Foreign Dependency Concerns

The United States currently depends heavily on imports for many critical minerals, with China controlling processing for approximately 80-90% of rare earths globally. This dependency creates significant national security vulnerabilities, especially as geopolitical tensions rise.

According to U.S. Geological Survey data, the United States is 100% import-reliant for 12 critical minerals and more than 50% import-reliant for an additional 31 minerals. This heavy dependence on foreign sources—many concentrated in regions of geopolitical concern—creates strategic vulnerabilities for the defense industrial base.

Limited Domestic Processing Capacity

While the U.S. possesses significant mineral reserves, decades of underinvestment have left domestic processing capabilities severely limited. Rebuilding this infrastructure requires substantial capital investment and time.

Key challenges include:

New processing facilities typically require 7-10 years to develop fully from initial planning to commercial operation

Environmental permitting creates additional hurdles, with U.S. processes taking 2-3 times longer than in competing countries

Technical expertise has diminished with offshoring of processing capacity

Initial capital requirements of $150-300 million for commercially viable rare earth separation facilities

Market Concentration and Price Volatility

Critical mineral markets are often characterized by:

High concentration of production in a few countries, limiting competition

Susceptibility to market manipulation by dominant producers

Extreme price volatility that discourages private investment

Limited transparency in pricing and contracts

Price volatility poses a particular challenge to investment stability. For example, NdPr oxide prices have fluctuated dramatically—from $40/kg in 2019 to $165/kg in 2022, then back down to $62/kg in 2024—representing 400% variation within just five years. This volatility makes long-term planning exceedingly difficult without government support.

How Does the National Defense Stockpile Currently Operate?

Current Stockpile Status and Limitations

The National Defense Stockpile was established during the Cold War but has been significantly depleted over decades. Current reserves are insufficient for modern defense needs.

Key stockpile metrics:

Present stockpile value: Approximately $888.9 million as of September 30, 2023

Authorized holding capacity: $3.4 billion worth of critical materials

Coverage: Only weeks to months of critical materials for defense needs

Focus: Emergency defense requirements, not broader industrial resilience

Management: Defense Logistics Agency's Strategic Materials office

The current stockpile contains 42 different materials deemed critical for defense applications, with primary holdings including cobalt, beryllium, chromium, manganese, and various rare earth compounds. However, this represents a small fraction of the stockpile's historical peak.

At its Cold War peak in 1954, the National Defense Stockpile held the equivalent of $43.2 billion (inflation-adjusted to 2023 dollars) in strategic materials. Systematic disposal programs reduced holdings by over 90% between 1990-2020, leaving the current pentagon critical minerals stockpile at historically low levels relative to defense needs.

Modernization Efforts

The current stockpiling initiative represents a fundamental reimagining of the stockpile's purpose and scope:

Expanding beyond traditional war reserve materials to support technological innovation

Incorporating a broader range of technologies and applications, especially electronics and energy storage

Supporting domestic production capacity rather than just warehousing materials

Developing more sophisticated management approaches that account for technological change

The National Defense Stockpile operates under a multi-stage requirement determination process:

Needs analysis conducted by the Defense Logistics Agency every three years

Requirements calculation based on a three-year wartime scenario

Acquisition planning authorized by the annual National Defense Authorization Act

Market approach using competitive bidding when possible and negotiated contracts for specialized materials

What Legislative Support Exists for Critical Mineral Security?

Recent Legislative Actions

Several recent legislative initiatives have strengthened the legal framework for critical mineral security:

Defense Production Act: Provides authority for investments in critical mineral production capacity, with expanded use since 2020

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021): Allocated $140 million for critical minerals mapping, data collection, and research through USGS programs

CHIPS and Science Act (2022): Includes $500 million for critical minerals research and processing technology development through the Department of Energy

Inflation Reduction Act (2022): Establishes domestic content requirements for critical minerals in electric vehicle batteries to qualify for tax credits: 40% (2023), increasing to 80% by 2027

Annual Defense Authorization Acts: Regularly include provisions for critical mineral security

These legislative actions reflect growing bipartisan consensus on the importance of addressing critical mineral supply vulnerabilities.

Evolving Policy Framework

The U.S. government has developed increasingly sophisticated approaches to critical mineral security:

Creation of more targeted ""strategic defense critical minerals"" lists that prioritize the most vulnerable materials

Improved interagency coordination on mineral security issues through formal working groups

Development of whole-of-government approaches to supply chain resilience

International partnerships with allied nations to diversify supply sources

Integration of critical minerals into broader industrial policy frameworks

Congressional appropriations for Defense Production Act Title III critical minerals funding have increased from approximately $25 million in FY2019 to $250 million in FY2024, representing a ten-fold increase in just five years. This dramatic funding growth reflects the escalating priority placed on mineral security issues.

How Are Public-Private Partnerships Advancing Mineral Security?

Case Study: Domestic Processing Partnerships

The Pentagon's partnerships with domestic producers exemplify the new approach to critical mineral security. For example:

Initial Investment: The Department of Defense announced a $35 million Defense Production Act investment in MP Materials in March 2022

Private Sector Commitment: MP Materials committed to investing in expansion of domestic rare earth processing capacity at its Mountain Pass facility

Supply Chain Development: Creation of a vertically integrated supply chain from mining through magnet manufacturing

Technology Development: Joint research into processing improvements and efficiency gains

Workforce Development: Training programs for specialized skills in mineral processing

Similarly, in May 2021, the Department of Defense awarded Lynas USA $30.4 million to build a commercial heavy rare earth separation facility in Texas, focused on processing dysprosium and terbium for defense applications.

Broader Industry Engagement

Beyond individual partnerships, the Pentagon is engaging with industry through:

Industry consortia for technology development and standard-setting

Supply chain mapping exercises to identify vulnerabilities

Standards development for critical materials to ensure compatibility

Information sharing on emerging risks and opportunities

Research and development partnerships through defense laboratories

These collaborative approaches represent a significant evolution from traditional defense procurement models, recognizing that addressing mineral security requires sustained cooperation between government and private industry.

What Role Do International Alliances Play in Critical Mineral Security?

Partnerships with Allied Nations

The U.S. is developing coordinated approaches with allies to reduce collective vulnerability:

Minerals Security Partnership (MSP): Launched in June 2022 at the G7 Summit with 11 member countries (United States, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, Sweden, United Kingdom, Norway) plus the European Union as an institutional partner

U.S.-Australia Critical Minerals Compact: Signed in October 2023 with a $140 million combined investment commitment in Australia's strategic reserve and battery minerals projects

U.S.-Canada Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals: Identifies 31 critical minerals of mutual interest with commitments to regulatory cooperation on permitting, joint R&D on processing technologies, and information sharing on supply security

Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group: Established in 2021 between US, Australia, India, and Japan with critical minerals security as a core focus

These international frameworks aim to create alternative supply chains that reduce collective dependence on potentially unreliable sources.

Diversification Strategies

These international partnerships pursue several key objectives:

Developing alternative supply sources outside regions of concern

Coordinating stockpiling efforts to prevent market disruption from government purchases

Sharing technology for more efficient extraction and processing

Establishing common standards and practices for responsible sourcing

Pooling research and development resources

The Minerals Security Partnership represents the most comprehensive international framework, bringing together major democratic economies to accelerate the development of diverse critical mineral supply chains through coordinated action and investment.

What Future Developments Are Expected in Critical Mineral Security?

Emerging Technologies and Approaches

The critical minerals landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with several emerging trends:

Urban Mining: Recovering critical minerals from electronic waste and industrial byproducts. According to the UN Global E-waste Monitor 2024, an estimated 62 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated globally in 2022, containing approximately 50,000 metric tons of rare earth elements, 320,000 metric tons of copper, and 16,000 metric tons of cobalt—with less than 20% currently recovered.

Deep Sea Mining: Exploring ocean floor resources, though with significant environmental concerns that require careful assessment and mitigation strategies.

Advanced Recycling: Developing more efficient processes for recovering minerals from end-of-life products. The U.S. Department of Energy's Critical Materials Institute projects that advanced recycling technologies could supply 30-40% of U.S. rare earth demand by 2035.

Material Substitution: Researching alternatives to reduce dependency on the most vulnerable minerals, including development of reduced-dysprosium magnet formulations.

Long-Term Strategic Planning

The Pentagon is developing more sophisticated approaches to long-term mineral security:

20-year strategic plans for critical mineral security that account for technological change

Integration of mineral security into broader defense industrial base planning

Development of early warning systems for emerging supply risks

Regular reassessment of critical mineral priorities as technologies evolve

Coordinated public-private investment strategies that balance security with economic efficiency

These forward-looking approaches reflect growing recognition that mineral security requires sustained, multi-decade commitment rather than short-term fixes.

How Can the U.S. Achieve Greater Critical Mineral Independence?

Multi-Faceted Approach

Achieving greater independence requires a coordinated strategy across multiple domains:

Domestic Production: Revitalizing mining and processing within the U.S., focusing on highest-priority materials

Recycling and Recovery: Developing circular economy approaches to recover materials from waste streams

Substitution Research: Finding alternatives to the most vulnerable materials through materials science

Stockpiling: Maintaining strategic reserves for emergency needs and market stabilization

International Partnerships: Coordinating with allies on shared challenges and complementary capabilities

This comprehensive approach recognizes that no single strategy can address all vulnerabilities, requiring parallel efforts across multiple domains.

Balancing Competing Priorities

Successful critical mineral security requires balancing multiple considerations:

Economic efficiency versus supply security in sourcing decisions

Environmental protection versus resource development in permitting processes

Short-term costs versus long-term resilience in investment decisions

Domestic production versus international partnerships in supply chain design

Commercial applications versus defense requirements in technology development

Finding the right balance between these competing priorities requires thoughtful policy coordination and private-public cooperation. Furthermore, Trump's critical minerals order and the ongoing development of a European CRM facility demonstrate how this has become a global concern requiring international solutions.

FAQ: Pentagon Critical Minerals Stockpile

What exactly is the National Defense Stockpile?

The National Defense Stockpile is a reserve of strategic and critical materials maintained by the U.S. government to prevent dangerous and costly dependence on foreign sources during national emergencies. Currently valued at approximately $888.9 million, it includes various metals, minerals, and materials deemed essential for defense applications. The stockpile is managed by the Defense Logistics Agency Strategic Materials office and operates under authorities established in the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act.

Why is the Pentagon investing in rare earth elements specifically?

Rare earth elements are irreplaceable in many advanced defense technologies, including precision-guided weapons, night vision equipment, and communications systems. Currently, China dominates global processing capacity for these materials at 85-90%, creating significant vulnerability for U.S. defense capabilities. Additionally, many rare earth applications require very specific properties that cannot be achieved with substitute materials, making them particularly critical for national security.

How does the current stockpiling initiative differ from previous approaches?

The current initiative represents a fundamental shift from passive warehousing to active supply chain development. Rather than simply purchasing and storing materials, the Pentagon is investing in domestic production capacity, developing public-private partnerships, and creating guaranteed markets for U.S. producers. This approach addresses the underlying structural weaknesses in critical mineral supply chains rather than merely creating temporary buffers against disruption.

Will these investments affect consumer technology prices?

While the primary focus is national security, increased domestic production of critical minerals may eventually help stabilize prices for consumer technologies that use these same materials, including electric vehicles, smartphones, and renewable energy systems. However, the immediate impact on consumer prices is likely to be minimal. Over the longer term, more diverse and resilient supply chains should reduce price volatility, potentially benefiting both defense and civilian applications.

How long will it take to develop domestic alternatives to foreign supplies?

Developing robust domestic supply chains for critical minerals typically requires 7-10 years from initial investment to full-scale production. The Pentagon's current investments represent early steps in what will necessarily be a long-term process of rebuilding domestic capabilities. Environmental permitting, technology development, facility construction, and workforce training all require significant time. While initial results may be seen within 3-5 years for some materials, comprehensive supply chain resilience is a decade-long endeavor.

The company has begun telling tired drivers to switch on its Full Self-Driving system. Safety researchers say this move might backfire and have severe consequences, Wired reported.

What's happening?

Tesla's dashboard prompts drivers to consider activating FSD, the brand's most advanced driver-assist package, if they feel drowsy. However, the feature is still considered experimental and requires constant human oversight.

That's where the concern comes in. For so long, the feature held a disclaimer that the driver must be able to take control at any given time. With the new in-car messaging in place, researchers worry that it could confuse tired drivers when they need to be focused on the road.

""The prompt seems highly contrary to research,"" Bryan Reimer, a driver assistance technology research scientist at MIT's AgeLab, pointed out to Wired.

Why is this important?

""As humans, as we get tired or we get fatigued, taking away more things that we need to do could actually backfire,"" Charlie Klauer, a driver and driving performance researcher at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, explained to Wired. He noted that implementing such a system could be tricky.

According to the National Sleep Foundation, 20% of driving accidents in 2023 were caused by drowsy driving. Suggesting tired drivers hand over more control could increase risks instead of reducing them.

The environmental angle also matters. Electric vehicles are supposed to help reduce heat-trapping pollution and save money on transportation. If drivers and regulators lose trust in EVs because of safety controversies, adoption could slow down.

Critics also argue that the alert could mislead users into believing FSD is closer to full autonomy than it really is.

Tesla has previously faced scrutiny for allegedly overstating its software's abilities, and its other features — like the force-touch turn signals in Model 3 and Model S vehicles — have sparked controversy in driving schools. Safety advocates worry this move undermines the company's claims of prioritizing driver responsibility.

What's being done about it?

Advocates are calling for clearer rules on semi-autonomous features, as highlighted in the Indiana Law Journal, and for tighter regulations, according to research published in Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives.

… And when we finish this out, there’ll never be any wealth like what we have.” The United States has “already solved inflation, we’ve solved prices,” Trump maintains as well.
At 17.4 percent, the Trump tariff rate is at its highest since 1935.
To evade tariffs, China has moved some manufacturing and assembly operations to other countries.
China is courting leaders around the world who have been stung by the Trump tariffs.","“I love tariffs,” President Trump has said. “My favorite word is ‘tariff.’”

Thanks to the tariffs he has imposed on about 90 countries, he claims, “we’re becoming rich as hell. … And when we finish this out, there’ll never be any wealth like what we have.” The United States has “already solved inflation, we’ve solved prices,” Trump maintains as well.

A substantial majority of Americans do not agree.

In a poll taken in August by the Pew Research Center, 61 percent of respondents did not approve of Trump’s tariff policies. And 55 percent indicated the levies will have a negative impact on them, their families and the country.

Americans have good reason to be concerned. Far from becoming “rich as hell,” the federal government is in a deep financial hole. This year, spending increased by $391 billion; the $1.9 trillion deficit is the third largest in U.S. history. The total national debt tops $37 trillion, a number which, following passage of the administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” is virtually certain to increase by trillions. Tariff revenues have not and cannot make more than a small dent in these deficits.

At 17.4 percent, the Trump tariff rate is at its highest since 1935. Tariffs are the principal reason inflation is higher now than it was when Trump began his second term in January. This year, tariffs will, on average, cost each household about $2,300. Price increases include a 10 percent levy on wood and lumber and 25 percent on kitchen cabinets, upholstered furniture and bathroom vanities, set to go into effect on Oct. 14. The added costs are likely to slow the construction of affordable residential housing, which is already out of reach for many buyers and renters.

The tariffs have upended supply chains. Apple has moved iPhone assembly plants from China to India. Stellantis N.V. paused production in North America because of price hikes in automotive components. To evade tariffs, China has moved some manufacturing and assembly operations to other countries.

Applied to friends as well as foes, at times without a discernible justification or, as with Brazil, out of personal or partisan animus, the tariffs have antagonized Canadians, Mexicans, Japanese, Australians and members of the European Union. China is courting leaders around the world who have been stung by the Trump tariffs.

Ironically, the tariff war has also undermined the domestic manufacturing and agrarian sectors of the economy Trump promised to protect and promote.

China’s zeroing out of its multibillion-dollar purchases of American soybeans, the largest agricultural product exported by the United States, caused prices to plummet to $9 per bushel. John Deere & Company attributes much of its projected 26 percent drop in net income to reduced spending by farmers on machinery and price increases in aluminum and steel. Trucking companies have suffered as well from the decline in agricultural exports.

“Farmers … are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit,” Trump has declared. And so, the administration, which distributed $23 billion to them during the trade wars in his first term, is now preparing a bailout in the neighborhood of $35-50 billion.

Already reeling from higher prices for fertilizers and equipment and the potentially permanent loss of markets, farmers are apoplectic about reports that the administration is working out details of a $20 billion aid package to Argentina, which comes on the heels of that country’s replacement of the United States as the major supplier of soybeans to China. Scarcely part of an America First agenda, what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent calls a “credit swap line,” appears to be a lifeline to Argentina’s embattled libertarian president, Javier Milei, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.

The CEOs of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis NV recently projected that tariffs will cost their companies $4.5 billion, $2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in revenues, and that production levels would not rebound until 2027. In an apparent attempt to placate them and prevent potential buyers of cars and trucks from sticker shock, the Trump administration is reportedly close to a deal that would spare vehicles assembled in the U.S. from tariffs.

This move was an about-face by a president who imposed an import tax on Mexican vehicles in July 2025 that exceeded the rate on all other countries except China, undermining the USMCA treaty he had signed with Mexico and Canada in 2020 and praised as “the largest fairest, most balanced and modern trade agreement ever achieved.”

Whether Trump has the authority to, in essence, take over tariff policy is in dispute. The Constitution grants Congress the power to impose tariffs. Legislation in the 20th century allowed the president to levy tariffs to address threats to national security and unfair trade practices, but the Supreme Court has indicated that this delegation of powers must include “intelligible principles” that limit the president’s actions.

The Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on tariffs in the coming months. Whatever the high court decides, however, it should be clear that using tariffs as a blunt instrument of global domination actually does substantial damage to America’s international reputation, national interests and economy, as well as to its manufacturers, retailers and consumers.

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a477104a-9966-40c9-b597-1af6563b709f/wirestory_a5c28123e10a0090896e59abf69c152c_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-12 08:59:42.937158

Researchers have now developed a cocatalyst that introduces single-atom copper sites into tungsten nitride, creating highly active centers that favor hydrogen generation over unwanted byproducts. When combined with a cadmium sulfide photocatalyst, the new system achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 172.69 μmol·h⁻¹ with selectivity approaching 95%. Detailed experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that copper single atoms enhance charge transfer, open electron pathways, and provide novel active sites for hydrogen evolution. This discovery demonstrates a powerful strategy for designing efficient and selective photocatalytic systems for renewable hydrogen production.

Hydrogen is considered a clean fuel for the future, but conventional production methods remain energy-intensive and carbon-emitting. Photoreforming of formic acid, a common biomass derivative and hydrogen carrier, provides a mild and renewable pathway for hydrogen generation. However, traditional semiconductor catalysts such as CdS suffer from low activity and poor selectivity due to competing side reactions, including carbon monoxide formation, which reduce hydrogen purity. Transition-metal nitrides have recently emerged as cocatalysts with improved performance, yet selectivity limitations persist. Based on these challenges, there is a critical need to develop advanced catalysts with engineered active sites to enhance both efficiency and selectivity in hydrogen photoreforming systems.

A research team from Xi’an Jiaotong University, University of South China, and collaborating institutes reported a development (DOI: 10.1002/cey2.70024) in Carbon Energy on June 4, 2025. The study presents a Cu–W₂N₃ cocatalyst containing atomically dispersed copper sites, which, when integrated with CdS, markedly enhances hydrogen production from the photoreforming of formic acid. The new system achieved higher activity and nearly 95% hydrogen selectivity, outperforming conventional cocatalysts. This work sheds light on how tailoring single-atom sites on cocatalyst surfaces can effectively direct reaction pathways toward clean hydrogen generation.

The team synthesized two-dimensional Cu–W₂N₃ nanosheets using a modified molten salt method, ensuring the copper species were atomically dispersed rather than aggregated into nanoparticles. Advanced microscopy and spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Cu single-atom sites with a +1 oxidation state embedded in the W₂N₃ lattice. These sites altered the electronic structure, creating Cu–N–W electron channels that facilitated rapid charge transfer from CdS to the cocatalyst. Performance tests showed that the CdS/Cu–W₂N₃ hybrid achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 172.69 μmol·h⁻¹ with selectivity up to 93.7–95%, significantly higher than bare CdS (45%) or CdS/W₂N₃ (83%). The system also demonstrated excellent stability across ten continuous cycles. Mechanistic studies revealed that copper single atoms suppress carbon monoxide evolution by reducing nitrogen vacancy sites while simultaneously providing efficient new active centers for hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory calculations further supported that Cu single atoms on the {001} facet are energetically favorable for hydrogen formation. Together, these findings confirm that rational design of single-atom cocatalysts is a powerful strategy to simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity in solar-driven hydrogen production.

“Our study shows that introducing single-atom copper sites into tungsten nitride fundamentally changes the selectivity of photocatalytic reactions,” said Prof. Xiangjiu Guan, corresponding author. “These atomically dispersed sites not only accelerate electron transfer but also suppress competing pathways that produce carbon monoxide. This dual function allows us to obtain hydrogen with very high purity under sunlight. The work highlights how careful engineering of cocatalyst surfaces at the atomic level can unlock new opportunities for efficient, sustainable hydrogen production from renewable resources.”

The development of Cu–W₂N₃ single-atom cocatalysts opens a new pathway toward practical solar-driven hydrogen production. By ensuring high selectivity and stability, the system addresses two major barriers to scaling photocatalytic hydrogen technologies. Beyond formic acid, the design principles could be applied to other biomass-derived fuels and liquid hydrogen carriers, offering a sustainable route for coupling carbon-neutral energy conversion with biomass utilization. The study also advances the broader field of single-atom catalysis, showing how atomic precision can control reaction outcomes. Ultimately, this approach paves the way for producing high-purity hydrogen as a clean fuel for transportation, storage, and chemical industries.

Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Tim Hodgson announced Monday the launch of the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund (CMIF) Indigenous Grants stream, which will provide up to $3 million in total funding. Individual grants can reach $150,000, with up to $200,000 available for initiatives led by or benefiting Indigenous organizations in northern or remote communities.

“The funding supports Indigenous engagement and participation in key critical minerals infrastructure projects, positioning Canada as a global leader in sustainably sourced minerals while creating good jobs and long-term growth for communities,” Hodgson said.

The CMIF Indigenous Grants stream was created to provide resources for Indigenous groups to actively participate in critical minerals development, including clean energy and transportation infrastructure projects. Proposals will be prioritized based on potential benefits to First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities, the significance of the associated development impacts, and geographic distribution across Canada.

Applications for this round must be submitted by Dec. 17, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Natural Resources Canada will host an information session on Oct. 21.

The initiative is part of Canada’s broader $1.5-billion Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund, which aims to close infrastructure gaps, connect resources to markets, and support the low-carbon transition. Indigenous involvement is central, particularly because many proposed projects are located on traditional territories and treaty lands.

Eligible activities under the grants must relate to projects that support increased critical minerals production, with initiatives scheduled to run from April 1, 2026, to March 31, 2028.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who’ve lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he’s enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that’s set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-899.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 11:00:53.771159

NuScale Power is looking to build smaller, modular nuclear reactors.

Unlike traditional site-built reactors, these reactors can be made in a factory.

NuScale is at the leading edge of a big change in nuclear power.

The ""big"" problem with nuclear power

Historically, nuclear power plants have been huge capital investment projects. Nuclear reactors have, so far, been site built, meaning that all of the construction basically takes place where the reactor is going to be located. The projects have also been massive, with nuclear power plants often meant to replace large coal or natural gas power plants.

It isn't uncommon for nuclear reactor projects to be delayed and over budget. For example, the most recent nuclear power plant built in the United States, by regulated utility The Southern Company, was seven years late and cost around $17 billion more than expected. Those are not good construction results, even though Southern will now have access to reliable nuclear power for decades into the future.

Given that backdrop, it is understandable that another company building the same style of nuclear power plant at roughly the same time simply gave up when its project manager, Westinghouse, went bankrupt. Southern, by contrast, took on the role of project manager from Westinghouse, which was also overseeing its reactors, so it could keep its power plant construction going.

Needless to say, the nuclear power industry isn't an easy industry in which to operate. And when things go wrong at a large, site-built nuclear power plant, they can go wrong in a massive way, noting the two meltdowns and one near miss highlighted above. That usually earns the entire industry a black eye despite a generally safe operating history for most nuclear power plants.

NuScale is changing the script by going ""small""

This is where NuScale Power comes in, given that it is building small scale modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). These reactors are built in a factory, creating a more uniform product that also benefits from the cost efficiencies offered by an assembly line manufacturing approach.

They are small, so they can be easily transported to where they are needed, located more closely to population centers, and adverse events are expected to be easier to contain. In addition, by including the most modern technology, the safety of NuScale's SMRs is expected to be higher than for older reactors.

To be fair, NuScale isn't the only company working on SMR technology. However, it was ""the first SMR to receive U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) design approval."" It is currently the only SMR approved by the NRC, which the company believes gives it a bit of a leg up on the competition. But there's another important piece to the puzzle.

NuScale Power is working with RoPower, a Romanian electricity company, as it makes its final go/no go decision on a new nuclear power plant. That plant could end up being powered by six SMRs provided by NuScale Power that will be linked together. NuScale has already ordered parts that have long construction times for the six SMRs this project would require. But it has those same parts on order for another six reactors as well. In other words, the company is ready to hit the ground running.

The company's stock has risen around 200% or so over the past year. Wall Street clearly isn't ignoring the stock. However, with a final decision from RoPower expected sometime in the next year, NuScale Power could quickly change from a good idea to a real business. Notably, the second SMR sale should be much easier to get than the first, since the ice will have been broken. So NuScale Power could turn into a growth story very quickly.

Watch NuScale, even if you don't buy it

Nuclear power and SMRs aren't things that people talk about every day. But SMRs are a potential game-changing technology in the energy sector, with NuScale Power one of the companies leading the way into the future.

If that is interesting to you, and you are a more aggressive investor, you might want to consider buying before the first sale is inked. But even if you aren't interested in buying NuScale, it's worth learning about the huge energy opportunity that SMRs offer the world.

The collaboration aims to support growth for American solar manufacturing and create domestic job opportunities.

T1 Energy’s latest move clearly struck a chord with investors, as the stock’s 7-day share price return surged over 43%. This built on massive momentum with a 94.7% climb in the last month. Momentum really took off this year, with the 1-year total shareholder return topping 250%, even as longer-term returns are still catching up from past declines.

If you find these shifts in the renewables space compelling, it’s a great moment to broaden your search and discover

But with shares riding a powerful wave of optimism, the key question for investors now is whether T1 Energy is still trading at a bargain or if the market has already factored in all its future potential.

Most Popular Narrative: 21% Overvalued

Despite ambitious expectations for rapid business expansion and strong tailwinds, the current market price of $3.64 sits noticeably above the $3.00 fair value suggested by the most widely tracked narrative. Here is the core fundamental argument behind that valuation outlook.

The expansion of U.S. electricity demand, driven by the AI infrastructure build-out, electrification of transportation, and onshoring of advanced manufacturing, positions T1 as a key provider of solar modules and storage solutions for a rapidly growing market, supporting sustained topline revenue growth. Robust government policy tailwinds, including stackable, transferable Section 45X tax credits and protectionist trade measures, are providing T1 with access to funding, margin-boosting incentives, and risk mitigation for its U.S. production pipeline. This should improve both earnings quality and net margins.

Earnings power, revenue takeoff, and government incentives all build a case for T1’s future valuation leap. Analysts are betting on exceptional growth prospects and big margin improvements, but only the full narrative breaks down the bold assumptions fueling this premium price tag.

Result: Fair Value of $3.00 (OVERVALUED)

However, if government incentives weaken or T1 Energy fails to secure project financing, the company’s impressive growth outlook could encounter significant short-term hurdles.

Another View: Market Ratios Send a Mixed Signal

Looking at the price-to-sales ratio, T1 Energy appears reasonably valued against its peers. It trades at 3x sales, well below the average peer multiple of 15.4x and the fair ratio of 36.7x. However, compared to the US Electrical industry’s average of 2.3x, it appears slightly more expensive. Does this gap mean hidden risks, or could the market re-rate the stock closer to those higher multiples?

Investors are considering what might be driving renewed interest in the company.

Over the past year, Alliance Resource Partners has experienced some ups and downs, but momentum appears to be picking up again, with a 10% 1-month share price return and a solid 9.6% total shareholder return over the past twelve months. While the past quarter was softer, long-term shareholders have still seen impressive gains as the company continues to grow earnings and ride shifts in broader market sentiment.

If renewed momentum in ARLP has piqued your interest, this could be the perfect moment to broaden your outlook and discover

With Alliance Resource Partners now trading at a noticeable discount to analyst price targets and showing solid long-term returns, the key question is whether shares are undervalued or if the market is already factoring in the company’s future growth potential.

Most Popular Narrative: 17.9% Undervalued

With the narrative’s fair value set at $30.5, Alliance Resource Partners’ last close at $25.05 represents a significant gap that could catch opportunistic investors’ attention. This pricing difference is rooted in expectations for sector tailwinds and future profit expansion, setting the stage for a closer look at the underlying trends.

Recent legislative and administrative shifts in U.S. energy policy, such as regulatory reprieves for coal plants, the phasing out of renewable tax credits in favor of baseload power, and direct financial incentives to keep fossil fuel plants operational, have created the most favorable regulatory environment for coal in decades. These tailwinds should support stable or potentially higher future coal sales volumes and improve longer-term revenue visibility for Alliance Resource Partners.

What’s fueling the optimism behind this price target? The answer could rest on a unique blend of future profit forecasts and margin resilience rarely seen in today’s energy market. Unpack the narrative's bold projection and see if the numbers add up to the premium analysts are betting on.

Result: Fair Value of $30.5 (UNDERVALUED)

However, long-term coal demand may be challenged if domestic energy policy shifts or if sustained declines in coal prices continue.

Resilient: When paired with smart grids and batteries, clean energy boosts grid security.
Today, that means reducing our reliance on foreign-controlled clean energy components.
Clean energy dominance isn’t just about climate.","For decades, American energy dominance was measured in oil barrels and gas pipelines. But in a world powered by artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, true energy leadership is about more than fuel — it’s about building and owning the systems that power tomorrow’s economy.

Energy remains the backbone of economic and national strength. But how we use and produce it is changing rapidly. AI and cloud computing are driving massive new electricity demand. Data centers alone could more than double their energy use worldwide by 2030. In the U.S., they are projected to account for nearly half of all new electricity demand — alongside growth in electric vehicles, robotics and electrified industry.

Meeting this surge is a strategic challenge. The nation that builds the infrastructure for the AI-powered economy will lead the global one.

To meet rising demand, America needs a diverse, secure energy mix — from fossil fuels to solar, wind, advanced nuclear, hydrogen and storage. This isn’t ideology. It’s national interest.

Clean energy is:

Homegrown: Sun, wind and geothermal heat can’t be imported from adversaries.

Resilient: When paired with smart grids and batteries, clean energy boosts grid security.

Economically smart: Renewables are cost-competitive and create millions of American jobs.

Exportable: The U.S. can lead by exporting next-generation energy tech and infrastructure.

We shouldn’t just adapt to the energy transition — we should lead it.

Energy independence has long been a bipartisan goal. Today, that means reducing our reliance on foreign-controlled clean energy components. Right now, China controls more than 70% of global production capacity for solar panels, batteries and the minerals needed to build them.

That’s a strategic vulnerability. To secure our future, we must:

Re-shore manufacturing of clean tech.

Strengthen domestic mining and refining.

Build alliances to diversify global supply chains.

None of this works without a modern grid. That means:

Building cyber-resilient, high-capacity transmission.

Speeding up permitting while protecting safety and property.

Supporting U.S. innovation across energy technologies.

Clean energy dominance isn’t just about climate. It’s also about jobs, security and sovereignty. By investing in innovation, infrastructure and independence, America can lead the intelligent age — just as it led the industrial one.

340B a profit machine

Living with multiple chronic conditions means I know health care costs intimately. Every month, I weigh medication expenses against other living expenses — and sometimes the math forces me to delay or skip doses I need. Across Illinois and nationwide, countless patients face this same brutal calculus.

Despite understanding our health care system well, I was stunned to discover how a program designed to help vulnerable patients has become a profit machine for big hospitals and pharmacies.

Perhaps most people haven’t heard of the 340B prescription drug benefit, created in 1992 to help safety-net clinics serve low-income patients. Today, hundreds of big hospital systems have taken full advantage of this program. Instead of passing drug discounts to struggling patients, many hospitals pocket the difference as pure profit. Patients like me remain oblivious that our lifesaving medications generate millions for these institutions.

The betrayal deepens: Our state legislature wants to systemize the worst abuses through a law that would further enrich for-profit pharmacies at patients’ expense. While 340B desperately needs reform, those changes must come from Congress — and they must put patients first, not hospital profit margins.

The program meant to be our safety net has become their cash cow. It’s time to reclaim it.

— Karen Brown, Chicago

Transparency in 340B

Manufacturers make the world a better place to live, and there’s no clearer example of the impact they have on our daily lives than the wide array of safe and effective pharmaceuticals available to prevent, treat and manage medical conditions.

The production of reliable, quality medication is vital to public health, and manufacturers don’t take this responsibility lightly. That’s why biopharmaceutical manufacturers are committed to improving access to medicines in underserved communities, ensuring low-income and vulnerable populations can receive discounted drugs.

Initially, that was the promise of the 340B drug pricing program, which was designed to provide discounted medications to eligible health care providers serving low-income and vulnerable patients. Unfortunately, the program is increasingly being used by large, affluent health systems with little assurance savings are reaching the intended patients.

Consider the numbers: Only 21% of 340B pharmacy locations in Illinois are in low-income neighborhoods, and nearly 60% of participating hospitals provide less charity care than the national average. Unfortunately, legislation under consideration in Springfield would do little to address this. Instead, it would provide substantial protection for covered entities while obscuring the disclosure of their financial arrangements, making it impossible to see how much benefit is diverted from patients to these intermediaries.

If lawmakers want to lower health care costs, we need real transparency and accountability in 340B. Let’s work together to ensure low-income patients benefit from reduced drug prices, not the bottom lines of large hospital systems.

— Mark Denzler, president and CEO, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, Springfield

A fair map in Illinois

Kudos to the Tribune Editorial Board (“We strongly support this bipartisan plan to fix Illinois’ broken state elections,” Oct. 5) for its editorial support for fixing the broken state election system in Illinois with a fairer redistricting plan that would let voters pick their representatives going forward rather than the other way around!

The U.S. Constitution purports to guarantee each state a republican (with a small “r”) form of government, but that is not what a state has when districts are cynically drawn up to ensure one-party control, as is currently the case in Illinois.

It is therefore good to see a bipartisan effort led by prominent Democrat Bill Daley and Republican Ray LaHood to get a referendum on the ballot in November 2026 for an Illinois constitutional amendment to permit this and that Fair Maps Illinois has a specific plan to recommend, should the amendment pass.

That other states may also currently engage in partisan redistricting is no excuse for Illinoisans not to clean up our act, and — frankly — it rings hollow to hear Illinois politicians complain about other states when our own state has such unclean hands.

I thank the editorial board for its support of the Daley-LaHood proposal, and I urge all Illinois voters to sign the petition to help restore government of the people, by the people and for the people to the Land of Lincoln.

— David L. Applegate, Huntley

We can’t yield ground

Although the editorial proposal to make Illinois “fairer” in its elections is interesting, I believe the Tribune Editorial Board misses the point.

Republicans under President Donald Trump are busy gerrymandering Democrats out of existence in states such as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina. Illinois under Democratic leadership remains one of the few states in the country to stand up for humane, progressive values; immigrants; and minority rights.

Until both sides play fair, I believe Illinois cannot yield to Republican pressure to add seats, and this will never happen as long as Trump rules. I am proud to live in Illinois where the common citizen still has some rights over the rich and powerful. We can’t afford to yield any ground now.

— Ken Kramer, Glen Ellyn

Disagreement in church

The Rev. Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic priest, writes in an op-ed on Oct. 6 about the inconsistency between Catholic Church teaching and the practice of the same by some (“Public fight among Illinois bishops hurting church, nation”). He mentions the American Catholic Church several times being in disagreement with itself and briefly compares it with “African traditions” being “sacred spaces of decision.”

He correctly implies that Catholic Church doctrine is universal, i.e., global, but he minimizes the reality that the church exists in a world where nations play a major role in how Catholic teaching is practiced. The church views itself as being “in the world but not part of it.”

The role of the church is aimed at what is best for humans as taught by Christ, i.e., “full spectrum of human dignity and the common good.” In the secular world of nations, the same ideals for the most part are also sought. But a nation, in order to continue to be a nation, must first do what is necessary to preserve its nationhood, and that sometimes impinges on Catholic teaching, even causing disagreement within a nation’s Catholics.

Disagreement is part of the human experience, however, and hopefully brings about a positive result.

It may be, at some point in the future, that selling Toledo Bend water is an idea that makes sense from a financial and resource-management perspective.","It's not often that Louisiana balks at an offer to sell its natural resources for cash.

That's why it's a pleasant surprise to see two state legislators warn the Sabine River Authority that any attempt to sell water from the Toledo Bend Reservoir is a nonstarter. It's even better that the two legislators, Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, and Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, chair committees that would need to bless any such sale.

For those who have not spent time on the bucolic, 186,000-acre, 65-mile-long reservoir located on Louisiana's western border, let me explain. Toledo Bend was created when the Sabine River was dammed in the 1960s. It's become extremely popular as a recreation and fishing spot for thousands from both Louisiana and Texas.

It's governed jointly by Louisiana and Texas, through two different authorities, one on each side of the border. Water that flows through the dam on the reservoir's southern end is used to generate hydroelectric power; each side has the authority to sell some of the water, though the proceeds must be split.

But for several years, there have been discussions about selling a portion of Louisiana's share of the water to a company called Aqueduct Partners, which would pipe it to water-starved cities in Texas. Proponents argue that this sale could be done with little to no impact on lake levels and generate far more revenue than hydroelectric generation.

But the idea has drawn opposition from many locals, who argue that such a sale could cause water levels to drop and make the reservoir less amenable to recreation.

Earlier this week, Geymann and Hensgens sent a letter to Louisiana's Sabine River Authority, urging them to reject any proposed sale.

""We urge you to abandon these plans and safeguard the long-term interests of our people, economy and environment,"" Geymann and Hensgens wrote. ""Toledo Bend is vital to Louisiana residents, businesses and wildlife.""

They are right about that. But more important is something Hensgens told this newspaper's David Mitchell.

""I just believe that in the next century, water is going to be the most important natural resource we've got, and it is Louisiana's water. It belongs to the state taxpayers, and I just don't believe we should be selling it,"" Hensgens said.

Hensgens is absolutely right about this. Water is an increasingly valuable natural resource. Fortunately for Louisiana, the state is blessed with plenty of it both on the surface and under it. But there is little statewide impetus to take an accounting of just how much, despite increasing demands from industry, agriculture and, potentially, more data centers, which use a lot of water.

In other words, Louisiana is obviously water rich, but we have no idea exactly how rich we are. And until we know how much we have, we shouldn't be selling what we do have, no matter how tempting the dollar signs dangled by rich Texans.

Thankfully, Geymann and Hensgens' letter seems to indicate, at least for now, that no such deal will go forward.

It may be, at some point in the future, that selling Toledo Bend water is an idea that makes sense from a financial and resource-management perspective.

But that time has not yet come.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c4/6c4c578a-0ecc-54f8-8811-d036888c7de2/68d76ab30c7b2.image.jpg?crop=1602%2C841%2C29%2C2&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-12 13:07:13.446273

Across the country, more and more farmers have embraced solar power to make their farms run cleaner and protect the land they depend on while saving on utility costs.

Living and working in rural areas demands you to be self-sufficient. One of the best ways to ensure that people in rural areas have power – no matter how far they live from the nearest utility connection – is through solar power. By producing their own clean electricity, farmers can protect their livelihoods from an increasingly strained grid.

Many farmers across America are choosing solar for its reliability and cleanliness, in turn taking care of the soil, air and water that sustain us all. Solar allows farmers to ensure that the hard work they put into feeding the country is also benefiting the planet as a whole.

Here are three big ways farmers across America are putting solar to work:

Rooftop solar

As sure as the sun rises every morning, rooftop solar is a great way to harness all of that untapped power right on the same buildings that will use it. Barns have ample roof space and can collect a significant amount of energy to power a variety of farm equipment.

Just like so many households and businesses across the country, America’s farmers are reaping the benefits of rooftop solar. PennEnvironment, one of our 30 state groups, toured Shelmar Acres Farm (pictured above) in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After seeing their electricity price skyrocket, they took the plunge, installing solar on their hog barn and have not looked back. Soon after installation, Mitchell and Heather saw their electric bills drop from several thousand dollars a month to a few hundred.

Solar panels across farms: Agrivoltaics

Placing solar panels in strategic locations alongside crops (a practice called agrivoltaics) can have great benefits. Some forward-thinking farmers are installing solar panels on pastures, allowing sheep to graze under solar panel installations. This both prevents plant overgrowth, cutting down on mowing needs, and allows space for sheep to thrive. A study from Western University also highlighted the financial benefits of setups like these.

Agrivoltaics can also be great for pollinators. By planting pollinator friendly plants under solar panel installations, Farmers create some peace and security for bees, butterflies and other wildlife, all while helping to pollinate the surrounding areas. If well designed, pollinator friendly installations can improve crop pollination allowing for potentially higher yields.

Sun-powered equipment

With technology advancing every day, farmers are coming up with more ingenious ways to harness the power of the sun. Solar-powered water pumps are extremely versatile; they can be set up to work anywhere and make lugging gas to generators a thing of the past. Farmers are able to use solar-powered water pumps to irrigate their plants, provide water for their livestock or pump water to reservoirs for storage.

""Battery storage is one of the most critical, yet often overlooked, components of a successful energy transition. This project is a key demonstration of how Sungrow's technology provides the grid flexibility that is essential for the next phase of Europe's renewable energy journey,"" said Moritz Rolf, Vice President of Sungrow Europe, responsible for the business in DACH, BeNeLux, Nordics, and Turkey. ""Our strategic and successful partnership with ENGIE on the Vilvoorde project, emphasizes the important role of battery storage in delivering clean power for all, and strengthens our commitment to the European market.""

Optimistic step forward for modern energy infrastructure

The Vilvoorde project represents an optimistic step forward in modernizing Europe's energy infrastructure as the continent works towards its 2050 sustainability goals. By absorbing surplus energy during periods of high production and releasing it back to the grid when demand is high, large-scale battery storage ensures flexible, but stable electricity supply from renewable sources. This installation of a large-scale Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) serves as a blueprint for effectively integrating renewable energy into legacy infrastructure – balancing the grid and mitigating issues with net congestion.

Safe, smart and efficient BESS

Both phases of the ENGIE project are enabled by Sungrow's PowerTitan units deployed on-site. Sungrow's BESS solutions are engineered with compact design for quick deployment and operational efficiency – both of which are critical factors for large-scale infrastructure. The system's slim design optimizes land use and features intelligently connected, liquid-cooled technology, ensuring a temperature-controlled, cost-effective, and reliable system. These technological elements guarantee a safe and sustainable integration of large-scale energy storage into the power grid.

""With the first series of batteries now operational in Vilvoorde, ENGIE is delivering part of the additional flexibility the electricity grid requires to balance supply and demand. The efficient construction of this battery park is only possible thanks to strong partnerships. By working hand in hand with trusted and innovative partners such as Sungrow, we can continue to accelerate the integration of renewables into the grid, and help deliver a more reliable, sustainable and affordable energy system,"" said Vincent Verbeke, CEO of ENGIE Belgium.

Texas. We're known for big hats, presidents, and oil and gas. So it might suprise you that when the Energy Information Administration asks ""how much #windpower is produced in each state?"" the Lone Star State comes out on top. Oh, howdy, Texas:

Earlier this week, ERCOT, the grid operator for most of Texas, announced that wind supplied nearly 10 percent of the state's energy in 2013, up from 9 percent in 2012 and 5 percent in 2008.

Full disclosure: as aTexan I am quite pleased that we're ahead of BOTH California and Oklahoma. Energy is an important piece of Texas history, and wind is as much a part of Texas' story as oil and gas and has its roots back to Ann Richards and George W. Bush's terms as governors of the state along with healthy support from the federal government in terms of a $23/MWh production tax credit, which is on its way out.

This month’s League of Women Voters of Los Alamos (LWV) community event, Lunch with a Leader, is 11:45 a.m. to 1 p.m., Thursday, Oct. 16, at the Unitarian Fellowship Hall on Sage Street. This month’s speaker is award-winning journalist Danielle Prokop.

Prokop was born and raised in Los Alamos. While pursuing international studies at the University of New Mexico, she got her first taste for print at the Daily Lobo, and hasn’t stopped since. After graduation, she worked at the Santa Fe New Mexican, first on the copy desk and eventually on general assignment.

In 2020, Prokop moved (sight unseen) to the western Nebraska panhandle, covering wildfires, water fights and paved road drama for the Scottsbluff Star-Herald. She then headed to far west Texas, embarking on environmental coverage for both sides of the Rio Grande in El Paso.

Prokop returned to writing stories about New Mexico in 2022, first as a freelancer, then full-time staff writer for the online publication Source NM. Her work has included a 14-part series on the Rio Grande from Colorado through New Mexico and west Texas and breaking news inside the Roundhouse and along roads less traveled.

One of the topics she will address during her Thursday talk is whether the role journalism plays in society is changing.

That US-driven dip drags down the agency’s global projections for renewable energy growth by 5 percent.

If you live in the United States, you could be forgiven for thinking that renewable energy is on the outs. In July, Congress voted to rapidly phase out longstanding tax credit support for wind and solar power, and the Trump administration has taken seemingly every step in its power to halt the development of individual wind and solar projects—even as domestic electricity demand rises and new sources of electricity become more important than ever.

But even as clean energy deployment hit roadblocks in the United States, the world overall set a new record for renewable energy investment over the first half of this year. Wind and solar power are meeting and even exceeding a global rise in energy demand. Indeed, electricity output from these sources is increasing faster than the world can use it, displacing some fossil fuel-generated power in the process. That’s according to a report published Tuesday by Ember, a global energy think tank, which mapped this year’s global power supply by analyzing monthly data from 88 countries that are responsible for more than 90 percent of global electricity demand.

“Overall—we’re talking globally—renewables overtook coal,” said Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at Ember and a co-author of the company’s report. “And I expect this to hold.” This year marks the first time that renewable energy sources have outpowered coal in the global energy mix. In fact, global use of fossil fuels for electricity actually declined slightly, compared to the same period in 2024.

Another report published this week by the International Energy Agency, or IEA, an intergovernmental energy research and policy organization, projects that the quantity of installed renewable power—meaning the maximum amount of energy that can be produced by systems like solar fields, hydroelectric dams, and wind turbines—will more than double by the end of this decade. National policies encouraging the development of green technology as well as astounding drops in the price of solar power—primarily driven by Chinese manufacturers, which build more than 80 percent of the world’s solar energy components—are largely driving the transition.

And even that projection may be conservative.

“The IEA has, consistently over the last couple of decades, way underestimated how fast renewables are growing,” said Robert Brecha, a senior climate and energy adviser at Climate Analytics, a global climate science and policy institute, who was not involved in either the Ember or IEA report. “I don’t see any reason to believe that renewables won’t double by 2030.”

The vast majority of the renewable energy projected to go online in the coming years will come from solar, which already met more than 80 percent of new global energy demand in the first six months of 2025, according to the Ember report. In China, the largest renewable energy growth market in the world, and in India, which is on pace to become the second-largest market, a major uptick in solar energy output is responsible for a historic global decline in coal-generated power.

In the United States and the European Union, however, fossil fuel generation rose in the first half of this year. In Europe, poor wind conditions and drought, rather than state policies, took a bite out of the bloc’s wind and hydroelectric production, leading to a 14-percent rise in gas-fired power. Across the Atlantic, US coal-fired power generation rose 17 percent.

The policy outlook for renewables in the United States is so bleak that the IEA lowered the country’s renewable capacity growth expectations by 50 percent compared to last year’s projections. That US-driven dip drags down the agency’s global projections for renewable energy growth by 5 percent. Overall, however, the IEA still expects renewable energy capacity to grow even faster between 2025 and 2030 than it did between 2020 and 2025.",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-Solar-Farm_2185482692-1.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-11 23:59:01.990003

Outlook: The Road Ahead for Tesla As of October 11, 2025, Tesla stands at an important inflection point.
If it stalls (perhaps due to economic factors or insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions), Tesla’s growth could moderate.","Stock Price & Performance: Tesla’s share price recently surged to the mid-$450s (up ~5% in one day on Oct 6) after strong sales news, adding roughly $70+ billion to its market cap [1]. However, after a new product reveal on Oct 7, TSLA slipped about 4% (a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction), settling in the low-$430s by week’s end [2]. As of Oct 10, 2025, the stock trades around $435, near the higher end of its 52-week range ($212 – $488) [3]. Tesla is up roughly 12% year-to-date (lagging the S&P 500’s ~17% gain) and an astounding ~80% in the past 12 months [4] [5]. Daily volatility is high, with 4–5% swings not uncommon in recent sessions [6].

Record Q3 Sales:Tesla shattered delivery records in Q3 2025, handing over 497,099 vehicles worldwide [7] – far above Wall Street’s ~443k estimate [8]. Production was ~447k, meaning Tesla sold more cars than it built by drawing down inventory [9]. The 7% YoY delivery growth was fueled by a last-minute demand surge before the U.S. EV tax credit expiration on Sept 30 [10]. Tesla’s aggressive end-of-quarter discounts and financing deals “pulled forward” buyers to beat the deadline [11]. While investors cheered the blowout sales, analysts cautioned it may steal from Q4 demand now that the $7,500 federal incentive has lapsed [12] [13]. Indeed, TSLA initially dipped ~3% on the delivery report as the market pondered a possible Q4 sales slump [14].

“Affordable” Model Y/3 Launch: On Oct 7, Tesla unveiled new lower-cost “Standard Range” versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively [15]. These models offer >300 miles of range on smaller batteries but omit premium features (no Autosteer, rear seat heaters, etc.) to cut costs [16] [17]. CEO Elon Musk pitched the trims as “affordable” Teslas for a broader market, acknowledging many people “don’t have enough money” for pricier EVs [18] [19]. However, investors were underwhelmed – TSLA stock tumbled ~4–4.5% after the announcement [20] [21]. Even bullish analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives expressed “disappointment” that prices were only ~$5k lower than existing trims [22] [23]. The consensus: this was “a pricing lever, not a product catalyst,” unlikely to unlock massive new demand [24] [25]. Many experts say Tesla “needs a sub-$30k EV” to truly expand its market long-term [26].

Analyst Sentiment & Targets: Wall Street’s view on TSLA is highly divided. Big-name bulls remain optimistic: Morgan Stanley recently reiterated an Overweight (Buy) rating with a $410 target [27], Piper Sandler hiked its target from $400 to $500 [28], and Wedbush’s Dan Ives is all the way up at $600, one of the Street’s highest forecasts [29]. They cite Tesla’s momentum in EVs, software, and energy as justification for a premium valuation [30] [31]. However, the average 12-month price target is only ~$351, implying analysts on the whole think the stock is overvalued at current levels [32]. Roughly half of analysts rate TSLA a Hold or Sell [33], flagging the lofty valuation (~250× earnings) and slowing growth as concerns [34] [35]. Notably, HSBC recently stuck to a “Reduce” (Sell) rating and a mere $127 target despite the strong Q3 sales – implying ~70% downside [36]. In short, sentiment ranges from ultra-bullish to deeply skeptical, reflecting Tesla’s polarizing dual identity as both carmaker and high-growth tech play.

Tesla’s Strategic Shifts: Tesla is doubling down on its core EV business while also branching into new frontiers. The company’s energy division just had a record quarter, deploying 12.5 GWh of battery storage (Powerwalls, Megapacks, etc.) – more than all of 2024’s total – signaling rapid growth in Tesla’s solar/storage segment [37]. Musk is also heavily emphasizing AI and automation: Tesla’s vehicles have logged 7+ billion miles on Autopilot/FSD, giving it the world’s largest self-driving dataset [38], and in 2025 Tesla even launched a pilot robotaxi service (using driverless Model Ys in Austin) [39]. Musk touts upcoming Full Self-Driving software updates that feel “almost sentient” [40], and Tesla continues to showcase its “Optimus” humanoid robot prototype – though that remains a longer-term project [41]. On the automotive side, Tesla’s lineup is both expanding “broader and cheaper” (e.g. the new Model Y/3 variants) to fend off competition, and looking ahead to futuristic products (Cybertruck, Robotaxi) and services. Investors are watching whether Tesla can execute on these initiatives without sacrificing margins, as recent price cuts have squeezed profitability (automotive gross margin has slid to mid-single digits) [42]. Overall, Tesla’s current strategy aims to balance near-term growth (via volume and price tweaks) with long-term innovation in AI and clean energy – a tricky but potentially rewarding path.

Recent Stock Performance: From Rally to Pullback

Tesla’s stock has seen dramatic swings in early October 2025. After trading in the low-$400s to start the month, TSLA spiked on October 6 ahead of a big product announcement, jumping ~5.4% in one session to close at $453.25 [43]. That surge – adding over $70 billion in market cap – was fueled by optimism around record Q3 sales and a teased new model. It capped a strong short-term run: Tesla shares climbed roughly 7–8% over the first two weeks of October, outperforming the broader market (the S&P 500 rose more modestly) [44] [45]. Notably, 7 of 10 trading days were positive during that stretch [46]. At mid-$450s, Tesla was trading near its 52-week high (~$488) and more than 50% above its yearly low (~$212) [47]. In fact, over the past 12 months TSLA was up about 81%, a huge run compared to ~17% for the S&P 500 in the same period [48].

However, volatility remains part of Tesla’s story. After the Oct 6 rally, traders turned skittish once details of the new product came out. On Oct 7–8, TSLA pulled back roughly 4% – essentially erasing the early-week pop [49]. The stock dropped from the mid-$450s back to around $430–$435, as investors “sold the news” when Tesla’s “affordable” Model Y/3 pricing disappointed some expectations [50]. By the end of that week, Tesla settled in the low-$430s (still up slightly from a week prior). These whipsaw moves underline Tesla’s elevated volatility: in recent weeks, daily swings of 4–5% have been common [51]. Short-term traders note the stock became overbought after the run-up – technical indicators like RSI signaled stretched conditions [52]. Indeed, TSLA’s relative strength index hit levels that often precede a breather, and some chart analysts pegged support around ~$410 and near-term resistance around ~$530 [53]. In other words, the stock’s momentum is strong, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see consolidation or profit-taking after such a steep rise.

From a broader lens, Tesla’s year-to-date performance is decent but not market-leading. As of early October, TSLA was up roughly 12% in 2025 [54]. That trails the S&P 500 (which is up ~17% YTD) [55], reflecting that Tesla had some choppiness earlier in the year. However, the recent rally significantly boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to around $1.5 trillion [56] – putting it among the world’s top 10 most valuable companies. The stock’s 52-week range (about $212 to $488 [57]) highlights how far it has climbed from last year’s lows, but also the fact that it’s only ~6–10% shy of new all-time highs. This lofty perch means valuation metrics are stretched (more on that later), and it raises the stakes for Tesla to deliver consistently strong results to justify the price. In sum, Tesla’s recent stock performance has been a mix of euphoria and volatility – typical for TSLA – with rapid gains driven by excitement over sales and products, tempered by quick pullbacks whenever reality checks in.

Recent News: Record Q3 Deliveries and New Model Reveals

Tesla kicked off October with headline-grabbing news on multiple fronts. First, on October 2, the company reported record-breaking vehicle delivery numbers for Q3 2025. Tesla delivered 497,099 cars in the quarter [58], an all-time high and well above analyst forecasts in the mid-440k range [59]. This marked about 7.4% growth year-over-year [60], a notable rebound considering Tesla’s deliveries had actually declined YoY in the first half of 2025 amid economic headwinds [61]. The Q3 production figure was ~447k vehicles [62], meaning Tesla sold more cars than it built, drawing down some inventory – a sign of strong demand (at least temporarily). The Model 3 and Model Y remained the workhorses, accounting for the vast majority of sales (over 481k of the 497k) while higher-priced Models S/X and the new Cybertruck comprised the remainder [63].

What drove this Q3 sales surge? In a word: incentives. U.S. buyers rushed to take delivery before a major federal EV subsidy expired on Sept 30. Tesla had been benefiting from a $7,500 federal tax credit on many of its models, but due to how the law was structured (with volume and battery sourcing criteria), that credit was set to phase out for Tesla at the end of Q3 [64]. Knowing this, Tesla “pulled out all the stops” in Q3 – offering discounts, special financing deals, and even running social media ads – to entice customers to buy before the credit vanished [65]. The strategy worked: many would-be buyers hurried to lock in the expiring $7.5k credit, resulting in a huge end-of-quarter sales push [66]. Analysts described it as “pulled-forward” demand – essentially Tesla borrowed sales from the future (Q4) to boost Q3 [67]. An ETF manager, Elliot Johnson, warned this won’t be sustainable, predicting “we could see a soft couple of quarters” ahead [68]. Indeed, Tesla’s stock initially dropped ~3–4% on the delivery report [69], as investors digested the idea that Q4 might slump now that the tax-credit rush is over.

Tesla’s team acknowledged some regional weaknesses despite the record global number. In Europe, for example, Tesla’s sales fell over 22% in August (year-on-year), shrinking Tesla’s EU EV market share to ~1.5% [70]. European consumers are increasingly drawn to a flood of new EV options – including popular plug-in hybrids and lower-cost Chinese-made EVs – forcing Tesla to respond with price cuts and promotions [71]. By contrast, China was a bright spot: strong demand for the refreshed Model Y and a new long-wheelbase Model Y “L” variant helped boost Tesla’s sales in China [72]. (Tesla introduced the Model Y “L” in September specifically to appeal to Chinese families, as part of a strategy to tailor products to local markets [73].) Tesla also notched a win in its energy business during Q3: it deployed 12.5 GWh of battery storage (Powerwall home batteries, grid-scale Megapacks, etc.), exceeding analyst expectations (~11 GWh) and even surpassing the total storage deployment in all of 2024 [74]. This suggests Tesla’s energy segment – often overshadowed by the car business – is scaling quickly, providing a valuable additional revenue stream [75].

Just as the dust settled from the delivery report, Tesla teased a major product announcement for Oct 7, 2025. Over the prior weekend, the company’s official account on X (Twitter) posted cryptic teaser videos – glowing headlights in the dark, a spinning wheel – ending with the date “10/7” [76]. This sparked rampant speculation of a new, more affordable vehicle launch. The anticipation alone helped drive Tesla’s stock up 5% on Monday Oct 6 ahead of the reveal [77]. Come October 7, Tesla indeed unveiled “Standard Range” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, positioned as cheaper trims to broaden the buyer base. The Model Y Standard now starts at $39,990, and the Model 3 Standard at $36,990 [78] – roughly a 15% price reduction compared to the previous base models [79]. To hit these lower price points, Tesla trimmed some features: the Standard versions have slightly smaller batteries (but still ~320 miles of range), slower acceleration, and they lack certain amenities like Tesla’s Autosteer driver assist, rear heated seats, the upgraded audio system, and even minor touches like the LED lightbar on the Model Y [80] [81]. They also come with manual side mirrors and textile (cloth) seats by default, though buyers can pay extra for vegan leather in the Model 3 [82].

Musk’s pitch for these models was straightforward: boosting affordability to counter a tough market. “The desire to buy the car is very high… [it’s] just people don’t have enough money,” Musk said on a prior earnings call, “so the more affordable we can make the car, the better.” [83] By launching sub-$40k versions, Tesla is attempting to revive demand amid sagging sales growth and the loss of U.S. tax credits [84] [85]. Importantly, these new Standard Range cars can be ordered immediately, with deliveries slated to begin in Dec 2025–Jan 2026 in many regions [86] – timing that could help Tesla shore up Q4 and early 2026 sales.

Market reaction, however, was mixed. While some applauded Tesla for finally breaking below the $40k psychological barrier, many analysts felt the move was “not enough” to significantly expand Tesla’s audience [87]. The ~$5,000 price cut versus prior base models was seen as relatively small – “basically a pricing lever and not much of a product catalyst,” as Futurum Research strategist Shay Boloor put it [88] [89]. The fear is that these “affordable” Teslas might simply prompt existing Tesla intenders to choose a cheaper trim (cannibalizing some higher-trim sales) rather than bringing new budget-conscious buyers into the fold [90] [91]. Wedbush’s Dan Ives (a longtime Tesla bull) bluntly said he was “disappointed” by the modest price drop, expecting more aggressive cuts to fend off competitors [92]. Meanwhile, Shawn Campbell of Camelthorn Investments argued “I just don’t know that this is enough… Tesla needs a sub-$30k EV” to truly counter the onslaught of lower-cost Chinese models globally [93]. On Wall Street, traders had largely priced in a big announcement, so when the news proved incremental, TSLA’s stock fell ~4.5% on Oct 7 [94]. Essentially, the market “bought the rumor, sold the news” – Tesla’s huge rally earlier that week was given back once details emerged [95].

Despite the initial stock dip, Tesla executives likely view the Standard Range launch as a strategic pivot to defend market share. It shows Tesla is willing to sacrifice some margin for volume, which could be crucial as EV competition heats up. The move also anticipates new rivals: for instance, GM’s Chevrolet is launching an Equinox EV around ~$30k in 2024–25, and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Kia’s EV4 are targeting similar segments [96]. By pricing just under $40k, Tesla at least narrows the gap. Still, some industry watchers nicknamed Tesla’s approach as “dropping its Steve Jobs turtleneck for a Walmart hoodie” – i.e. Tesla shedding a bit of its premium aura to play in the mass market [97]. One investment officer quipped that Tesla is “no longer the cool rebel at the edge of innovation – it’s the establishment trying to play both Tesla and Toyota at once.” [98] Time will tell if this balancing act pays off by boosting unit sales without diluting Tesla’s brand or profits.

Analyst Ratings and Market Sentiment: Bulls vs. Bears

Tesla is one of the most polarizing stocks on Wall Street, and the recent developments have only amplified the divide between bulls and bears. Optimistic analysts (“bulls”) view Tesla not just as a car company but as a transformational tech leader spanning electric vehicles, software, and energy – a narrative reinforced by the Q3 delivery beat and new product momentum. For example, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed its Overweight (Buy) rating right after the blowout delivery report, keeping a $410 price target [99]. Morgan Stanley’s lead auto analyst Adam Jonas highlighted Tesla’s “strong momentum” and multi-pronged growth engines (EV market dominance, Full Self-Driving software potential, and a booming energy storage business) as reasons Tesla can justify a rich valuation [100] [101]. Similarly, Piper Sandler’s team (led by Alexander Potter) has been bullish – they reportedly raised their TSLA target from $400 to $500 in late September while maintaining an overweight stance [102]. And perhaps the most outspoken bull, Dan Ives of Wedbush, is at the high end with a ~$600 price target [103]. Ives believes Tesla’s recent catalysts (the record deliveries, new cheaper Model Y, progress in AI/robotaxis) could significantly boost long-term earnings power [104]. These bullish analysts argue Tesla is far more than an automaker – pointing to its vast trove of driving data (over 7 billion miles on Autopilot) and its subscription-like revenue from software and energy products as evidence that Tesla can eventually deliver higher-margin tech/services revenue alongside car sales [105] [106]. Firms like Cantor Fitzgerald have likewise chimed in, recently reiterating an Overweight rating and praising Tesla’s execution after the delivery surprise [107]. In short, the bull camp believes Tesla’s growth story is intact and expanding – and that its hefty valuation will be earned as the company grows into new markets (energy, autonomous ride-hailing, possibly robotics).

On the flip side, a large segment of analysts take a cautious or neutral stance, and a minority are firmly bearish. As of early October, the consensus 12-month price target for Tesla was only about $351 [108]. With the stock hovering around $450, that implies the average analyst sees ~20–25% downside risk from current prices [109] [110]. Ratings-wise, the Street is roughly split down the middle: out of ~34 major analysts covering Tesla, about 11 rate it a Buy, 16 as Hold, and 7 as Sell [111]. Those in the neutral camp often acknowledge Tesla’s strengths and recent wins but express concern that expectations have run ahead of fundamentals. One illustrative data point: Tesla’s trailing 12-month revenue (~$93 billion) was actually down ~12% year-over-year (due to earlier slowdowns and price cuts), even as the stock price climbed, leading to what one report called an “extreme valuation expansion.” [112] In concrete terms, Tesla is trading around 250 times earnings and ~16–17 times sales – sky-high multiples that assume significant future growth [113] [114]. By comparison, other carmakers trade at single-digit P/Es, and even most tech giants trade at a fraction of Tesla’s valuation. Margin pressure is another worry: with all the price reductions, Tesla’s vehicle gross profit margins have fallen from around 25%+ a year ago to the mid-teens or even single digits now [115]. (Some estimates put Tesla’s automotive gross margin ex-credits in the high single digits in recent quarters [116].) Slower growth + thinner margins = caution for these analysts, who fear Tesla might not meet the lofty earnings implied by its stock price.

Bearish analysts take it a step further, arguing that Tesla is dramatically overvalued and could have a nasty come-down. A notable example is HSBC, which in October reiterated a “Reduce” (Sell) rating. After the strong delivery report, HSBC did raise its price target – but only to $127 [117]. That’s essentially saying Tesla’s stock could fall over 70%. The bear case typically asserts that Tesla’s growth is maturing and facing headwinds: competition is eroding its market share (as seen in Europe’s decline), Tesla’s repeated price cuts indicate demand needs artificial boosting, and if you value Tesla more like a normal automaker (even a premium one), the current valuation is absurdly high [118] [119]. Bears also point to Tesla’s reliance on regulatory credits to pad profits and the possibility that as EV markets mature, Tesla’s first-mover advantage will shrink. Some skeptics are wary of Elon Musk’s unpredictable management style as a risk factor – for instance, concern that Musk’s other ventures (SpaceX, running X/Twitter, etc.) could distract him, or that his cavalier approach to things like timelines and regulatory issues might backfire. Overall, the bearish view is that Tesla’s stock price already reflects “perfection” – any stumble in execution or demand could lead to a major correction.

This stark divergence in views is encapsulated by the extremely wide range of analyst price targets: from about $120 on the low end to $600 on the high end [120] [121]. Such a spread is highly unusual for a company of Tesla’s size and speaks to the unique nature of Tesla’s investment thesis. Is it a high-growth tech disrupter that will double its value with new businesses, or a highly valued car company that could crash back to earth? At present, the average target of ~$351 implies many analysts think TSLA has overshot its fundamentals by ~20-30% [122] [123]. Those fundamentals will be tested soon – Tesla’s Q3 financial results in late October and any guidance about Q4 demand will be key inputs for analysts updating their models [124]. For now, sentiment remains split, and Tesla’s stock continues to trade on future potential vs. present reality, depending on whom you ask.

Expert Commentary and Forecasts

Amid the analyst debates, financial experts and commentators have been offering insight into Tesla’s future performance. On the bullish side, many point to Tesla’s expanding opportunities in software and services. “Tesla’s dominant position in EVs, first-mover advantage in autonomy, and burgeoning energy business support its extraordinary valuation,” noted one analysis [125]. Bulls often highlight cross-platform synergies – for instance, Tesla’s ability to leverage data and AI from its car fleet into other areas like self-driving taxis or even robots, and to use its automotive scale to grow its stationary battery business. These unique combinations, they argue, make Tesla more than the sum of its parts and justify thinking of it as a high-growth tech platform rather than a car company.

On the cautious side, some experts flag Tesla’s recent financial trends as a sign of overextension. One report observed that Tesla’s revenue growth has stalled relative to its stock price – in fact, trailing 12-month revenue slightly declined (due to earlier delivery dips and pricing actions) while the stock ran up, leading to an unsustainable spike in valuation multiples [126]. That same report pointed out Tesla’s P/E above 250 and price-to-sales ~17, calling it an “eye-watering” valuation more fitting a cloud software company than a manufacturer [127]. To put it in perspective, even looking ahead a few years: Bloomberg analysts project Tesla might earn around $5.5 billion in annual profit by 2028, and if one applied a generous tech-sector P/E of 20× to that, it would only imply a $150–$250 stock price – far below today’s $450+ [128] [129]. This kind of exercise underscores why some value-focused investors think TSLA could halve in price if growth disappoints [130]. On the flip side, the most optimistic forecasts see Tesla doubling from here if things like robotaxi networks or mass-market cars take off and dramatically boost earnings [131] [132]. Such extreme outcomes – both up and down – are what make Tesla such a hot topic; it’s a high-reward, high-risk story.

We also heard direct commentary from Tesla’s Q3 delivery fallout. Elliot Johnson of Evolve ETFs, as mentioned, cautioned that the Q3 surge was not likely sustainable and that “we could see a soft couple of quarters” ahead as the pulled-ahead demand leaves a gap [133]. Regarding the new Standard models, Shay Boloor (Futurum Equities) commented that Tesla’s move is “not unlocking new demand at scale” and is more of a one-time pricing adjustment [134]. Dan Ives (Wedbush) – normally very bullish – voiced rare disappointment, essentially saying Tesla underwhelmed with only a minor price trim when expectations were higher [135]. On the other hand, some experts see the lower-priced models as necessary chess moves. “Dropping below $40k will help drive sales as [Tesla] competes next year with Chevy’s Equinox EV, Hyundai, Kia, etc.,” one investor noted [136], even if they hoped for a bigger cut to <$30k. There’s also acknowledgment that Tesla’s execution in Q3 was impressive – nearly 500k deliveries in a quarter was once unimaginable for an EV company. “Nearly 500k deliveries in a quarter is unprecedented for an EV maker,” as one commentator noted, adding that it shows Tesla can deliver volume when it pulls the right levers (in this case, incentives and pricing) [137].

Looking ahead, expert forecasts diverge mainly on whether Tesla can maintain its growth and expand into new markets fast enough to justify its valuation. Bulls like ARK Invest (Cathie Wood’s firm) – not quoted above but known publicly – have extremely high long-term targets based on scenarios of Tesla dominating autonomous ride-hailing and other fields. More conventional bulls, as we saw, peg upside around $500–600 if things go well [138]. Bears use more traditional models and often come out with targets in the low $100s (or even double-digit stock prices) if Tesla’s growth slows or if it gets valued more like an automaker. Many neutral analysts are in the $250–$350 range, essentially betting Tesla will execute decently but not perfectly. A key near-term factor will be Tesla’s Q3 earnings report on Oct 18 (and any guidance given) – analysts will parse margins, any commentary on order backlogs post-tax-credit, and Tesla’s cost management, especially with these new lower-priced vehicles in the mix. Additionally, Tesla’s 2025 outlook (perhaps hinted at in January’s Investor Day or in guidance) will shape forecasts: if Musk and team guide to reaccelerating growth (perhaps with the Cybertruck ramp or a next-gen vehicle), bulls will feel vindicated; if they emphasize margin and moderate growth, the valuation concerns could grow.

In summary, expert opinions range from “Tesla will continue to conquer new markets and justify its sky-high valuation” to “Tesla’s stock is due for a reality check.” This dynamic tension in forecasts is part of why Tesla’s stock is so volatile – news that supports one side or the other (e.g. a big beat or miss, a new product reveal, etc.) can swing market sentiment sharply. For the average observer, it’s wise to recognize that Tesla’s future is hard to pigeonhole: it has elements of an auto business, a tech company, and even a renewable energy utility. As one report put it, Tesla encapsulates a “dual nature: part established automaker, part speculative tech disruptor.” [139] This duality will likely continue to drive debate among experts and keep Tesla a closely watched stock.

Tesla’s Strategic Direction: EVs, Energy, AI, and More

Underpinning both the bull and bear cases is Tesla’s multifaceted strategic direction. The company is not standing still – it’s simultaneously pushing the envelope in technology and adjusting its core business strategy in the face of competition.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) remain Tesla’s core, and here the strategy has evolved in 2025 to defend its market lead. Tesla once rarely advertised or cut prices due to overwhelming demand; now it’s entering a phase of competitive pricing and product segmentation. The launch of the Standard Range models is a prime example – Tesla is willing to trim features and margin to broaden its customer base, signaling a more pragmatic, volume-driven approach as the EV market matures. Tesla is also tailoring cars to regions: e.g., the Model Y “L” variant in China (a longer-wheelbase Model Y to cater to Chinese families) [140], and constant software updates to adapt to local needs (charging standards, languages, etc.). On the horizon is the Cybertruck, Tesla’s futuristic pickup, which finally started deliveries in limited numbers (reportedly ~52,000 units sold since its late-2023 debut, which is modest) [141]. The Cybertruck is part of Tesla’s strategy to enter new segments (pickups, which are huge in the U.S.) and showcase engineering innovation (its stainless-steel body and novel design). However, its slow initial ramp shows Tesla faces challenges scaling completely new models. Musk has hinted at even more vehicles: a next-generation “$25k car” (often dubbed the Model 2 by fans) and a purpose-built robotaxi vehicle. In the recent earnings calls, Musk tempered expectations by noting a $25k personal car isn’t a priority (focusing on robotaxi development instead) [142] [143]. Tesla says an actual robotaxi vehicle (with no steering wheel) might debut around 2026, but that’s still speculative. In sum, Tesla’s automotive strategy is two-pronged: maintain dominance in premium EVs (with continuous improvements to Models S,3,X,Y and new high-end tech like Plaid drivetrains), and expand into new niches and price points to keep growth going (trucks, cheaper cars, etc.).

Beyond cars, Tesla’s Energy & Storage division is becoming a bigger part of the strategy. Q3’s record 12.5 GWh of battery storage deployments [144] highlight that Tesla is effectively building a second business alongside automotive. Products like the Megapack (a large battery for utilities) are in high demand from power companies and large facilities aiming to store renewable energy. In fact, Tesla’s Q3 storage deployments beat Wall Street estimates by ~14% [145], and even exceeded what Tesla installed in all of last year [146]. Musk and CFO Zach Kirkhorn have often said that Tesla’s energy business could one day rival its automotive business in size. The strategy here is to leverage Tesla’s battery know-how and scale (from making car batteries) into grid storage and home energy. This provides a more stable revenue source (energy contracts can have long-term orders) and helps even out the cyclicality of auto sales. It also aligns with Tesla’s mission of accelerating sustainable energy. By investing in more battery production (the Nevada Gigafactory expansion, a new cathode facility in Texas, etc.), Tesla is ensuring it has the capacity to grow both the car and energy sides. Analysts note that a booming energy segment could stabilize Tesla’s margins over time, since software and services can be layered on (e.g., Tesla’s Autobidder software that helps utilities manage energy storage) [147]. Tesla’s solar panel/roof business is also part of this division, though it’s been relatively quiet – solar installations are steady but not growing explosively. The bigger focus is on stationary battery packs, where Tesla sees huge global demand as grids transition to renewables.

Arguably the most exciting (and controversial) aspect of Tesla’s strategy is its focus on Artificial Intelligence and autonomous technology. Musk has famously said “Tesla is as much an AI company as it is a car company.” In practice, this means Tesla is pouring resources into its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, its Dojo supercomputer (a custom AI training computer to process video data from Tesla cars), and even AI robotics. In 2025, Tesla’s FSD Beta is still classified as a Level 2 driver assist (the human driver must remain attentive), but Musk insists they are inching towards higher autonomy. He recently hyped FSD version 14, hinting it might make cars feel “almost sentient” [148] – an exaggeration perhaps, but indicative of Tesla’s rapid software iterations. Tesla has a unique strategy of deploying beta self-driving features to hundreds of thousands of customers, collecting massive amounts of real-world driving data (over 7 billion miles driven on Autopilot/FSD to date) [149]. This data feeds Tesla’s AI models to improve the system. In mid-2025, Tesla even launched a pilot robotaxi service in Austin, Texas – essentially letting a small fleet of Model Ys with FSD give rides with no human driver, within a limited geo-fenced area [150]. While still very early (and with safety personnel overseeing), it marked one of the first attempts at a commercial driverless ride-hailing service by an automaker [151]. Tesla’s strategy contrasts with players like Waymo or Cruise, which use custom hardware and have limited operations; Tesla is betting it can achieve autonomy via consumer cars that double as robotaxis. Regulators remain cautious – no country yet allows full Level 5 autonomy at scale, and U.S. regulators (NHTSA) are investigating Tesla’s Autopilot safety in some contexts [152]. But Musk’s vision is that once the tech and regulatory pieces fall into place, Tesla could activate a vast robotaxi network, generating revenue from rides (think of Teslas earning money for owners while they’re not in use). This potential is a key part of Tesla’s long-term strategy and one reason some investors value it like a tech company.

Tesla is also exploring humanoid robots with its Optimus prototype, revealed in 2022 and updated in 2023. In 2025, Optimus is still in development, but Musk occasionally shows progress (videos of the robot walking, picking up objects). The strategy here is leveraging Tesla’s AI (vision, neural nets, actuators from car manufacturing) to eventually create robots for factory work or other tasks. It’s a moonshot project – not contributing to revenue now – but it underscores Tesla’s willingness to invest in futuristic tech that could pay off in the long run. Musk even said the humanoid robot market might become bigger than the car market someday. While that’s speculative, it’s clear Tesla wants to be at the forefront of AI-driven robotics, not just vehicles.

Finally, Tesla’s strategy involves heavy vertical integration and investment in manufacturing to support all the above. The company continues to expand its Gigafactories (a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico is planned, as well as expansion of the Nevada and Texas factories). It produces its own batteries (with Panasonic and others as partners) and is developing in-house battery chemistries (like 4680 cells) to improve range and reduce costs. Tesla’s ability to control much of its supply chain (from software down to many hardware components) is a strategic advantage that it’s carrying into new areas – for example, designing its own AI chips for self-driving (the FSD computer and Dojo chips) rather than relying on third parties. This integration often lets Tesla move faster or achieve better efficiency, though it also means it shoulders more of the upfront R&D costs.

In summary, Tesla’s strategic direction in late 2025 is a blend of offense and defense: offensively pushing into new realms like AI services, robotaxis, energy storage, and perhaps one day robots, while defensively cutting prices and expanding its product lineup to protect its EV lead against a growing pack of competitors. It’s a lot to juggle, and it explains why Tesla’s story is both exciting and, at times, concerning to investors. The company is effectively rewriting the playbook for what an automaker can be, aiming to be a renewable energy and technology powerhouse. Success in even a few of these domains could justify bulls’ optimism; stumbling in them could validate the skeptics. Tesla’s strategic bets will be critical to watch as we head into 2026 and beyond.

Competitive Landscape: Tesla vs. Automakers and Tech Rivals

Tesla’s rise has spurred virtually every automaker in the world to race toward electric vehicles, and that competition is now intensifying markedly. In 2025, Tesla still leads in many metrics – it’s often the top seller of EVs in markets like the U.S. and Europe, and it enjoys better profit margins on EVs than most peers – but the gap is closing.

U.S. competition: Legacy giants General Motors and Ford have rolled out high-profile EVs (e.g. Ford’s F-150 Lightning electric pickup, GM’s Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Bolt/Equinox EV, etc.). While none has matched Tesla’s sales yet, they are starting to nibble at various segments. However, these companies face their own challenges: in 2025 both GM and Ford saw slowing EV sales growth and even pulled back some targets, citing supply chain issues and weaker demand than expected. They also dealt with a major UAW labor strike in 2025, which disrupted production and could raise their labor costs, potentially affecting their EV rollouts. Tesla, notably, is not unionized and didn’t face that issue, which some analysts view as a competitive cost advantage (though it’s a point of contention socially). Rivian and Lucid, two U.S. EV startups, also compete in the high-end space. Rivian’s electric trucks/SUVs have gotten good reviews but are still produced in modest volumes (perhaps ~50k/year), and Lucid’s luxury sedans are niche and pricey. So in the U.S., Tesla’s main competition in 2025 is actually coming from future models promised by the big automakers (like Chevy’s ~$30k Equinox EV or Ford’s next-gen crossovers) rather than any one model beating Tesla’s Model 3/Y in sales right now. But Tesla’s U.S. market share in EVs has slipped from its near-monopoly a few years ago as more models enter – consumers can now choose a Mustang Mach-E, a Kia EV6, etc., whereas before Tesla was one of few options. This is partly why Tesla has been cutting prices in the U.S., to stay ahead of new entrants.

China competition: The fiercest EV battlefield is China, the world’s largest auto market. Here, Tesla faces dozens of competitors, from established players to startups, often with backing from tech giants or the government. The standout is BYD, which has become an EV powerhouse. BYD sells EVs (and plug-in hybrids) at a variety of price points – many models undercut Tesla on price in China, and BYD’s yearly sales (including hybrids) are on par with or higher than Tesla’s global sales. BYD is selling roughly 3 million vehicles annually (many of them in the affordable segment) [153] [154]. Tesla’s response has been to repeatedly cut prices in China on models like the Model Y, to the point where its cars have at times been cheaper in China than in the U.S. for identical configurations. Despite that, Tesla’s China sales have grown, but market share is tough to hold because domestic brands are so numerous (NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto, Geely’s Zeekr, SAIC’s brands, etc.). Chinese EV makers have also started expanding globally – for instance, BYD and NIO are entering Europe with compelling models. This is significant: Tesla’s rumored $25k car or the new Model Y Standard are essentially aimed at countering the BYD effect – i.e., the rise of sub-$30k electric cars that could flood markets worldwide [155] [156]. China was a strong point for Tesla in Q3 thanks to the refreshed Model Y and a localized strategy, but it’s a constant fight. The Chinese government’s policies also play a role: they had EV subsidies that were reduced in 2023, sparking a price war (which Tesla participated in). Now China’s economy has been a bit shaky (property market issues, etc.), so demand isn’t unlimited. Tesla navigates this by producing very efficiently at Giga Shanghai (which is one of Tesla’s most cost-efficient plants) and exporting some output to Europe and other Asian markets when Chinese demand softens.

Europe competition: Europe is a mature auto market with strong domestic brands, and they’ve aggressively pushed into EVs, partly due to EU emissions regulations. Companies like Volkswagen Group (VW, Audi, Porsche, etc.), BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis (Peugeot, Fiat, etc.), and newcomers like Hyundai/Kia (Korea) are all vying for European EV buyers. Europe also has several EV incentives and mandates (though some subsidies have been reduced recently [157]). Tesla’s market share in Europe has seen pressure: as noted, its share fell to around 1.5% in the EU for new car sales, after a sharp drop in its European deliveries in Q3 [158]. Part of that was the winding down of backlogged orders and increased local competition. Notably, European consumers have many choices under €30k that Tesla doesn’t match – e.g. the Renault Zoe, VW ID.3 (with subsidies), various smaller EVs, and even plug-in hybrids which remain popular (and Tesla doesn’t make any hybrids) [159] [160]. Additionally, some analysts speculate that Musk’s polarizing public persona (political comments on X, etc.) may have dented Tesla’s brand in parts of Europe, which is generally more climate-conscious and sometimes put off by controversy [161]. To fight back, Tesla opened a factory in Germany (Giga Berlin) to localize production of Model Y and eventually Model 3, which helps avoid import tariffs and improves delivery times. It also slashed prices in Europe multiple times in 2023–25. Still, as of late 2025, Tesla is facing an “EV price war” in Europe too, especially with a wave of Chinese-made EVs starting to hit Europe (brands like MG, BYD, NIO) and with European incumbents offering lease deals and incentives. Tesla’s new standard models and any future cheaper car will be crucial for Europe, where a significant chunk of the market is below €35k – a segment Tesla hasn’t played in until now.

Tech company competition: While no tech giant directly sells EVs yet (Apple’s long-rumored car is not out; Google’s Waymo is focusing on self-driving tech, not selling cars), Tesla often finds itself compared to or competing with tech firms in specific areas. For example, in autonomous driving, Waymo (Google) and Cruise (GM, but run like a tech startup) are rivals in creating robotaxi services. In 2023–2025, Waymo and Cruise began offering limited robo-taxi rides in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. However, they hit some roadblocks – for instance, in late 2023, Cruise’s permit was suspended in San Francisco after some safety incidents. Waymo is methodical but slow, expanding carefully. This actually made Tesla’s approach look better to some investors, because Tesla avoids the regulatory bottleneck by selling “self-driving” to consumers rather than operating public taxis (so far) [162] [163]. Apple is another potential competitor – while no Apple Car exists yet, the tech giant has poached Tesla engineers and reportedly aims to launch an autonomous EV later in the decade. If Apple or others succeed, Tesla would be competing on tech, brand, and ecosystem (imagine an Apple car integrated with iOS – Tesla would need to match that experience). In the energy space, Tesla’s competitors include battery makers and industrial firms (like LG, Panasonic – though Panasonic is also a partner – and energy storage firms like Fluence). But Tesla’s brand recognition in energy isn’t as strong as in cars, so it’s carving its niche with the Megapack which currently is selling as fast as they can make them.

Overall, the competitive landscape means Tesla can’t rest on its laurels. This is evident from its changing tactics: more frequent pricing adjustments (in 2023–25, Tesla cut prices globally dozens of times, something it rarely did before), actual marketing efforts (Tesla has started running ads for the first time in its history, albeit small-scale, and Musk said in 2023 they’d “try a little advertising”), and focus on cost-cutting to preserve margins while prices fall. It’s a new phase – for years Tesla demand outstripped supply; now supply is catching up industry-wide, and Tesla must compete for each sale. The good news for Tesla is that the overall EV market is growing – EVs are now ~15% of new car sales worldwide and climbing [164]. As the pie grows, Tesla can grow even if its slice gets a bit smaller percentage-wise. But Tesla’s lofty valuation is predicated on being a dominant leader, so the company is clearly fighting to retain an edge. Its scale (expected ~1.8 million+ deliveries in 2025), strong brand, and technology lead (especially in software and charging network) are advantages that competitors respect. In fact, Ford, GM, and others agreed in 2023–24 to adopt Tesla’s charging plug standard (NACS) for their EVs – effectively bowing to Tesla’s superior charging network. Moves like that indicate Tesla is still setting industry norms. Yet, competition will only intensify from here, so Tesla’s next steps – whether it’s launching that $25k car, continuing to cut prices, or innovating in autonomy – will be crucial to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field.

Macroeconomic and Policy Factors Influencing TSLA

While company-specific news often grabs headlines, broader macroeconomic trends and government policies play a big role in Tesla’s performance and valuation. Here are a few key factors as of late 2025:

Interest Rates and Economic Climate: After a period of high inflation and rapid interest rate hikes in 2022–2024, the macro backdrop in 2025 is at a turning point. High-growth stocks like Tesla are sensitive to interest rates because higher rates reduce the present value of future earnings (and Tesla’s valuation depends on big profits years from now). Throughout 2023 and into 2024, as central banks raised rates, growth stocks saw pressure. By October 2025, however, there’s a growing hope that the Federal Reserve is done hiking rates – and might even cut rates in 2026 if inflation continues to cool [165] [166]. This prospect has improved sentiment for tech and growth stocks broadly, Tesla included. Indeed, part of Tesla’s strong stock rebound in 2023–25 was due to a market-wide shift back into tech/growth as investors anticipated a peak in rates. Additionally, the U.S. economy showed resilience (no official recession through 2025, unemployment stayed relatively low), which meant consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars held up reasonably well. That said, borrowing costs are still much higher than a few years ago – auto loan rates in 2025 are significantly above those in 2020. For a company like Tesla that sells cars averaging $50k, high interest rates are a headwind because they make monthly payments more expensive for consumers. Tesla has addressed this by offering its own discounted financing deals (e.g. low APR promotions via Tesla Financing) to spur sales [167]. Going forward, if the economy stays solid or interest rates begin to ease, it’s a tailwind for Tesla – more affordable financing and a risk-on attitude in markets. Conversely, any economic downturn or credit crunch would quickly hit auto demand (cars are discretionary purchases for many) and could make investors less willing to pay high multiples for Tesla’s stock. So far, Tesla navigated the post-pandemic chip shortage and inflation period by cutting costs and prices to keep volume growing. It will continue to be influenced by macro trends like GDP growth, consumer confidence, and interest rate moves.

EV Tax Credits and Government Policy: Government incentives have been both a boon and a challenge for Tesla. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced generous EV tax credits, but with complex rules about manufacturing location and vehicle price caps. Tesla benefited initially – many Model 3/Y variants qualified for $7,500 credits in 2023 – which effectively made Teslas more affordable and boosted demand. However, as of Sept 30, 2025, most Tesla models lost eligibility for the $7,500 federal credit (due to hitting certain production volume limits and sourcing requirements) [168]. This led to the Q3 sales rush (as discussed) and now poses a headwind for Q4. The removal of incentives means Tesla has to stand on its own pricing, or find other ways to entice buyers (hence the Standard Range models). Notably, some competitors like GM and Ford still have vehicles that qualify for credits (though they too will phase out over time). In response, some automakers found ways to effectively extend incentives – e.g. by offering lease deals that pass on credits, or lobbying for rule tweaks [169]. Tesla’s strategy was to pre-emptively cut prices so that after credits expired, their cars wouldn’t suddenly seem too expensive. In Europe, EV subsidies have also been dialed back in major markets (Germany reduced EV purchase bonuses, for instance, especially for higher-priced cars – which hurt Tesla more than cheaper local models) [170]. China had a long-running EV subsidy program that ended in 2023, which triggered a price war among EV makers (including Tesla) to keep demand up [171] [172]. The policy backdrop is a bit two-sided: on one hand, global governments are pushing toward electrification (banning gas car sales after 2035 in some regions, emissions credits, etc.), which structurally benefits Tesla as an EV leader. On the other hand, as EVs go mainstream, governments are tapering direct financial support, which means Tesla will increasingly compete on level ground with other makers. Another policy angle: trade and tariffs. Tesla has managed to avoid some tariff issues by building factories locally (cars made in China for China, in Germany for Europe, etc.). But there are still sensitivities – e.g., if U.S.-China relations worsen, tariffs on components or materials could increase costs for Tesla (which uses minerals and battery components from various countries). The EU also launched an inquiry in 2023 into China’s subsidies for its EV industry, potentially leading to tariffs on Chinese-made EVs imported to Europe. If that happens, Tesla’s exports from Shanghai to Europe might be affected. So far, Tesla navigates these by localizing production (its approach is essentially to have a factory on each major continent to sidestep tariffs and shipping costs).

Consumer Income and Fuel Prices: Broader economic factors like inflation and fuel costs also influence Tesla. High inflation in essentials (food, rent) can squeeze consumers, leaving less disposable income to buy new cars. Tesla’s recent move to lower prices is partly recognition that a lot of potential buyers might be stretching their budgets. If inflation continues to moderate and wage growth picks up, that’s positive for auto demand. Gasoline prices are another interesting factor: historically, when gas prices spike, interest in EVs rises (as a cost-saving measure). In 2022, gas prices soared and Tesla had huge waitlists. In 2023–2025, gas has been volatile but generally not at extreme highs. If gas stays moderate or low, the economic incentive to switch to EVs is less urgent for some buyers (EVs still often save money on fuel, but the payback period lengthens when gas is cheap). However, many buy Teslas for performance/tech or environmental reasons, not purely fuel savings. Still, if oil prices jump (due to geopolitical events, etc.), it could give Tesla a demand boost. Conversely, if a recession hits and oil plunges, gas cars become cheaper to run and some cost-sensitive buyers might delay EV purchases. Global economic health matters too: Europe’s economy has been soft (with some countries near recession in 2024–25), which could partly explain Tesla’s sales slump there [173]. China’s economy has had issues (property sector crisis, slower growth) which could affect its rising middle class – a key demographic for Tesla in China [174]. Tesla, being a relatively premium product, needs healthy economies or at least healthy upper-middle-class consumers worldwide.

Tech Sector Sentiment (AI Narrative): Tesla’s stock often trades in tandem with the tech sector, especially anything related to AI. 2023–2024 saw a massive boom in AI-related stocks (Nvidia, etc.) on the promise of generative AI. While Tesla isn’t an AI chip provider, it has positioned itself as an AI-driven company (with autonomous driving, the Dojo supercomputer, etc.). This means at times Tesla benefits from the general “AI hype” – investors lump it in with tech names that could exploit AI advances [175]. If tech stocks are in favor, Tesla often rides that wave; if there’s a tech pullback, Tesla can be dragged down even if its auto business is fine. For instance, if there’s disappointment in the pace of self-driving adoption (say, a competitor has a setback or there’s a regulatory crackdown on AI vehicles), that could cool investor enthusiasm for Tesla’s lofty autonomy promises [176]. On the other hand, wins in tech – like if Tesla demonstrates a big breakthrough in FSD or if Dojo allows some leap in AI training – could further bolster the narrative that Tesla is a cutting-edge AI company, not just a carmaker, and thus deserves a high valuation. Also, stock market liquidity and risk appetite in general matter: when the market is in a “risk-on” mode (often due to macro factors like easing rates or positive growth), high-beta stocks like TSLA tend to outperform. When fear rises (e.g. during banking scares or geopolitical crises), those stocks can swing harder to the downside.

In summary, Tesla’s fate is not only tied to its own execution and innovation, but also to these macro and policy currents. The near-term removal of U.S. tax credits is a challenge that Tesla is trying to meet with pricing adjustments. The potential for lower interest rates is a silver lining that could support its high valuation. Competition, partially spurred by policy (like emissions rules forcing others to go EV), is a constant factor that interacts with macro conditions (e.g. if a rival struggles financially in a downturn, that could slow their EV push, indirectly aiding Tesla). And overarching it all, Tesla’s status as a market darling means it will likely continue to react to broad market sentiment about growth stocks and technology. Investors in Tesla thus keep one eye on Musk’s tweets and delivery numbers, and another on Fed statements and government EV announcements.

Elon Musk’s Influence and Next Moves

It’s impossible to discuss Tesla without considering Elon Musk, the company’s CEO and figurehead. Musk’s influence on Tesla is profound – he’s often described as both Tesla’s greatest asset and a potential liability, depending on the context [177].

On the positive side, Musk is the visionary force driving Tesla’s ambition. He has led Tesla from its startup days (selling a few thousand Roadsters) to a global enterprise delivering nearly 2 million cars a year [178]. His bold vision for a sustainable future – electric cars, solar energy, interplanetary travel (via SpaceX) – has inspired an almost fanatical customer and investor following. This Musk factor has tangible benefits: Tesla spends almost nothing on traditional advertising, yet Musk’s ability to generate buzz (through product unveilings, tweets, media appearances) serves as a constant stream of publicity [179]. For example, the cryptic tweets about the Oct 7 event garnered tens of millions of views on X (Twitter) [180], creating hype that no conventional marketing campaign could match. When Tesla’s stock soared 5% in a day recently, Musk’s personal net worth jumped accordingly, reaching about $465 billion (making him by far the richest person alive) [181]. In late 2025, he even briefly surpassed a $500 billion net worth – the first person ever to do so – thanks to Tesla’s stock rally [182]. Musk’s wealth is essentially tied to Tesla’s success, aligning his interests with shareholders in a big way.

Recognizing Musk’s centrality, Tesla’s board has moved to secure his commitment long-term. In 2025, Tesla proposed a massive new CEO performance award for Musk – potentially granting him ~12% of Tesla’s shares (worth up to $1 trillion) if he meets extremely ambitious targets over the next 10 years [183]. Those targets include Tesla achieving a $10+ trillion market cap and producing 20 million cars per year by around 2035 [184]. For perspective, 20 million cars is more than 10× Tesla’s current annual volume, and $10T market cap would be roughly 5× the combined value of Apple and Saudi Aramco today – truly heroic goals. The logic, as the board sees it, is that Musk responded brilliantly to a similar 2018 incentive plan (which had lower but still huge targets that Tesla met, skyrocketing the stock and earning Musk tens of billions). So, they want to “challenge him to do it again” [185]. Shareholders will have to approve this plan, but it underscores a key point: keeping Musk at Tesla’s helm is considered critical. Musk has a lot on his plate – he also runs SpaceX, he acquired and runs X (Twitter) as of 2022, and has other ventures (Neuralink, The Boring Company). Investors have at times been nervous that Musk might get distracted or even eventually leave Tesla. This new compensation package is designed to keep him focused on Tesla through the coming decade [186] [187].

However, Musk’s influence is a double-edged sword. His unfiltered communication style and forays into controversy can and have had repercussions for Tesla. In recent years, Musk has been very active on social media (X/Twitter), often wading into political and social debates that are unrelated to Tesla’s core business [188]. He has taken stances or made comments about topics like COVID-19 responses, gender pronouns, politics, and more. While some of his followers appreciate his candor, these actions alienated certain groups of consumers – notably more liberal, environmentally conscious people who were once core to Tesla’s early adopter base [189]. Reuters reported that Tesla insiders saw Musk’s polarizing political comments as having “at times hurt Tesla’s brand perception,” particularly among those left-leaning customers [190]. For instance, in 2022–2023 after Musk took over Twitter (and espoused some right-leaning views), there were anecdotal reports of some customers canceling Tesla orders, and competitors like GM even cited Tesla’s brand “baggage” as an opportunity for them. Musk himself has acknowledged that his tweets can be “a distraction” but often insists he won’t “divorce” his public persona from his business – it’s all the same to him. This creates a delicate dynamic: Musk’s celebrity and online presence keep Tesla in the news constantly (mostly for free), but if he veers into highly divisive territory, it can create reputational risks and potentially soften sales in some markets [191] [192]. So far, Tesla’s sales are at record highs, indicating that product appeal wins out over controversy for many buyers, but it’s something both the company and investors monitor closely.

Another concern was Musk’s bandwidth. In late 2022 into 2023, when Musk was consumed with running Twitter (after buying it and making sweeping changes), Tesla’s stock fell sharply, partly on fears that Musk was “AWOL” from Tesla or selling Tesla shares to fund Twitter. By mid-2023, Musk hired a CEO for X (Linda Yaccarino) and publicly stated he’d refocus on Tesla, which helped reassure investors [193]. This episode showed that Musk’s personal actions (even outside Tesla) can materially impact Tesla’s stock – a rare level of key-man risk. It appears Musk has since balanced his time better, but the “Musk overhang” (the risk of him getting distracted or selling shares) is an ongoing consideration.

On the strategy front, Musk’s bold promises both inspire and sometimes frustrate. He often sets extremely aggressive goals – like fully self-driving cars by year X (a moving target he’s pushed out repeatedly), or huge production ramps that end up delayed. Critics argue Musk’s overpromising could land Tesla in hot water – for example, regulators have probed whether Tesla’s marketing of “Full Self-Driving” is misleading since the feature is not actually autonomous yet [194] [195]. There have been investigations and even lawsuits related to accidents involving Autopilot, putting scrutiny on Musk’s claims. Yet, one has to note that Musk’s high-risk, high-reward approach has often paid off in the end. Tesla’s Model 3 ramp in 2017–2018 famously went through “production hell” – Musk set near-impossible production targets, missed deadlines, slept at the factory, but eventually succeeded in mass-producing the Model 3 and effectively transforming Tesla into a mainstream automaker. This pattern of “aim ridiculously high, sometimes fall short initially but eventually achieve something significant” has earned Musk credibility with a lot of investors and fans. It’s why many are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on ambitious projects like robotaxis or humanoid robots – Musk has defied the skeptics before. Still, it also means Tesla’s journey can be bumpy, with delays and flashbacks of chaos that have to be managed.

Importantly, Musk is essentially the face of Tesla. Unlike GM or Toyota, where the average person might not know the CEO’s name, Musk is a celebrity CEO. This personal branding entwines with Tesla’s brand. It gives Tesla a certain edge – customers often feel like they’re part of Musk’s mission when they buy a Tesla – but it also means any misstep by Musk (personal or professional) can directly affect Tesla’s public image. If, hypothetically, Musk had to step away (due to health or other reasons) or shifted focus drastically, it could rattle Tesla’s stock and perhaps the company’s direction. This “key man risk” is something analysts mention – Tesla without Musk is hard to imagine for many, which is why the board’s huge incentive is aimed at keeping him engaged [196] [197].

As for Musk’s next moves: in the near term, he appears laser-focused on Tesla’s product roadmap and expansion. He’s been hyping the upcoming Cybertruck deliveries, the next FSD update, and this recent affordable model launch – indicating he’s very much in Tesla CEO mode right now. The new compensation plan, if approved, also suggests he’s locking in to try to make Tesla not just a trillion-dollar company but potentially the biggest company in the world by far. Musk also continues to push the envelope on Tesla’s culture of innovation – hosting AI Day events, encouraging big engineering bets, etc. One “next move” to watch is how Musk handles the balance between growth and profit. Tesla’s price cuts have dented margins; investors will listen intently if Musk addresses at what point he’s aiming to stabilize prices or if he’s willing to sacrifice short-term profit for longer-term dominance. Additionally, Musk’s influence will likely be critical in navigating regulatory relations – for instance, how Tesla deals with safety regulators on self-driving, or how it participates in policy discussions (Musk has recently engaged more with Washington D.C., attending EV industry meetings and advocating against too much regulatory overreach on self-driving).

In conclusion, Elon Musk remains a central figure in Tesla’s narrative. His vision and leadership have been key to Tesla’s success, and recent actions (teasing new models, aligning a huge personal incentive with Tesla’s future growth) reassure many that he’s all-in on Tesla’s mission at this point [198]. At the same time, Musk’s unpredictability – whether in tweeting or taking on side ventures – injects an element of risk. The company’s challenge (and perhaps advantage) is to harness Musk’s brilliance and charisma, while minimizing the turbulence that sometimes comes with it. As Tesla embarks on the next chapter (mass market cars, AI, expansion in a competitive landscape), Musk’s role will undoubtedly continue to be a major asset, as long as he can balance his audacious goals with effective execution and avoid unnecessary controversies. Tesla’s brand is in many ways Musk’s brand of innovation and audacity. How that brand evolves – staying edgy and exciting but not alienating – will be a key storyline as Tesla drives forward under Musk’s guidance.

Outlook: The Road Ahead for Tesla

As of October 11, 2025, Tesla stands at an important inflection point. The company has immense momentum – record sales, a soaring stock, and new product lines – but also sky-high expectations to live up to. In the coming months, several factors will determine how Tesla’s story unfolds:

Financial Performance: Tesla will report its full Q3 2025 earnings (including profits and margins) and perhaps give hints about Q4. Investors will watch if Tesla’s aggressive pricing hurt its margins or if cost efficiencies (and the energy business boost) helped offset that. Guidance on Q4 deliveries (if provided around Oct 18 or in investor calls) will be crucial. Any indication of a significant post-incentive drop in demand could spook the market, whereas signs that orders remain robust (maybe helped by the new Standard models) would reassure that Tesla can grow even without tax credits. Tesla’s ability to manage costs – through things like cheaper battery designs, simplified manufacturing (single-piece castings, etc.) – will be key to maintaining profitability as they chase volume.

Product Deliveries and Innovation: The much-anticipated Cybertruck launch is slated around late 2025. The success of the Cybertruck’s ramp (can Tesla produce them in volume and with good quality?) will be closely watched. It’s a test of Tesla’s ability to tackle new segments and could open up a new profit stream if truck buyers flock to it – or be a drag if production is too slow or costs too high. Meanwhile, incremental improvements to existing models (like rumored Model 3 “Highland” and Model Y “Juniper” facelifts) can refresh demand. On the innovation front, Full Self-Driving technology progress remains a wild card – a major breakthrough or regulatory approval for robotaxis could massively boost Tesla’s value proposition, while setbacks could reinforce critics’ view that autonomy is always “just around the corner.” Musk’s promise that Tesla vehicles will achieve truly driverless operation has yet to fully materialize; if 2026 is proclaimed (yet again) as the year for robotaxis, investors may react with either excitement or skepticism depending on credibility.

Market Expansion: Tesla is constructing new factories (Mexico is planned to host a next-gen vehicle platform factory). How quickly Tesla can expand capacity and into which markets will influence growth. If Tesla announces concrete plans for an actual $25k car launch (the oft-mentioned “Model 2”), it would be a game-changer for outlook – but also could raise questions about margin impact and cannibalization. Internationally, India has been a market Tesla talks about (Musk met India’s PM about possible investment), and further expansion in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or Eastern Europe could be on the horizon. Each new market could add sales, but Tesla will face local challengers too.

Competition & EV Industry Health: The competitive landscape will heat up further in 2026–2027 with many new EV models coming. For Tesla’s outlook, a key factor will be how well its competitors execute. If traditional automakers continue to struggle with EV profitability or scaling (as some have in 2025), Tesla can keep gaining share. But if a competitor hits a home run – say, an extremely compelling $30k EV with high range or a superior autonomous system – that could pressure Tesla’s growth or pricing power. Additionally, the overall EV adoption rate matters. We’re at ~15% global new sales being EVs, projected to grow each year. If that growth accelerates (due to climate policies or consumer preference), Tesla benefits as a leader. If it stalls (perhaps due to economic factors or insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions), Tesla’s growth could moderate.

Macro and Policy Environment: As discussed, if interest rates come down in 2026, it could be a tailwind for Tesla’s stock and for auto sales. Conversely, if inflation resurges or a recession hits, Tesla might face a tougher environment of slackening demand. Policy-wise, new government actions like the EU possibly imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs (which could help Tesla’s pricing in Europe) or the US potentially reinstating some incentives (for cheaper EVs or batteries) could influence Tesla’s outlook. Also, environmental regulations like stricter emissions targets effectively force the market toward EVs by mandate, which is a tailwind for Tesla relative to any laggards that still rely on combustion vehicles.

Investor Sentiment and Valuation: Tesla’s current valuation assumes a lot of future success. To maintain a $1.5T+ market cap, Tesla will need to execute nearly flawlessly or spring positive surprises. Any sign of growth significantly slowing (e.g., dropping to single-digit percentage growth without a clear re-acceleration plan) could prompt a valuation reset. On the other hand, Tesla has often surprised to the upside – whether it’s delivering cars faster than expected or opening new revenue streams (like selling software upgrades). Investors will be looking for new revenue streams in coming years: perhaps a launch of a Tesla Network (ride-hailing) if robotaxis become viable, or growth in energy revenue as Megapack factories expand, or even monetizing things like insurance and services better. These could bolster the outlook beyond just car unit sales.

In essence, Tesla’s outlook is bright but challenging. The company sits as the leader of an EV revolution it helped spark, with tailwinds like technological leadership and a strong brand, but it’s now navigating a more crowded highway with many others chasing it. The next year will test Tesla’s ability to keep scaling rapidly while defending profitability – a balancing act that will influence whether TSLA stock continues its upward trajectory or takes a pit stop.

For the public and investors, Tesla remains a captivating story: a company at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and automotive history. The coming quarters will reveal whether Tesla can continue defying odds and justifying the hype, or whether it will face a phase of growing pains as the EV competition catches up. Given its track record, few would want to bet outright against Tesla, but the company certainly has to prove itself anew in this next chapter. In any case, Tesla’s journey ahead promises to be closely watched, full of innovation, and undoubtedly, not a smooth ride – just the way Elon Musk likes it.

China is leading the world in renewable energy. Not only does it generate more of it than any other nation, it is also exporting its clean energy technology to other countries at a furious pace. This week the New York Times published two reports about renewables in China that explain how that country is making all this happen and point out that there are costs to China’s push for renewables that seldom get reported.

162 Square Miles Of Solar Panels

Last month, China President Xi Jinping told the United Nations his country would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its economy and would expand renewable energy sixfold in coming years. The New York Times called it “a moment of global significance for the nation that is currently the world’s biggest polluter.”

China is an enormous country. 90 percent of its people live in the eastern part of the country, where sunshine is muted and winds are normally too slow to power turbines reliably. The western part of China is just the opposite. It has abundant sunshine, wind, and rushing rivers, all of which are ideal for making renewable electricity. But it is a thousand miles or more from China’s densely populated cities. More about that later.

China has made a portion of Tibet into a center for its clean energy plans. In an area that includes mountains and plateaus, it has constructed a 162-square-mile renewable energy development. 10,000 feet high, solar panels stretch from horizon to horizon across an area 7 times larger than Manhattan.

Because the air at that elevation is so clear, those panels are bathed in bright sunshine. Cooler temperatures also help maximize the output from the panels. There are also dozens of wind turbines that spin in the evening breezes just as the sun begins to set. A number of dams on Tibet’s fast flowing rivers add hydropower to the clean energy mix.

The primary group of solar farms, known as the Talatan Solar Park, dwarfs every other cluster of solar farms in the world. It covers 162 square miles in Gonghe County, an alpine desert in the sparsely inhabited Qinghai province in western China. The primary objective for building such massive clean energy facilities is to uncouple China from its dependence on imported fossil fuels — coal, oil, and LNG.

Renewable energy helps China power 30,000 miles of high-speed train routes and its growing fleet of electric cars. At the same time, cheap electricity enables China to manufacture even more solar panels, which dominate global markets and power artificial intelligence data centers, Times reporter Keith Bradsher wrote.

The Talatan solar project provides a massive 16,930 megawatts of power and is still expanding. Within three years, it will grow to be 10 times the size of Manhattan. The wind turbines nearby contribute another 4,700 megawatts of power, and hydroelectric dams nearby contribute another 7,380 megawatts.

To put that into perspective, at the turn of the century, China built the Three Gorges Dam — the largest hydroelectric project in the country’s history. Today, Bradsher reports, it adds enough solar panels to match the output from the Three Gorges Dam every three weeks.

Clean Energy Attracts Industry

Two pumped hydro projects are under construction in the mountains near the Talatan Solar Park. They will use excess solar power generated during the day to pump water up to reservoirs several miles high. At night, the water will flow back downhill to power turbines.

The prospect of inexpensive electricity is attracting new industries to the area. Some will use that electricity to turn quartzite into polysilicon for solar panels. Others want that electricity to power data centers. Those data centers will consume 40 percent less electricity because air conditioning is hardly needed to cool the computers at such high altitudes, where average temperatures are lower than near the coast. Air warmed by the data centers will be circulated through underground pipes to heat other buildings in the area, replacing coal-fired boilers in the process.

China has leveraged smart ideas to address the issue of having too much renewable energy at some times. The pumped hydro facilities will take care of that. They also are taking advantage of nature to reduce the demand for electricity in data centers, while abundant clean energy is being put to good use to manufacture more clean energy resources. If all this sounds too good to be true, perhaps it is.

China & HVDC Transmission

China has massive amounts of clean energy in its western provinces, but only 10 percent of its people live there. The demand for all those lovely electrons is in the coastal areas in the south and east. That is also where much of its industry is located. How does it get the electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed?

It will come as no surprise that China, with its penchant for detailed planning, has considered that problem and come up with a solution. Times reporter Keith Bradsher filed a companion story this week that focuses on the country’s massive network of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines and it reveals that there may be an ugly downside to clean energy miracle taking place in China.

“In China, the longest ultra high voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City,” Bradsher wrote. China has 41 high-voltage DC transmission lines with more in the works.

Many of China’s ultra-high-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries. According to data from the end of last year, the most recent data available publicly, 19 transmission lines operate at 800 kilovolts (800,000 volts). Another 22 operate at 1,000 kilovolts (1 million volts) and one uses 1,100 kilovolts.

That is some serious power. Those transmission lines use massive pylons that march across the landscape like Martian war machines. We don’t hear much about ordinary Chinese citizens complaining about government polities — NIMBY is not much of an issue, in other words. But those power lines have an impact on those who live and work near them.

A million volts overhead can lead to some powerful effects on people and structures nearby. Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, told Bradasher he has concerns about those transmission lines.

“When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.” Oooh, that doesn’t sound good!

The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by. He said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.” That is as close to NIMBY as you are likely to get in China today.

But despite the downsides, there is little question renewable energy has had a powerful impact on life in China. After the disaster at Fukushima in 2011, China abruptly cancelled plans to build more nuclear reactors and transitioned to building up its renewable energy capabilities.

The construction of ultra-high-voltage power lines has helped China reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the toxic air pollution that once blanketed its most industrialized regions. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data in August found that air pollution in China had declined by 41 percent since 2014 — adding almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

The UC Air Quality Life Index says: “Air pollution is the greatest external threat to human life expectancy on the planet. The AQLI’s latest 2023 data reveals that permanently reducing global PM₂.₅ air pollution to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline would add years onto average human life expectancy — or a combined 15.1 billion life years saved. The impact of PM₂.₅ on global life expectancy is comparable to that of smoking, more than 4 times that of high alcohol use, more than 5 times that of transport injuries like car crashes, and more than 6 times that of HIV/AIDS.”

In light of those benefits, a few sparks from your umbrella when it rains might be acceptable. We often speak of renewable energy in terms of how many homes it can power or how many jobs it will add to the local economy. Seldom do we address the benefits of breathing cleaner air. Perhaps renewable energy advocates should emphasize that part to the equation more forcefully.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Talatan-Solar-Park.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:49.146987

On June 25, 2024, the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC) approved a pilot policy intending to enable data centers to directly procure renewable energy through Direct Power Purchase Agreements (Direct PPAs), facilitated by Third Party Access (TPA) through the national grid for up to 2,000 MW. Please also refer to Hunton’s client alert published back in September 2024 when the Direct PPA and the TPA Code were introduced, the client alert can be accessed here.

The initiative is being jointly implemented by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO), Board of Investment Thailand (BOI), and the governmental utility operators, i.e., the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).

On October 3, 2025, 16 months after the NEPC’s approval of the Direct PPAs pilot policy, the ERC finally released draft regulations on the Direct PPAs (Draft Direct PPA Regulation) and the draft TPA Code. While the release of both drafts represent important steps in market reform in Thailand, our current focus is on the Draft Direct PPA Regulation.

It is important to note that the Draft Direct PPA Regulation and the draft TPA Code are currently in draft forms and remain subject to revision through the public hearing and legislative processes. Stakeholders should be aware that the provisions outlined here may evolve as part of ongoing regulatory consultations.

Purpose and Policy Intent

According to BOI data published on March 17, 2025, between 2022 and 2024, 27 projects in data centers and cloud services applied for investment promotion, representing a combined investment value of over THB 290 billion.

This increase reflects Thailand’s strategic positioning as a regional hub for digital infrastructure and its commitment to enabling large-scale, sustainable operations through regulatory and energy market reforms. In addition, according to Krungsri Bank’s Industry Outlook 2025–2027: Data Center Industry, the total revenue of Thailand’s data center industry is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.5–8.5%.

With the industry predicting substantial growth, data center operators are scrambling to secure energy at competitive prices, especially renewable energy that will also help them align with various ESG goals. As part of Thailand’s ongoing efforts to support the development of the data center ecosystem in the country, Thailand continues to refine various laws and regulations to align with the country’s strategic objective to position the country as a regional hub for digital infrastructure. Thailand’s policy movements on the energy front not only facilitate individual project development but also contribute to the broader ecosystem necessary for sustainable growth in this sector.

The implementation of the pilot framework is designed to support BOI-promoted data centers in meeting global sustainability mandates by allowing the data centers to sign direct power purchase agreements to quickly procure renewable energy throughout the country. As such, companies producing renewable energy will be able to supply power to data centers via Thailand’s national grid, promoting market liberalization and competition in Thailand’s energy industry.

At a Glance: Contractual Structure for Direct PPA Scheme

The chart below illustrates contractual structure under the Direct PPA scheme as contemplated by the Draft Direct PPA Regulation.

1. Qualification of the Power Producer and Power Plant

Power producers must only use renewable energy sources. Based on our discussion with an ERC officer, a combination of renewable energy sources with battery energy storage system is permissible. The power plant must be a newly established generating facility without any pre-existing PPAs whether with a private offtaker or a governmental utility operator.

Each generating facility must have an installed capacity of at least 1,000 kVA and must have successfully secured a feeder capacity check by the governmental utility operator.

There are no restrictions on foreign ownership; however, foreign investors must ensure compliance with the Thailand’s Land Code, which generally prohibits foreigners (including a foreign majority-owned Thai company) from owning plots of land. However, if a foreign investor receives BOI promotion, land ownership may be permitted if it has been approved by the BOI.

Based on the draft TPA Connection Code, if the installed capacity of the generating facility is at least 6 MW, the generating facility must pass a system study conducted by EGAT.

2. Qualification of the Data Center

The eligible data center must be owned and operated by an entity that:

Receives an investment promotion by the BOI for its data center project (which includes server colocation and data hosting services.

Intends to utilize renewable energy for 100 percent of its power demand.

Is mandated by its group to use renewable energy and to align with its investments in other jurisdictions.

Has a minimum IT base load of 50 MW per building and submits a comprehensive ten-year electricity plan detailing proposed Direct PPAs, grid usage, and total load projections.

Has not yet generated income from such data center project as at the date on which it submits an application to ERC for the Direct PPAs quota.

Has secured a backup supply contract with the relevant governmental utility operator to provide backup supply during off-peak periods or times of excess demand.

Has developed a work plan and obtained a commitment from a power producer to utilize this Direct PPA regime. From our discussion with ERC officers, the commitment could be in the form of a non-binding MOU or LOI, where the relevant power producer expresses intention to sell electricity to the data center through the TPA and a Direct PPA.

3. Other Key Conditions and Compliance

Power producers must comply with both the governmental utility operator’s Grid Code and the TPA Code.

Power producers are required to enter into grid service agreements for the full Direct PPA capacity within specified timelines. If they fail to do so, the data center will be forfeited of any unused Direct PPA quota.

A single data center may be supplied by multiple power producers.

No specific form of Direct PPA is prescribed by the ERC; it is subject to commercial terms and negotiations between the power producers and the data center. A data center may be considered a “large scale customer” and therefore the power purchaser agreements must at least contain provisions related to rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to the ERC Notification on Standards of Contracts on Power Service Provision for Large Power Users B.E. 2561 (2018).

The grid service agreement between the power producer and utility must follow the format provided under the TPA Code.

Implications and Future Prospect

For data centers, it facilitates compliance with global renewable energy mandates while strengthening sustainability credentials.

Renewable energy producers benefit from expanded market opportunities, reducing dependence on government-backed PPAs.

Governmental utilities operators must prepare for the operational demands of wheeling services and system balancing under TPA Code.

An expert at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), a leading policy think tank, notes that clean energy is critical for global trade competitiveness. While the current ERC regulation limits Direct PPAs to data centers, the introduction of the TPA Code creates a pathway for expanding this scheme to other industries aiming for carbon neutrality and Net Zero. This evolution could strengthen Thailand’s export potential and overall competitiveness.

Next Steps

Stakeholders are encouraged to review the Draft Direct PPAs Regulation and TPA Code, and prepare for compliance and implementation.

It is anticipated that government agencies, such as ERC, BOI and the governmental utility operators, will issue further guidance as the pilot project advances, prescribing criteria, procedures, and conditions.

He was participating in the Ministerial Panel at the High-Level Dialogue on ‘Transforming our Urban Environment: Pathways to Sustainability’, on the sidelines of the IUCN World Conservation Congress, 2025 at Abu Dhabi.

Union MoS (Environment, Forest and Climate Change), Shri Kirti Vardhan Singh today shared India’s vision for sustainable, nature-positive urban development that puts people and planet at the center. He was participating in the Ministerial Panel at the High-Level Dialogue on ‘Transforming our Urban Environment: Pathways to Sustainability’, on the sidelines of the IUCN World Conservation Congress, 2025 at Abu Dhabi.

Shri Singh informed that India’s efforts to foster carbon markets and promote renewable energy generation are a step towards achieving the clarion call of ‘Mission LiFE’ given by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, which serves as a guiding principle for sustainability initiatives across the globe. The Government of India’s approach emphasises integrated planning, scalable missions, and citizen-centric behavioural change, he stated.

Flagship initiatives such as the Smart Cities Mission mainstream energy efficiency, renewable integration, sustainable mobility, and resilient infrastructure. The Minister informed about the Government providing support to India’s cities through three key pillars, that are:

Enabling frameworks and standards for green buildings, energy codes, and municipal finance.

Financing and risk-sharing being advanced through central grants, targeted viability-gap funding, and ongoing efforts to expand the city’s access to municipal bond markets, including green bonds.

Capacity-building and knowledge systems including training, data platforms, and model projects under Smart Cities, AMRUT, and urban-planning reforms.

Shri Singh noted that with the right vision, finance, and citizen engagement, urbanisation can become a powerful driver of low-carbon, inclusive development. India has adopted a holistic approach combining policy support, targeted schemes, and financial incentives. He talked about some of India’s National programmes such as:

The Smart Cities Mission, covering 100 cities, blends central funding with local planning to roll out smart street-lighting, rooftop solar, and building-energy management systems — reducing electricity use while improving urban services. Energy-Efficient Building Codes guide cities in ensuring new construction is climate-friendly.

The Energy Conservation Act, amended in 2022, strengthens energy-efficiency standards for buildings, appliances, and industries, and enables the establishment of a domestic carbon-credit market that rewards cities and businesses for reducing their energy footprint.

The AMRUT programme has enabled municipalities to upgrade to energy-efficient water-supply and pumping systems, lowering both costs and energy demand.

Looking ahead, Shri Singh said, the role of national governments is to provide stable policy frameworks that support cities in updating their bylaws and development regulations. They must work to expand access to innovative finance and deepen technology partnerships.

This, in turn, would encourage compact, transit-oriented, and energy-efficient urban growth. With such support, cities can advance faster toward energy-efficient, low-emission, and climate-resilient pathways that benefit their citizens and the planet.

As the countries of Global South including India are urbanizing rapidly, our goal must be to create cities that are livable, green, and inclusive — places where aspirations can thrive without losing the human touch, the Minister concluded.

Among them, photovoltaic panels will receive special treatment due to their high presence in the territory and their particular composition.
In addition, the facility will partially operate with solar energy, using panels on its roofs to self-supply part of its electrical consumption.
Recycling the sun: a new stage for clean energy The rise of solar energy in Chile has left a visible mark.
In the future, the recovery of solar panels could even fuel new production lines of more efficient modules, closing the loop of the solar economy.","In the heart of the Atacama desert, where the sun shines more than 300 days a year, an innovation is being prepared that aims to close the cycle of clean energy. The regional company Amffal announced the construction of the first industrial plant in Chile dedicated to the recycling of solar panels.

This step places the country at the forefront of sustainable management of electronic waste, at a key moment: the imminent entry into force of the Extended Producer Responsibility Law (REP Law), which will require companies to take responsibility for the electrical and electronic devices they place on the market. Among them, photovoltaic panels will receive special treatment due to their high presence in the territory and their particular composition.

Amffal, with more than three decades of experience in environmental management, plans to invest three million dollars in the project. The plant will be located on a two-hectare site in the Atacama Region and is expected to begin operations in 2026. With the capacity to process 345,000 solar modules per year, this infrastructure will mark a milestone in the Chilean circular economy.

In addition, the facility will partially operate with solar energy, using panels on its roofs to self-supply part of its electrical consumption. This model of self-sustainability reinforces Amffal’s commitment to energy transition and the reduction of emissions associated with waste treatment.

Recycling the sun: a new stage for clean energy

The rise of solar energy in Chile has left a visible mark. In the last 15 years, the country has multiplied its photovoltaic capacity, becoming one of the regional leaders in renewable generation. However, with the lifespan of panels estimated between 25 and 30 years, the first installed equipment is already approaching its operational end.

This change poses a new environmental challenge: what to do with the thousands of tons of solar panels that will cease to function? The answer lies in recycling. Each photovoltaic module can recover up to 90% of its components, mainly glass (74%) and aluminum (10%), as well as silicon and copper. These materials can be reintegrated into production chains, reducing the extraction of natural resources.

However, the panels also contain traces of heavy metals, such as cadmium, which require specialized treatment. Therefore, Amffal’s plant will incorporate separation and decontamination systems to avoid environmental impacts and ensure safe handling of all waste.

Beyond waste management, solar panel recycling represents a strategic opportunity. It allows the recovery of valuable raw materials, promotes green jobs, and reduces dependency on metal imports. Additionally, it strengthens public confidence in renewable energy, demonstrating that its development can be truly sustainable from start to finish.

Why and for what purpose are solar panels recycled?

Photovoltaic recycling fulfills three fundamental purposes: environmental, economic, and social. Firstly, it prevents tons of glass, plastic, and metals from ending up in landfills or contaminating the soil. Solar modules, being large and long-lasting products, require complex disposal processes; recycling them significantly reduces their ecological impact.

Secondly, this process allows for the recovery of strategic materials. Recycled silicon, aluminum, and copper retain much of their original quality, which decreases the need for new mining extractions and reduces the energy costs associated with producing virgin raw materials.

Finally, recycling fosters the creation of a sustainable industrial chain, generating local employment in solar regions like Atacama, where much of the country’s energy infrastructure is concentrated. It also contributes to technological innovation, driving the development of more efficient machinery and methods for waste recovery.

In the future, the recovery of solar panels could even fuel new production lines of more efficient modules, closing the loop of the solar economy.

A circular management model from Atacama

Amffal, whose headquarters are located in Copiapó, has built its trajectory by combining innovation with territorial commitment. In addition to the photovoltaic plant, the company is advancing in a pyrolysis facility for end-of-life tires, aimed at converting them into fuels and reusable materials. Both initiatives aim to address critical environmental liabilities in Chile and anticipate the goals of the REP Law.

With a processing capacity of 13,800 tons of solar panels annually, the project not only responds to a regulatory need but also consolidates a cultural shift: moving from a discard economy to a regenerative economy.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/10/reciclaje-solar.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-11 23:58:57.287276

The DOE could invest another $92 million over four years in the FIRE Collaboratives. The INFUSE projects selected each earned $100,000 to $500,000 for research in materials science, laser technology development, high-temperature superconducting magnet assessment, and artificial intelligence learning for fusion modeling and simulation.

One expert told ICN that the total outlay is not much considering the technical and cost challenges of fusion energy development. The outlet noted that building fission reactors requires complex, time-consuming regulatory and safety steps, and that the process would be similar for fusion reactors.

But it may be decades before the technology is realized. Fusion power mimics what happens in the sun, combining nuclei instead of splitting atoms. The problem is that researchers have been unable to maintain or contain a reaction. The massive amounts of energy it takes to get to that step also make it impractical — for now, at least.

""Nuclear development, ​​whether it's fission or fusion, requires a level of seriousness that I think is just not present in most of these projects right now,"" Edwin Lyman, the aforementioned expert and director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ICN.

The potential for nearly limitless clean power, however, has enthralled scientists for decades. Fusion power could usher in an era of resource efficiency, potentially eliminating electricity bills for individuals, businesses, and cities. And because it doesn't produce the long-lasting radioactive waste that fission does, it would be a better choice for the warming world. A planetwide transition from dirty energy sources to renewable energy ones is necessary to reduce the production of heat-trapping gases that harm human health, and the cleaner these alternatives are, the better.

The Trump administration wants to quadruple the United States' nuclear power production by 2050, ICN pointed out. It has gone the other way with many other renewable energy projects, including stopping construction of the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and canceling incentives for homeowners to install solar panels earlier than expected.

Most vehicles depreciate over time, and the first five years are when most models lose the majority of their value. There are exceptions to vehicle depreciation once a car reaches a certain age, among other factors, but those are few and far between. According to a study by iSeeCars, the average depreciation rate across the industry is 45.6% after five years. EVs are among the worst vehicles when it comes to holding their value, with a five-year average depreciation rate of 58.5%. There is one model in particular that manages to outdo all others when it comes to losing value, though.

The Jaguar I-Pace loses over 70% of its value in five years

The Jaguar I-Pace loses 72.2% of its value after five years, making it the fastest depreciating EV. Not only that, but, according to the iSeeCars study, it may lead the industry with the highest depreciation rate overall. No other vehicle included in the study broke the 70% barrier, although the BMW 7 Series was close at 67.1%.

The 2019 Jaguar I-Pace was originally priced from $69,500, which isn’t exactly out of the ordinary for a luxury EV. The 2019 Audi e-tron, for example, started at $74,800. The I-Pace was the cheaper of the two, and it also offered up to a 234-mile range, topping the Audi e-tron’s 204-mile offering.

Unfortunately, Jaguar doesn’t have the best track record when it comes to reliability. Combine that with an EV’s accelerated depreciation, and you’ve got the perfect storm. According to Kelley Blue Book, the fair purchase price of a top-of-the-line 2019 Jaguar I-Pace EV400 First Edition is just $21,617. That model was initially priced at $86,895, which means it is currently worth just 24.9% of its original purchase price.

An EV doomed by the manufacturer

Jaguar was quick to jump into the luxury EV arena, launching the I-Pace in late 2018 for the 2019 model year. While it was rather pricey for all but early adopters, the I-Pace offered an impressive combination of luxury appointments, performance, and range. Fast forward to 2024, and that was no longer the case. Jaguar’s EV hadn’t seen many major updates over those five years, and the brand was getting ready to launch an all-new EV for the 2025 model year.

Naturally, those plans have gone out the window. Jaguar isn’t currently manufacturing any vehicles as it transitions to reestablish itself as an all-electric automaker. Not only that, but maintenance and repairs tend to be on the expensive side.

The Jaguar I-Pace has also been the subject of multiple recalls, most of which concern the risk of battery fires. Per the NHTSA, the first recall took place in May 2023, but the manufacturer can’t quite seem to get it right, as there were five additional recalls through December 2024 covering the same overheating battery issue.

As new competition entered the fray and Jaguar failed to keep up, the I-Pace was quickly overshadowed by competitors that were more luxurious, powerful, and efficient. Just as when they were new, no one seems to want them used, especially not when there’s a pool of used EVs to choose from. Some top competitors include the Maserati Grecale Folgore, Audi SQ6 e-tron, Cadillac Optiq, and Genesis GV60.

Final thoughts

Jaguar was once a highly regarded performance brand, but it has since fallen into a rather desperate state. Plagued by high prices and questionable reliability, the British manufacturer wasn’t doing so hot when it stepped back to rebrand. Hopefully, its time away from production will help the brand find itself and unleash an entirely new slate of performance EVs into the world. Frankly, as much as I like the idea of Jaguar, it’s not a brand I would ever put in my garage in its current state.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/98b237ac294f9b8e75001a660d843f0f,N,,2025-10-11 20:59:11.827701

The Swedish automaker is planning to manufacture the next-generation hybrid model at its Ridgeville plant before 2030. Volvo designed the vehicle specifically for American customers, and the company expects it to join the XC60, EX90, and Polestar 3 in the production lineup. The Ridgeville factory is aiming for full utilization of its 150,000-vehicle annual capacity, backed by $1.3 billion in investments and upgrades since 2015.

It's no secret that drivers who choose electric or hybrid vehicles save money on routine maintenance, as EVs eliminate oil changes and many fluid replacements. They also cut down on fuel costs, enjoy quieter rides, and produce no tailpipe emissions. One MIT study found that traditional gas-powered cars create an average of 350 grams of carbon air pollution per mile driven over their lifetimes, while EVs operating on batteries charging from an average U.S. power grid produce only 200 grams per mile.

Charging an EV at home costs less than using public chargers, potentially saving hundreds of dollars annually. Qmerit helps homeowners to install powerful Level 2 EV chargers, providing free, instant installation estimates. Adding solar power into the equation really ups the savings, and EnergySage makes it a cinch to compare quotes from vetted local installers to save up to $10,000 on new solar installations.

Volvo's expanding lineup offers American drivers more choices than ever to reduce their environmental impact without sacrificing premium features and safety standards. Their upcoming hybrid model joins a growing roster of electrified options, giving those in search of their first EV plenty of compelling reasons to make the switch.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Volvo-hybrid-SUVimage-rec1Twgocfw6JsoQ8-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:42.777180

In practical reality, to reinforce its influence, the European Commission has directed its policy focus on promoting sustainable energy development during this last quarter of 2025. Unlocking new business and investment opportunities, including in the areas of manufacturing and agro-processing as well as regional and continental value chain development, forms aspects of raising confidence among a number of African countries.

The European Commission’s report explicitly indicated that this approach mirrors the new strategy and is within the context of geopolitical rivalry and competition. Its policy titled “Global Gateway Strategy” primarily aims at refining the dynamic partnerships and advancing step-by-step for establishing bilateral mutual benefits with Africa. In terms of reciprocity, African leaders and businesspeoplemust explore available possibilities and windows that have been opened, as Europe has unveiled a €300 billion (US$340 billion) alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative—an investment program the bloc claims will create links, not dependencies.

In the latest report, Europe has allocated €618 million for renewable energy projects across Africa, according to the latest reports of the European Commission. The funds are for implementing these projects in eight African countries. In Kenya, the €55 million project is the green energy system to increase generation of and strengthen the power grid. In Uganda, with €60 million, the project will electrify rural areas with a population of over 250,000 people. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, funding is for electrifying the city of Kisangani and the surrounding areas, and in Mauritania, €125 million is allocated for creating a regional energy transport corridor for a rapidly growing population.

In Nigeria, €20 million is for planned technical support and for scaling up renewable solutions, particularly for farmers and small businesses, while in Cape Verde, €39 million is given for the expansion of wind generation and energy storage systems as part of the Cabeolica project. In addition, €30 million is allocated to strengthen the energy system between Zambia and Tanzania, and the largest funding—€199 million—is for Togo, where a renewable energy and energy storage project is implemented in the city of Kpalime.

In an opinion article published by AllAfrica.com, Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has expressed candid views about the economic progress on the continent and the outstanding challenges and the unfolding opportunities there. According to the IMF director, Africa is on a new sustainable growth trajectory. But this transition is costly—at least initially—for a region that already strives to finance other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and as a result, some of these development initiatives must be shared by the international community.

Despite the new challenges, it has become important to strengthen dialogues and focus on the search for more effective financial ways to scale up sustainable development in Africa. The European Commission has to keep in mind and try to incorporate the economic diplomacy with the continent, particularly most aspects of directions that meet the commitments of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and Agenda 2063 of the African Union.",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/energy-transition.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:57.224412

OPAL Fuels, South Jersey Industries, and the Atlantic County Utilities Authority announced last week opening of the Egg Harbor Township facility.

The plant captures landfill gas from ACUA’s solid waste site and processes it into renewable natural gas, offering a lower-carbon alternative to diesel and conventional natural gas.

The facility represents the first project to deliver renewable natural gas into the pipeline system of South Jersey Gas, a subsidiary of South Jersey Industries.

With a capacity to process 2,500 standard cubic feet per minute of landfill gas, the plant is expected to produce more than 650,000 million BTUs annually, which is equivalent to over 4.6 million gasoline gallon equivalents.

“This project reduces emissions, improves local air quality, creates jobs, and strengthens American energy independence,” said Adam Comora, co-chief executive officer of OPAL Fuels in a statement.

The project makes ACUA the first public solid waste facility in New Jersey to host a renewable natural gas operation.

A second project, the Burlington facility in Florence Township, is planned as part of the partnership.

The Independence plant takes hydrogen from Bleachtech, purifies it for fuel cell use and compresses the purified gas so it can be transported to end users.
The Japanese industrial giant Sumitomo has recently invested in Independence Hydrogen, joining Suburban Propane and early-round investors from the Hivers & Strivers group, which invests veterans’ savings in veteran-run firms.
Some $136 million in tax credits through the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program are supporting the Topsøe project.","Joking that his car knows the way to Petersburg, Gov. Glenn Youngkin once again came back to the long-struggling city last Wednesday to highlight a major new economic development project — but unusually for such an event, one that did not involve any state support.

Independence Hydrogen officially opened its first plant in Petersburg, capturing hydrogen that’s otherwise an unused byproduct of Bleachtech LLC’s plant in the southern part of the city.

Bleachtech makes sodium hypochlorite, also called “hypo” or “bleach,” and sells it to water and wastewater treatment plants across the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Until now, it vented hydrogen from the five-story stacks on top of its plant.

“We said, ‘We’ll take your trash and pay you for it,’” Independence Hydrogen co-founder Bill Lehner told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Youngkin said the hydrogen operation marks a milestone in his “All American, All of the Above” state energy plan, which calls for using natural gas as well as wind and solar generation while pushing for development of small modular reactors and hydrogen as an energy source.

“What’s really exciting is that this project stands on its own economically, and they’re building because this is where they want to be, and this is the opportunity that sits in front of them with a great customer ... like Walmart and a great location, like they’ve got right here,” Youngkin said.

Walmart is the firm’s current main customer, buying the hydrogen for use in fuel cells — basically, devices that bring hydrogen and oxygen molecules together to make water. It is a process that releases electrons when the molecules combine, a process that also releases one of the two oxygen atoms in an oxygen molecule.

But Lehner said Virginia’s main natural gas utilities are also looking at using the firm’s hydrogen. Blending hydrogen with natural gas results in a fuel that emits less greenhouse gases, the cause of climate change.

The Independence plant takes hydrogen from Bleachtech, purifies it for fuel cell use and compresses the purified gas so it can be transported to end users. It employs 10 local residents.

The plant can process 1.2 metric tons of hydrogen a day, and do so at a lower cost than the other main ways of obtaining hydrogen, by zapping water with electricity to break apart the one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that form a water molecule or by exposing methane to high-pressure steam to break free its hydrogen atoms, a process that releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.

The Japanese industrial giant Sumitomo has recently invested in Independence Hydrogen, joining Suburban Propane and early-round investors from the Hivers & Strivers group, which invests veterans’ savings in veteran-run firms.

Last year, the Danish chemicals firm Topsøe Holding A/S said it would build a $400 million plant in Chesterfield County that will make a new kind of hydrogen fuel cell, one that the company says can generate clean energy for fossil fuel users like steel mills and shipping companies that cannot simply electrify operations and that generate nearly a third of the world’s greenhouse gases.

The Topsøe plant will employ 150.

Some $136 million in tax credits through the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program are supporting the Topsøe project.

North Carolina is once again America’s Top State for Business. When businesses look to move and grow in North Carolina they look at our welcoming business climate but a company they also look at our investments — in our people and our infrastructure.

A company is only as good as the people that work for it, and North Carolina boasts a skilled work force. But in order to keep business booming we have to continue to make the lives our citizens and workers better. Right now, people across North Carolina are struggling. Rising costs at the grocery store and energy bills that climbed nearly 6% nationwide last year are impacting us all. With that we have to be proactive and think about the future, not just how North Carolinians can work but how business can work for us. We can’t afford to be complacent.

There’s been a lot of talk about data centers in the news recently and some have argued that new data centers will automatically make energy more expensive for everyday customers. I’ll admit that I have had my hesitations, but I believe that when you hold reputable companies to high standards and even higher commitments, data centers can help stabilize costs and put downward pressure on energy rates.

We’ve seen this work in other states. In Georgia, utility leaders have credited large customers with allowing them to freeze base rates for three years. In Virginia, the world’s largest hub for data centers, billions in annual tax revenue have generated budget surpluses and even property tax cuts for homeowners. And in South Carolina, large facilities are paying higher costs instead of pushing that cost on tens of thousands of households. Oregon passed a law as well creating a new customer category specifically for data centers to assign energy responsibility equitably.

The key is responsibility. Data centers are going to continue to move into North Carolina but it’s important that we put in safe guards to protect North Carolina families, our communities and the environment. Data centers are required to sign long-term contracts, guarantee minimum payments, and cover the infrastructure costs their projects trigger. Many also agree to reduce or shift their power use during peak times, which relieves stress on the grid and helps avoid costly new capacity. Far from pushing bills higher, these steps help spread fixed costs more broadly and fairly.

We also have to address the root drivers of rising energy costs—aging infrastructure, volatile fuel prices, and extreme weather events. Seventy percent of our transmission lines are more than 25 years old. Utilities are being forced to make costly upgrades, and those costs shouldn’t be passed on to consumers. Add in inflationary pressures and billion-dollar damages from hurricanes and wildfires, and it’s no surprise bills are climbing.

It’s no secret that, data centers and artificial intelligence have a large energy demand, but we can take the time now to build new clean energy projects that add supply to the grid. This will also help spread out the fixed costs of running the grid, which means households aren’t carrying those expenses alone. And when new lines or maintenance is needed, it will be the data centers that are required to pay for those upgrades upfront, leaving the grid stronger and more reliable for everyone. That means more investment in energy infrastructure, steadier rates, and a fairer distribution of costs across all customers.

Communities also see direct benefits. Data centers create thousands of good-paying jobs, first in construction and the skilled trades to build the facilities, and then in long-term operations and maintenance once they’re running. And by partnering locally, data centers can help fund community projects, from weatherization upgrades that lower utility bills to resilience hubs that keep schools and community centers open during storms.

Here in North Carolina, the task before us is not to slow growth but to manage it responsibly. That means holding companies accountable for their share of infrastructure costs, prioritizing projects that deliver strong local economic value, and ensuring visible benefits for families – from weatherization upgrades that cut monthly bills to training programs that prepare workers for the clean energy jobs of the future. At the end of the day ensuring that

North Carolina families don’t shoulder the burden of rising energy usage and keep costs down.

North Carolina has the opportunity to show the rest of the country how to do this right: attract transformative investments, protect ratepayers, and strengthen our grid for the long haul. Data centers are not a threat to affordability, but a part of the solution, if we insist on clear rules and fair contributions.

US farmers are facing the quadruple whammy of tariffs, inflation, worker shortages, and climate impacts, leading to a spike in the number of bankruptcies this year. New developments in agricultural science can’t overcome all of those challenges at once, but a new agrivoltaic project in Virginia aims to demonstrate that the new energy crop of the 21st century — solar energy, that is — can help provide a lifeline to farmers and local communities in these challenging times.

Solar Panels And The New Energy Crop Of The 21st Century

Energy crops have been a familiar feature across the modern global agriculture industry for generations, with corn and soybeans currently dominating the production of ethanol and biodiesel here in the US. Although a carbon-recycling sustainability case can be made for biofuels, these traditional, land-based crops are industrial operations requiring herbicides, pesticides, heavy machinery, and transportation to and from refineries before they reach the energy consumer.

The UK consulting firm Cerulogy is among the energy analysts to run the numbers on biofuels and carbon emissions, and their numbers say that biofuels are not a particularly effective alternative to fossil fuels. “Global biofuels production emits 16% more CO2 than the fossil fuels it replaces,” explains the organization Transportation & Environment, citing a new report commissioned from Cerulogy.

“The same land could feed 1.3 billion people, while using just 3% of that land for solar panels would produce the same amount of energy,” T&E adds.

Indeed. Unlike traditional energy crops that involve long periods between harvest cycles, photovoltaic panels capture solar energy from the sun and convert it to electricity with every passing moment of daylight, delivering it directly to energy consumers or to energy storage systems as the case may be.

Small Agrivoltaic Project, Big Impact

The global solar industry could chip away further at Cerulogy’s land use estimate of 3%, by applying agrivoltaic principles that enable farmers to continue using the land in between solar panels.

Agrivoltaics is a new science, emerging on the heels of the initial solar boom of the early 2000s. Back then, the cost of solar equipment was relatively high and developers cut their costs by planting solar panels on beds of low-maintenance sand and gravel, at best seeding the land with monocrops of clover or short grasses. By 2018, though, researchers were compiling ample evidence that the shade from solar panels conserves soil moisture while enabling other shade-tolerant plants and grasses to thrive, opening the door to a powerful new tool in the farmland conservation toolkit. Since then, reducing wildfire risk has also emerged as a follow-on benefit.

To date, most agrivoltaic operations in the US focus on livestock grazing, which also helps reduce maintenance costs by preventing vegetation from overgrowing the panels. Habitat restoration to boost pollinator populations is also beginning to emerge.

Growing crops for human consumption is a next-level challenge, and that’s what the Piedmont Environmental Council in Virginia has set out to tackle. The organization’s pilot project at Roundabout Meadows in Aldie, Virginia, surfaced briefly on the CleanTechnica radar last month, when it earned the title “Plan of the Year” in the 2025 North American Agrivoltaics Awards program. Although the project weighs in at the practically minuscule size of half an acre, NAAA described the forthcoming project as a “deeply strategic installation that could have statewide ripple effects,” with the aim of launching the agrivoltaic field beyond fields for grazing and pollinator habitats, and into the human food crop area.

Agrivoltaics In Action

Activity at the PEC site was well underway by the time NAAA tapped the project for Plan of the Year, with the solar panels up and running along with an onsite energy storage system. Last week, PEC kindly emailed additional details to CleanTechnica in advance of a formal launch to be held on October 17.

The energy storage component may surprise certain high-ranking public officials who doubt that such systems exist, but there it is. “The Roundabout Meadows project will include a smart panel, which enables the farm to measure energy usage, as well as on-site battery storage,” PEC notes. The battery will enable onsite equipment to continue running on solar energy after the sun goes down, including well pumps, refrigerators, and heated greenhouses.

“Intended as a demonstration site and proof-of-concept for multiple applications, we’ve designed the 42-panel solar panel installation with four rows of vegetables directly in the ground to mimic a traditional farm setup,” PEC explains, “And four in raised beds to make the project equally relevant to smaller applications, including urban settings, rooftops, and other built environments.” Wineries, breweries, and parking lots are also on PEC’s radar.

PEC also draws attention to the broader context that supports agrivoltaic solutions for farmers and their communities. “PEC’s agrivoltaics pilot project is also part of a bigger story about agricultural and food system security and clean energy generation, battery storage, and net metering, all in a state facing unprecedented energy demands from data center development.”

15 Agrivoltaic Projects To Rule Them All

If all goes according to plan (and so far, it has), the Roundabout Meadows project will demonstrate that 42 solar panels can co-exist with eight rows of vegetables on a relatively small plot of land. Installed by the firm Tiger Solar, the solar panels are situated in three rows of 14 panels each, placed 12.5 feet apart to allow more sunlight onto the crops. The panels are also mounted on high racks measuring six feet tall, further easing access to the crop rows.

The plantings include lettuces and other vegetables known to thrive in partial shade, along with sun-loving staples like tomatoes and potatoes. The diverse selection will enable the researchers to collect data leading to recommendations for optimal plantings.

In a detailed article about the project last year, PEC described how the agrivoltaic movement has grown into a sprawling knowledge base. To launch the new project, PEC has drawn upon its experience engaging with other projects, solar industry stakeholders, and conservation groups. The new project also taps into Virginia Tech’s agrivoltaic stakeholder group, and it has earned technical assistance from agrivoltaic researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, through a Clean Energy to Communities grant. Last year, NREL also selected PEC to join a new cohort of 15 organizations conducting next-generation work in the agrivoltaic field.

PEC is already lined up to make a significant contribution to the effort. The project is designed to generate more energy than the farm currently needs, opening up the potential to replace its current stock of fuel-burning tools and equipment with electric ones.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/agrivoltaic-Piedmont-Environmental-Council-.png,N,,2025-10-11 19:02:33.096317

If all you care about is the car itself, the best two-row crossover that Consumer Reports has reviewed is the recently refreshed Tesla Model Y.
Most of the categories on this list include more than one option that Consumer Reports recommends.
If that ""something fancy"" happens to be an electric crossover, then Consumer Reports says you won't do better than the Genesis GV60.
But in Consumer Reports' testing, the GV60 beat them all.","Electric vehicles promise a lower cost of ownership, quick acceleration, quiet rides, and the opportunity for a more spacious cabin that isn't constrained by the limits of a gasoline powertrain. They also offer the opportunity to never visit a gas station ever again. Some enthusiasts may miss having a manual transmission and an actual exhaust note, but for most people, EVs are basically the ideal daily drivers. The only problem is, it can be hard to tell which ones live up to their promises and which ones fall short.

The good news is, our friends over at Consumer Reports recently put together a list of the EVs that performed the best in its testing, while also offering the safety and reliability that you want out of a new car. This isn't just a list of the EVs with the highest overall score, either, since that isn't always super helpful. Instead, they broke the list down into five different categories and made recommendations based on which EV scored the highest in that particular segment. Let's take a look at which vehicles topped Consumer Reports' list in each category.

If you're on the hunt for a good old electric sedan, Consumer Reports says you should skip the Tesla Model 3 and get the Hyundai Ioniq 6 instead. The styling is a little controversial, but the benefit is better aerodynamics, and a more slippery design means better range. Depending on the size of the battery and the configuration you go for, the Ioniq 6 offers between 240 and 361 miles of range, and when you run out of juice, it also offers seriously fast charging.

The Ioniq 6 doesn't have the biggest trunk in the world, and CR didn't love the window and mirror controls, but it's still quick, comfortable and probably more spacious than you might expect based on the design. If you want something with more of a hatchback-like shape, though, CR's second-ranked electric car is the Kia Niro EV. It's front-wheel drive and doesn't quite have the range of a higher-end Ioniq 6 or its fast charging, but as far as practical daily drivers go, the electric Niro is still a compelling, relatively affordable EV.

The BMW 3 Series is one of the best-reviewed gas-powered sport sedans, and the BMW i4 is basically an electric 3 Series with a liftback. As it turns out, that's a recipe for a seriously compelling EV. Some of the controls could take some getting used to, and you may wish the rear seat were larger, but aside from those two, relatively small issues, there really isn't much to complain about with the i4.

It's quick, sporty, offers a nicely put together cabin, the seats are comfortable, and it's also Consumer Reports' top-ranked electric luxury sedan. On the low end, an i4 M50 on 20-inch wheels only gets 227 miles of range, but if you're really concerned about range, there's always the i4 eDrive 40 on 18-inch wheels that gets 318 miles. Either way, you'll get a sporty, fun-to-drive EV that's also incredibly quiet for those times when you aren't carving canyons and just want to relax. If you want more space, though, CR's second-ranked electric luxury sedan is the larger i5, which is more or less, you guessed it, the electric version of the 5 Series.

If all you care about is the car itself, the best two-row crossover that Consumer Reports has reviewed is the recently refreshed Tesla Model Y. It's quick, corners well, offers solid range and can charge on Tesla's Supercharger network, which road trippers will appreciate. That said, the ride and controls still aren't great, there's no support for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and every dollar you spend on a Tesla helps enrich Elon Musk, who made it his personal mission to destroy the federal government from within.

Those of you who prefer not to enrich a guy who's responsible for babies being born with HIV, Consumer Reports' second-ranked two-row electric crossover is the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is also quick, sporty, and quiet. As far as range is concerned, there's one Mach-E that offers only 240 miles, but if you don't need all-wheel drive, Ford offers a version that's rated at 320 miles.

Most of the categories on this list include more than one option that Consumer Reports recommends. If you're looking for an electric minivan replacement, though, CR says there's only one SUV worth considering: the Kia EV9. EPA range can be as low as 230 miles, but frequent road trippers will probably want the long-range version and its 304 miles of range. You probably won't want to carve canyons in this family hauler, but it's spacious, comfortable and charges pretty fast, which you'll appreciate on a road trip.

In fact, even if you have the budget for a luxury EV, if you want that third row, Consumer Reports says you should still seriously consider the EV9. It might not have the most prestigious badge that you can afford, but in CR's testing, it outperformed the more expensive Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, Tesla Model X and Rivian R1S. Even if it isn't perfect, that's some seriously high praise for a Kia.

Sometimes you want something a little fancy, and as long as you can afford it, you know what? That's okay. If that ""something fancy"" happens to be an electric crossover, then Consumer Reports says you won't do better than the Genesis GV60. It looks outstanding, and the cabin is just as nice, if not nicer, than you may have been expecting. The styling means some compromises have to be made when it comes to rearward visibility, but it's a lot easier to forgive that when the GV60 looks as good as it does.

The performance version is only rated at 235 miles, but the longest-range version still does a commendable 294 miles. You'll have to give up all-wheel drive if you want to squeeze every mile out of the GV60 that you can, but it's the same story with pretty much every other EV, too. Could you buy from brands with more prestigious badges and longer histories? Sure. But in Consumer Reports' testing, the GV60 beat them all. Plus, you can't forget it also looks great.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-5-best-evs-you-can-buy-in-2025-according-to-consumer-reports/l-intro-1755886944.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:02:15.365039

Auto industry is installing many times more battery capacity than it will need, Reuters review shows

Federal raid at Hyundai’s Georgia plant marked another setback for one of the largest EV projects

STANTON, Tenn., Oct 10 (Reuters) – Stanton, Tennessee – population 450 – welcomed a massive new neighbor a few years ago: a Ford (F.N), electric-truck factory and a joint-venture battery plant slated to employ 6,000 workers.

Ford’s 2022 groundbreaking triggered an influx of construction activity into the former cotton-and-soybean farmlands outside of Memphis. Hard-hatted workers filled local diners. Developers scrambled to build homes and fire stations.

Stanton is quieter these days. Ford over the past 18 months repeatedly delayed phases of the project. The EV truck plant is slated to begin initial production in 2027 and start sending deliveries the next year, a timeline delayed several times from the original plan of coming online in 2025.

Ford said it “will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

The Ford complex is part of the so-called Battery Belt, a swath of factories stretching across the U.S. heartland that spans from Georgia to Indiana. Roughly two dozen battery projects worth tens of billions in investment have been announced this decade, promising to inject tens of thousands of jobs in Republican-dominated states like Georgia and Kentucky.

By last year, though, Americans’ waning enthusiasm for electric cars led automakers to delay or scrap some factory projects. Now, the additional fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent policy changes is descending on the Battery Belt.

Ford CEO Jim Farley last week offered the prediction that electric-car sales could fall by around 50% following the Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers, echoing other gloomy forecasts for the EV market.

The uncertain fate of these massive, high-tech factories and their employment has rattled the small rural communities that spent years hitching their economic futures to these projects.

Allan Sterbinsky, who retired as mayor of Stanton in December and advocated for the site for years before Ford came to town, said:

That’s on everybody’s mind, quite frankly,

Some residents worry that Ford will never follow through on the plant, the former mayor says. Others hope the company will repurpose the 3,600-acre site if demand doesn’t increase for EVs.

A Ford spokesperson pointed to the automaker’s community work in Stanton, including grants to public safety organizations as part of a broader $9 million commitment to the area.

A Reuters review of U.S. battery-investment plans shows those worries are justified. The industry appears headed toward a huge glut of factory capacity, if all those projects were to move ahead as planned.

By 2030, the planned battery plants would provide the capacity to produce 13 million to 15 million EVs annually, according to figures provided to Reuters by research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. But the industry now might only need about one-quarter of that factory space. S&P Global Mobility predicts only around 3 million EVs will be produced that year, and some would likely use batteries imported from other countries.

Some of that excess roughly 10 million-EV worth of battery capacity would likely be used for hybrids and extended-range EVs as well as the booming energy storage industry, but there is still a sizable gulf, said Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global Mobility automotive analyst.

The demise of the $7,500 tax credit – which had been in place for more than 15 years to persuade Americans to try green cars – is only the highest profile of several anti-EV measures put forth by the Trump administration. Combined, they further jeopardize battery projects and other electric-car-related investments, experts say. In the last few months several automakers have canceled, delayed or downsized EV projects.

Meanwhile, a pot of tens of billions of dollars available to companies that make EV batteries domestically has tighter restrictions that will likely reduce the amount of federal money that flows to the battery sites.

Jennifer Stafeil, tax auto sector lead for KPMG, said:

All of a sudden, much of what was originally going to benefit from these credits now no longer can to a large degree

Trump has said he is not anti-EV, but prefers that consumers decide what cars to buy, without government influence. He also has criticized EV-friendly regulations implemented under former President Joe Biden, which Trump has said were costly and threatened American auto jobs.

One of the nation’s largest EV projects, Hyundai Motor’s $12.6 billion assembly plant and joint-venture battery factory near Savannah, Georgia, is moving ahead. Last month the project suffered a setback when federal law enforcement raided it. Hyundai has said the fallout would delay the battery plant by at least two to three months.

In the three years since Hyundai (005380.KS), announced the megasite, 21 suppliers have opened operations near the site.

A spokesperson said:

Hyundai is committed to offering a diverse product lineup, including internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and EV models.

“We understand that every customer is unique, and we strive to meet a wide range of needs,”

The complex is gearing up to hire 8,500 employees by 2031, and is paying wages 25% above the county average, said Trip Tollison, president of the Savannah Economic Development Authority.

Tollison acknowledged that some in the community worry about the uncertain future of the nascent EV industry that underpins all that development. He is hopeful Hyundai can flexibly shift to hybrid production if the EV market doesn’t take off.

He said:

That’s how you provide opportunities like this to lift people out of poverty,

The project can generate leasing money for landowners and farmers while powering tens of thousands of homes, according to Clean Wisconsin.
It makes sense to combine solar and wind energy because solar energy peaks during the day, while wind is typically stronger at night or during different times of year.","Wisconsin is returning to the wind energy game after 14 years without new projects, which is a lot for the US. The Public Service Commission (PSC) authorized a 118 megawatt wind farm in Grant and Iowa counties on September 26, 2025. The decision, according to campaign leaders like Rick Coelho and advocates like Clean Wisconsin, means huge progress on climate change, more renewable energy on the grid, and stronger local economies.

At the same time, regulators approved the 180-megawatt Whitewater Solar Farm, showing the synergy between solar and wind energy. When combined, these actions show that cleaner power can reduce emissions, create jobs, and boost environmental health. The approvals also point to a larger trend: state leaders are viewing renewables as useful tools for long-term resilience instead of just carbon cutters.

What Wisconsin approved—and why it matters

Wisconsin’s first wind farm since 2011 was approved by the PSC and this 118 MW project is located in Grant and Iowa counties, proving that wind development is once again on the rise.

The project can generate leasing money for landowners and farmers while powering tens of thousands of homes, according to Clean Wisconsin.

Renewable energy projects progress when regulations are clear, communities are involved, and environmental objectives are well-defined. And so the state authorized the 180 MW Whitewater Solar Farm, located close to the Jefferson–Walworth county boundary, in the same round of rulings. It makes sense to combine solar and wind energy because solar energy peaks during the day, while wind is typically stronger at night or during different times of year.

According to research by Clean Wisconsin, there are other benefits, like better water quality when solar panels reduce fertilizer from specific crops. Therefore, regulators see these permits as a reaction to climate policy, local economic strength, and environmental health. Initiatives like the Badger Hollow Project, that help the state in gaining knowledge in operations, location, and community benefits, are also part of this environment.

What “energy transition” means for communities

The effects that have on families show up in three simple ways:

Reliable electricity: By incorporating wind and solar energy, Wisconsin’s clean energy supply is improved. These resources work in parallel to reducing reliance on fossil fuels because their peaks happen at different periods. This helps many states achieve their bigger energy transition goals.

Local opportunity. For farmers and landowners, land leases can offer regular revenue, and construction and maintenance create jobs. Communities benefit more when they are involved from the beginning, helping to choose appropriate sites, establishing project guidelines, and communicating the outcomes, according to advocates like Rick Coelho.

Cleaner surroundings: Since renewable energy sources don’t burn fuel, they don’t emit any pollutants while they’re in use either. In order to improve the project execution, regulators are also pushing for bigger and more effective turbines that are made to produce less noise and collect more energy per unit. By linking renewable energy to cleaner lakes and streams, the state also demonstrated possible improvements in water quality with the Whitewater Solar Farm.

A transparent planning and siting process provides a fair approach for developers and communities, making easier the development of the projects.

The road up ahead

Wind and solar energy can power homes, provide income in rural communities, and reduce pollution all at once thanks to the wind projects in Iowa and Grant counties. Wisconsin already has a foundation to grow around, as shown by projects like the Badger Hollow Project. Now that new wind is coming online after years of silence, the state can develop more quickly and wisely.

What comes now? Continue involving communities, monitoring outcomes, refining design, and finding benefits that people can observe.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wind-farm-Wisconsin.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 18:01:05.781438

I write with respect to our continuing effort to reopen the government, negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement and decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis.

In the coming weeks, hardworking American taxpayers will experience dramatically increased healthcare premiums, copays and deductibles. Tens of millions of Americans will see their insurance payments increase by thousands of dollars per year, in an environment where the cost of living is already too high. That is why we must extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits immediately.

At the same time, Republicans have enacted the largest cut to Medicaid in American history, ripping healthcare away from millions of people. As a result of the Republican healthcare crisis, hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health centers are closing throughout the country. Urgent action is needed now.

Democrats remain ready to reopen the government and pay our troops. We will continue to strongly support federal workers who have been under vicious attack from the Trump administration all year. Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Rubber Stamp Republicans in Congress have pursued a my way or the highway, go-it-alone approach from the very beginning of his presidency. They would rather close the government than continue Affordable Care Act tax credits for working-class Americans and middle-class families.

Equally troublesome, Republicans have completely abdicated their governance responsibility by cancelling votes in the House for a third consecutive week. Instead of voting on legislation to reopen the government, pay our troops and address the Republican healthcare crisis, they remain on vacation.

That is why it is critically important for House Democrats to once again return to Washington to stand up for the healthcare of everyday Americans, pay our active duty troops and support hardworking federal civil servants. On Tuesday, October 14 at 6:00 p.m., we will convene at the Capitol for an in-person House Democratic Caucus meeting to discuss the path forward in connection with the Republican Shutdown and the healthcare crisis they have created. The next day, on Wednesday, October 15, there will be a full slate of work-related activities, including an action on the Capitol Steps, another Caucus meeting, a Steering & Policy hearing on rising healthcare costs, press engagements and our third virtual National Town Hall as we speak directly to the American people.

Thank you for your continued leadership and strength of purpose. I look forward to seeing you back in Washington as we fight to reopen the government, cancel the cuts, lower the cost and save healthcare.

Sincerely,

Hakeem Jeffries

In 2024, almost two trillion dollars were invested worldwide in clean energy, and for every euro dollar spent on fossil fuels, more than two went into clean energy.
We will never unlock the full potential of clean energy abundance if the stories we tell focus on scarcity and sacrifice.
Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said: “We are entering the age of renewable abundance and this Global Renewable Summit proves it.
On energy security, energy justice, energy independence, there are so many new elements that have come together to drive lower prices, create simpler technologies and growth through easier to install infrastructure.”","In Short : Global leaders from governments and businesses have pledged to accelerate the transition toward renewable energy abundance. The commitment focuses on expanding clean energy investments, enhancing technology adoption, and strengthening international cooperation. By promoting large-scale deployment of solar, wind, and green hydrogen, the initiative aims to achieve global climate goals and drive sustainable economic growth worldwide.

In Detail : New York, USA – An exceptional group of government leaders, private sector executives, and figureheads from civil society financiers came together today for the High-Level Session on Renewable Energy Abundance, a flagship event of Climate Week NYC and the high-level opening of the Global Renewables Summit.

The event showcased their commitment to accelerating the build-out of zero-emissions infrastructure, driving a transformation that will reshape entire economies and societies. These technologies are already ushering in a new era of global prosperity, innovation, competitiveness, and resilience, while reducing energy costs for businesses and communities.

The leaders discussed the coordinated action needed to raise ambition, set policies to significantly increase renewable capacity, and tackle obstacles that are holding back progress.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage alongside leaders such as the Hon President William Ruto of Kenya; the Hon Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas; Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen of Australia; founder and Executive Chairman Andrew Forrest of Fortescue; CEO and Founder Bruce Douglas of the Global Renewables Alliance; and Chair of the Board Mike Rann of Climate Group.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: “The energy transition has truly taken off. In 2024, almost two trillion dollars were invested worldwide in clean energy, and for every euro dollar spent on fossil fuels, more than two went into clean energy. And the economic case is clear. The momentum is real. But we all know that momentum alone is not enough. We need action. So to usher in a true age of renewable abundance with clean, affordable energy for all, we must act decisively. We must act as governments and industry, and we must act together, across borders, across continents. Clean energy is not only about addressing climate change. It is, in my view, also about energy security and about prosperity.

So my message to the CEOs and investors that are here today, is please tell us what you need, what guarantees, what risk sharing tools, or what is the regulatory conducive environment that you need, that we can provide that will allow you to invest at scale where it matters most. And what must governments do to help you deliver. In return, of course, we ask you to put your capital, your technologies, your innovation to work in the regions where it will have the greatest impact, so that together, we deliver on net zero, strengthen energy security, and that together we drive prosperity.”

The high-level session, organised by Climate Group, Fortescue and the Global Renewables Alliance, took place at a critical time for the global energy transition; just two days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, where many countries are expected to announce their NDCs (national climate action plans).

Hon Prime Minister Philip Davis of of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas said: “We need to be the most passionate and effective evangelists for the proposition that energy reforms will expand our possibilities, not limit them. We need decision makers everywhere to understand that replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not come at the expense of prosperity, but is a prerequisite for future prosperity. We will never unlock the full potential of clean energy abundance if the stories we tell focus on scarcity and sacrifice. Instead, let’s do a better job at painting a vivid picture for our citizens of a future in which clean energy generates prosperity that is broadly shared.

We know the work of energy reform is complex, expensive and at times overwhelming. Yet we also know that every panel installed, every regulation modernized, every grid, moves us closer to a world where energy abundance is real. The point is not perfection. The point is progress, and the belief that by working together, each step we take strengthens the chance of success for us all.”

The leaders discussed how the global economy is moving from an era of energy constraints to one defined by energy possibilities, and how renewable energy and electrification are becoming the bedrock of future prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness. They delved deep into the need to work towards a future in which energy security, affordability, and sustainability reinforce one another, creating widespread social and economic benefits.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said: “We are entering the age of renewable abundance and this Global Renewable Summit proves it. Renewables now lead the way in new power generation, with investments growing 14% annually since 2018, despite pandemics, inflation, and geopolitical shocks. But the story is incomplete: emerging markets and developing economies, representing a third of global GDP, still capture less than 10% of energy transition finance. As we head toward COP30 and deliver on the UAE Consensus mandate to triple renewables by 2030, we must put equity and impact at the heart of this transition.”

For families and communities, this will mean lower energy costs, enhanced energy security, and new economic opportunities. For industry, it will mean an unprecedented chance to scale innovation — from artificial intelligence to advanced manufacturing — powered by near-limitless clean energy.

Bruce Douglas, CEO of the Global Renewables Alliance underlined: “The path is clear: phasing out volatile fossil fuels whilst delivering renewable energy abundance is how we create prosperity, stability and real energy security. However – if we want to build the clean, resilient and competitive energy system of the future – we must all stand up, come together and act now.”

Ambassador André Correa do Lago, President-Designate, COP30 said: “The association of renewables with other agendas is a very important step forward. On energy security, energy justice, energy independence, there are so many new elements that have come together to drive lower prices, create simpler technologies and growth through easier to install infrastructure.”",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/International-Renewable-Energy-Agency_IRENA-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 16:02:22.188070

Governments want EVs. Automakers are racing to deliver them. But for car enthusiasts, this all-electric rush isn’t just about saving the planet—it’s reshaping the hobby we love. And not in a good way.

The EV Mandate: Killing ICE Icons

Automakers are dumping R&D money into EVs to meet global emissions rules, and guess what’s getting cut?

Manual transmissions are disappearing almost completely.

Affordable sports cars like the Camaro and Challenger are gone.

Even long-running models like the Mustang and Porsche 911 face uncertain futures beyond the next decade.

And the few ICE performance cars still around? They’re more expensive than ever because they’re being treated like “last hurrah” halo products.

EVs Aren’t Cheaper—For Anyone

Enthusiasts were told EVs would make performance accessible, but the reality is brutal:

The average new EV price in 2025? Nearly $54,000.

Lightweight, affordable sports EVs basically don’t exist yet—everything’s a heavy crossover or a 1,000-horsepower hyper-sedan.

Battery replacement costs still scare off buyers, especially for cars meant to be driven hard.

EV Performance is Impressive… But Soulless

Yes, Teslas and Rimacs are blisteringly fast. But enthusiasts aren’t just here for 0-60 times. We want:

Manual gear changes.

Exhaust crackles and engine character.

Lightweight cars with personality—not 5,000-lb torque monsters.

As great as EV acceleration is, many enthusiasts describe it as “video-game fast”—instant, efficient, but emotionally flat.

Who’s Still Fighting for Us?

All is not lost. Some automakers are still throwing us a bone:

Toyota & Lexus – Developing synthetic fuels and keeping manual transmissions alive in GR models.

Porsche – Promising to preserve ICE 911s as long as possible.

Dodge – Experimenting with “eMuscle” that mimics V8 sound (cringe? maybe… but at least they’re trying).

And synthetic fuels, hybrids, and biofuels could extend the life of enthusiast cars well past the EV deadline.

The EV push was supposed to move us forward. But for enthusiasts, it feels like we’re being shoved into an expensive, characterless future while our favorite ICE cars die off early. The good news? Enthusiast demand isn’t dead.

A report from Mercom has stated that India’s solar manufacturing sector has seen significant growth in H1 2025, which underscores the nation’s efforts to increase the capacity in the market.

Mercom Capital Group reports an increase in solar manufacturing in India

For a nation with the exceedingly large population that India has, fostering renewable energy is needed to deliver acceptable electricity levels to the grid, while keeping the non-renewable energy sector relatively productive.

In a move that is unprecedented for India, solar imports declined while exports saw a significant increase during the first half of 2025. A new Mercom India Research report states that PV module production capacity is rising by 44.2 GW and cell capacity by 7.5 GW.

The total capacity listed under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-I and List-II has now reached 109.5 GW for modules and nearly 17.9 GW for cells, respectively.

According to Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu, despite the huge PV production capacity, actual operational capacities can be 30% to 40% lower. Mr Prabhu believes that ALMM-certified capacities deliver a more accurate reflection of supply, even though wattage breakdown is not specified.

As of June of this year, there were 91.5 GW of module manufacturing capacity across various technologies and wattages with ALMM certification, and 13.5 GW of cell capacity was listed under ALMM List-II out of all installed cell production capacity.

“New module lines typically take several months to stabilize before reaching full utilization, while smaller facilities continue to operate at lower levels, constrained by outdated technologies, lack of scale, and lower wattage modules that are no longer in demand. This has led to fewer orders and accelerated consolidation with only larger manufacturers that possess scale, efficiency and credibility remaining competitive” – Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu

Donald Trump’s tariffs have affected the export of Indian made solar capacity

The world became aware of Donald Trump’s plans to implement tariffs on a variety of nations when he began his second term. On day one, he stated that the United States would implement tariffs on India, which has now affected the solar manufacturing sector.

During the reporting period of the Mecom report, India imported 44.6 GW of solar modules and cells, with the former accounting for 34% and the latter 66%, which underscores the progress being made by India in the sector.

“Exports have also been hit hard. Shipments to the United States, which accounted for more than 95% of Indian module exports, have come to a halt after the recent 50 tariff.” – Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu

As the United States will continue to rely on solar and storage capacity in its nation, India will need to consider its next move to alleviate the pressure on the solar manufacturing sector.

The ship’s smooth delivery is a major reason why the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm is progressing fast enough to have a new March 2026 launch date.","The first wind farm slated to plug into New York City’s grid has already endured one political catastrophe this year. Now, a logistical crisis looms on the horizon.

Equinor’s Empire Wind is a 810-megawatt project being built about 20 miles off the shore of Long Island, promising enough energy to power 500,000 homes once completed in 2027. The Trump administration halted construction in April, but allowed it to resume in May. The latest challenge came on Thursday with the unexpected cancellation of a contract for the massive new wind-turbine installation vessel that Equinor had been planning to use on the project next year.

Two shipbuilding companies broke out into a public skirmish — one unexpectedly cancelling a contract and the other threatening legal action — over the construction of the specialized ship. The fate of the vessel, which is already more than 98% complete and floating in Singapore’s waters, is now uncertain.

The cancelled $475 million agreement leaves Equinor scrambling to figure out how to maintain progress and bring Empire Wind online on schedule.

“We have been informed by Maersk of an issue concerning its contract with Seatrium related to the wind turbine installation vessel originally contracted by Empire Offshore Wind LLC for use in 2026,” said an Equinor spokesperson via email. ​“We are currently assessing the implications of this issue and evaluating available options.”

Only a handful of vessels in the world are capable of lifting, carrying, and piecing together the massive steel components of offshore turbines.

Thursday’s news highlights the complexity of bringing just one U.S. offshore wind farm over the finish line, given the combination of logistical difficulties and political obstacles put up by the Trump administration.

In an email to Canary Media, Maersk Offshore Wind spokesperson Caroline Knox confirmed that the company terminated its building contract with Seatrium ​“due to delays and related construction issues.” Knox declined to comment further.

Seatrium told Reuters it was evaluating its options for the vessel, including via ongoing talks with Empire Wind, and considering legal action.

Singapore-based Seatrium is fresh off the monumental achievement of berthing a first-of-its-kind offshore-wind installation vessel in U.S. waters. In September, the company delivered the $715 million Charybdis from its Brownsville, Texas, shipyard to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia. The American-made vessel is owned by utility Dominion Energy, which immediately put it to work building the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. The ship’s smooth delivery is a major reason why the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm is progressing fast enough to have a new March 2026 launch date.

The ship’s hull is 472 feet long and 184 feet wide, making it one of the biggest vessels of its kind in the world. And, more importantly, it was built to serve the entire U.S. sector — not just Dominion Energy’s project. In other words, the Charybdis could be a solution to Equinor’s new problem.

“Upon the completion of its charter with [Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind], the versatile Charybdis will be available to support a variety of projects, including offshore wind and other critical heavy lift shoreline projects, such as salvage operations or other energy projects,” said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion Energy representative, in an email to Canary Media.

An Equinor spokesperson provided no comment about Charybdis but reiterated that the company is exploring all options.

The nations in attendance were some of the biggest economies in the world, which laid out their nationally determined contributions. The world has become acutely aware that the need to adopt renewable energy has become as urgent as ever, and several countries, like China, have taken significant steps towards reaching their lofty ambitions of decarbonization.

The nations of the world are working hard to meet the goals set out by the Paris Agreement

When the nations of the world came together in Paris to discuss and make commitments to the global decarbonization efforts, the meeting was hailed as an epitome of global cooperation. Throughout history, rarely have the biggest nations of the world come together to agree on anything, let alone something as divisive as the climate.

However, in an unprecedented move, the nations of the world laid out their countries ‘ commitments to reaching the decarbonization goals. While every nation in attendance at the event in New York has taken significant steps to reduce its emissions, China has done more than any other nation.

Of the nations shown attended, the majority outlined their nationally determined contributions, while those who did not are expected to do so in the coming weeks before the leaders meet in Belem, Brazil, for the 30th meeting of the U.N. Conference of the Parties (COP30). Among the nations that have already expressed their NDCs are:

China

The European Union

Peru

Türkiye

several small island states

Several nations have already expressed their NDCs before the event, while some are yet to release theirs, but are expected to do so in the near future.

While progress has been made, more needs to be done to reach the global decarbonization goals

The NDCs already expressed are commendable, but praise will only get you so far before more tangible action is required. Every nation can claim they are doing its best to reach its emission goals, but a lack of investments and slow adoption of the renewable energy sector has led to many pointing out that the pace of transformation is not fast enough.

“It is hopeful, but not fast enough, nor at the scale needed. Good direction of travel notwithstanding, this is not enough action to avert the worst impacts climate change will visit upon the people of this planet. Countries need to keep turning these promises into clear action at home.” – Manish Bapna, president and CEO of NRDC

China has emerged as a leader in the global community regarding actual steps taken by the government in reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. Europe has seen robust demand for renewable energy capacity, but more needs to be done to adopt the technology.

China has outlined its ambitions during President Xi’s speech to the assembly. He highlighted several measures the Chinese have taken, which include bringing the total installed wind and solar capacity to 3,600 gigawatts, among others.

It is a curious twist of fate that Scotland’s oil and gas reserves are declining just as climate change creates a need to move towards low-carbon sources of energy. And it is a hugely serendipitous one that Scotland is so well placed to become a global leader in renewable energy.

However, a new report by Future Economy Scotland spells out just how poorly this country has been capitalising on its good fortune. For, while 18,000 direct and indirect jobs in oil and gas have been lost since 2014, only 6,000 have been created in clean energy.

Juan-Pedro Castro, an economist at the think tank, said: “The North Sea is a maturing basin – reserves are running out, and extraction is increasingly uneconomic. While critics like to blame net zero for the industry’s decline, the reality has more to do with geology and economics. Like it or not, Scotland must now prepare for life beyond fossil fuels.”

Missed opportunities will be snapped up

The report warns oil and gas jobs could decline by anything from 20 per cent to a staggering 50 per cent by 2030. If correct, this is the kind of situation that should be regarded as close to a national emergency.

The Scottish and UK governments should be urgently working with both each other and the energy industry to find ways to ensure the loss of oil jobs is slowed and the growth of green energy jobs is dramatically increased. If the overall rate of decline across both sectors continues, the wider economic consequences will be severe, particularly for the North East, and overseas competitors will snap up our missed opportunities.

There has been much talk about a ‘just transition’ for oil and gas workers, so that they can move to well-paid jobs in renewables and avoid the fate of 1980s coal miners. But all too often it has been ‘just talk’.

Scotland has lost three oil and gas jobs for every one clean energy job created over the past decade, new research has shown, with the impact described as “devastating”.

A report published by the think-tank Future Economy Scotland (FES) warns the country risks repeating the mistakes of past deindustrialisation.

The research said total employment supported by North Sea oil and gas had fallen by a third (32 per cent) since 2014, amounting to 34,000 job losses.

The findings come as a Chinese company piles pressure on the UK government to approving its controversial plans for a massive wind turbine factory in Scotland.

Ming Yang unveiled details of its proposals for a project earmarked for Ardersier port in the Highlands, which would involve investment of up to £1.5 billion and create as many as 1,500 jobs.

But the UK government has not yet given the company permission to move ahead with the plans and a source told The Scotsman ministers would not be “rushed into anything when there are several factors, including national security, to consider”.

FES said just 6,000 new direct and supply chain jobs in clean energy have been created since 2014, compared to 18,000 equivalent oil and gas jobs lost.

And forecasts show oil and gas jobs could decline by another 20 to 50 per cent by 2030, threatening tens of thousands more roles, the think-tank said.

The new report calls for pro-active policy decisions to ""fully seize the economic opportunities offered by decarbonisation"". It argues the energy transition could create up to 40,000 more jobs than will be lost by 2030 if decisive action is taken.

The report is published today as the SNP gathers in Aberdeen for the party's annual conference.

""Our research shows that, with the right ambition and policy support, the net zero transition can create more energy jobs than will be lost. But to make that happen, we need far more pro-active policies to create green jobs, retrain workers, and guarantee a just transition for the workers and communities.”

The report recommends the Scottish Government develops a clear transition roadmap while implementing an ambitious green industrial strategy.

It also calls for expanded retraining programmes and a boost to college funding, as well as improved pay and conditions in green sectors.

Scottish Conservative energy spokesman Douglas Lumsden said: “This grim report exposes the devastating impact on jobs in the oil and gas sector due to the SNP and Labour’s hostility towards it.

“Everyone wants action on an energy transition, but reckless policies from the UK and Scottish governments mean a demolition of the oil and gas industry is happening at a rapid pace.

“While we still rely on oil and gas, it’s just common sense we should be producing it here in Scotland.”

He added: “Our oil and gas sector stands at a cliff-edge, but the Scottish Conservatives will continue to fight their corner and demand an affordable transition that protects jobs and brings down bills for consumers.”

A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “Renewable energy is already boosting Scotland’s economy and will provide many more jobs for the communities across the country as well as wider infrastructure benefits.

“We are also very clear in our support for a just transition for Scotland’s valued oil and gas sector, recognising the maturity of the North Sea basin and in line with our climate change commitments and energy security.

“Workers are at the heart of the transition, and we are supporting them with the powers available to us. Through initiatives such as the Just Transition Fund and the Energy Transition Fund, we have already invested £120 million to support the North East’s transition to net zero helping to create green jobs, support innovation and secure the highly skilled workforce of the future.”

Under the first of three phases, Ming Yang said it would invest up to £750 million in an advanced manufacturing facility – with the first production taking place by late 2028.

Latter phases would see the facility expand and create an “offshore wind industry ecosystem” around the hub.

Ming Yang announced its plans on Friday following discussions with the Scottish and UK governments over the past two years, and just days after a huge global investment summit in Edinburgh attended by Ming Yang UK chief executive Aman Wang.

The company has been waiting since the spring for UK government approval for them to enter the British renewables supply chain, amid national security concerns.

Ming Yang signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government in 2021 but has not yet received permission to proceed.

A UK government source told The Scotsman the company “seems to be trying to pre-empt us”, adding that “we’re not being rushed into anything when there are several factors, including national security, to consider”.

Ming Yang is the only company that can produce floating wind turbines for the European market, with 60 per cent of the ScotWind contract for floating wind - making up around 15GW of energy.

First Minister John Swinney has previously said that floating offshore wind is “central to my vision for Scotland’s future as a modern and dynamic nation”.

Ardersier, near Inverness, is one of the “green freeport” initiatives which offer tax and customs incentives to encourage investment.

Last month Ming Yang and Octopus Energy announced they would be in partnership to develop new wind projects.

Zhang Chuanwei, founder and chairman of the Ming Yang group, said: We are excited by the prospect of investing in the UK and look forward to finalising our investment decision.”

Mr Wang said: “We firmly believe that by moving forward with our plans to create jobs, skills and a supply chain in the UK, we can make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.

“We fully support the Government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower, and I’m confident that once the plans are approved we can make a valued contribution to this goal.”

A UK government spokesperson said: “This is one of a number of companies that wants to invest in the UK. Any decisions made will be consistent with our national security.”

In November last year, Conservative MP Nick Timothy asked energy minister Michael Shanks about Ming Yang’s plans to invest in Scotland, saying the Government should rule out investment from “hostile states”.

He said Ming Yang “benefits from huge subsidies in China but there are serious questions about energy security and national security”.","https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2025/10/10/15/45/Scotland-has-lost-three-oil-and-gas-jobs-for-every-one-created-in-clean-energy.jpeg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&trim=94,0,96,0&crop=",N,,2025-10-11 18:01:10.461168

On September 12, 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") proposed to effectively put an end to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (""GHGRP""), which currently requires certain industrial facilities in the U.S. to measure and report greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions to EPA (the ""Proposal""). The proposal would remove reporting obligations for all but one source category in the current rule (petroleum and natural gas systems). This alert explains the Proposal and comments on its potential effect on certain affected industries.

Background

The Clean Air Act (""CAA""), the main federal law in the United States that governs air pollution,1 sets out a comprehensive regulatory framework administered largely by EPA but implemented in partnership with state governments to improve air quality and regulate sources of air pollution. The CAA was first enacted in 1970 and received its last significant overhaul in 1990. The CAA did not expressly provide EPA with the authority to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide or other GHGs, but Congress and the EPA have still tried to use it to that end.

EPA created the GHGRP in 2009.2 The GHGRP requires large GHG emitters to monitor and report their annual GHG emissions to EPA, and thus functions as an information-collection and transparency program. According to the Proposal, approximately 8,200 facilities, suppliers, and CO2 injection sites submit annual data under the GHGRP. Over time, EPA has expanded the GHGRP to cover 47 different industries, ranging from petroleum and natural gas systems to landfills and manure management facilities. EPA estimates that compliance with the program costs affected industries $303 million annually ($256 million of which is incurred by companies in the petroleum and natural gas industries).

EPA issued the rule under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. Section 114 states (in relevant part) that the EPA Administrator may require owners or operators of emissions sources, equipment manufacturers, or others subject to the CAA to make reports to the EPA for the purpose of (i) developing implementation plans, standards, and regulations, (ii) determining whether any person is in violation of such plans and standards, or (iii) carrying out any provision of the CAA other than a provision of Title II (relating to motor vehicle emissions).

The Proposal

The Proposal seeks to completely eliminate reporting obligations for 46 of the 47 industries required to report under the GHGRP (referred to as source categories). The Proposal does not remove those obligations for most petroleum and natural gas systems, as the data collected from those systems under the GHGRP are necessary to calculate the waste emissions charge enacted in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. However, because the collection of the waste emissions charge was postponed until 2034 by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Proposal suspends the reporting requirements for affected systems until that time.

The Proposal points back to the express terms of Section 114 of the CAA as the legal basis for the repeal of the GHGRP. As previously discussed, Section 114 authorizes EPA to require regulated entities to submit information necessary for EPA to carry out certain responsibilities under the CAA. In the Proposal, EPA asserts that its authority under Section 114 is not unlimited, and that the agency must show that any information it requires is relevant to EPA's actions or obligations under the CAA. The Proposal points out that data collected under the GHGRP (from 47 source categories over more than 10 years) has rarely been used by EPA to inform new source performance standards. Moreover, the Proposal expressly states that EPA is not planning to develop any such regulations at this time. The Proposal therefore concludes that EPA lacks authority to continue to collect GHGRP data under Section 114 because the reporting requirements do not serve any underlying statutory purpose.

Alternatively, the Proposal characterizes the GHGRP as discretionary under Section 114, since the statute says that EPA ""may"" collect information. Current EPA leadership thus argues that it can simply terminate the GHGRP on the grounds that the Administrator no longer considers the information necessary to carry out the requirements of the CAA. The Proposal states that, if information submitted under the Program is needed for any purpose, the Administrator could simply issue a new information request under Section 114, as done for other purposes under the CAA.

What does the Proposal mean for companies?

The practical effect of the repeal of the GHGRP is expected to be fairly limited for most industries. The Proposal notes that $256 million of the total $303 million annual cost of the program are concentrated in the petroleum and natural gas industries. For all other industries subject to the program, the total annual cost of the program is only approximately $50 million. When that figure is spread across all of the companies required to report, the total annual cost of the program appears to be fairly modest for most of the regulated industries.

Arguably, larger companies are less likely to be affected by the Proposal. Those companies often collect and disclose GHG emissions data for reasons unrelated to U.S. federal law. For example, those companies may have foreign legal obligations, internal and/or publicly-stated ESG commitments, and buyer/supplier demands for greener products that require them to calculate and report their GHG emissions on a regular basis. Thus, we do not expect many larger companies to cease tracking and reporting of GHGs based solely on the Proposal. Some smaller and domestic entities, however, such as municipal landfills and wastewater treatment plants, have fewer competing obligations. Those entities may therefore see some practical benefit from no longer having to collect and report GHG emissions data to EPA.

The Proposal also notes that some 20 U.S. states implement state-level greenhouse gas reporting that either incorporates 40 CFR Part 98 by reference or relies on data collected under the GHGRP. Facilities in those states may continue to have an obligation to collect and report their data to state regulators. The administration's proposal to repeal federal data collection requirements may also spur additional states to pass their own programs that apply within their borders.

Since the data collected by the GHGRP is used for a variety of purposes, we also expect to see some impacts on other federal regulatory programs. The Proposal notes that the data is used to inform the phase down of hydrofluorocarbons under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, and in the implementation of federal tax credits for carbon dioxide sequestration (45Q) and clean hydrogen production (45V). EPA acknowledges that the data collected by the GHGRP is important for those programs, but argues that those benefits are not required to carry out the Agency's functions under the CAA, and should be collected in different, more efficient ways. If the Proposal goes through, we would anticipate further regulatory action will be required by EPA, the Treasury Department and some state governments to implement new reporting specific to those programs.

Repeal of the reporting requirements would also lead to the loss of detailed information about GHG emissions in the United States beyond 2024. That information is currently collected by the Electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT) and made available to the public through the Envirofacts and Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool (""FLIGHT""). The Proposal states that EPA does not intend to ""maintain the electronic functionality of the information collection system"" after repeal, so it is unclear whether the GHG data in those systems will remain available. That information is widely used by researchers and policymakers to track, inform, and evaluate policy regarding GHG emissions. While that information can be collected through other means, the loss of that information may impact policy making in the future.

Broader context

The Trump administration has not hidden its skepticism about climate change and the risk it poses to human health and the environment. In July 2025 the Department of Energy (""DOE"") issued a report titled ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate."" According to the DOE's website, one of the key findings of the report is that ""carbon dioxide (CO2)-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and that aggressive mitigation strategies could be more harmful than beneficial."" The administration has taken several steps that are consistent with that view, including (a) withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, (b) proposing to repeal the 2009 ""endangerment finding"" which found that certain GHGs cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public welfare (and thus established the need to regulate GHGs under the CAA), (c) proposing to repeal all GHG emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, and (d) announcing its intent to spend $625 million to expand power generation fueled by coal and open 13 million acres of federal land for coal leasing. Those actions, plus the proposed repeal of the GHGRP, demonstrate that the current administration has committed to reduce, if not eliminate, GHG regulation at the federal level in the U.S.

Next steps

The EPA is collecting comments on the Proposal until November 3, 2025. For more information on the Proposal and instructions on how to comment, please see EPA's fact sheet.

If adopted, the final language of the Proposal would take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. The Proposal states that, if implemented, 2024 would be the final reporting year, meaning affected entities would not need to submit 2025 data in 2026.

The Proposal may face legal challenges. Potential challengers include environmental advocacy groups, states, and local governments or tribes that rely on GHGRP data for policymaking and enforcement. Litigation may focus on EPA's interpretation of its authority under the CAA (particularly Section 114) or the consistency of the Proposal with the CAA's statutory purposes. Plaintiffs may also seek to stay implementation of the rule once finalized, pending judicial review.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:43.990867

The “Work and Save” program would allow those who opt in to save directly through a payroll deduction before they even see their paycheck.
The money is professionally managed through private-sector investment managers selected by the North Carolina Small Business Retirement Savings Program Board.
Lowery announced his resignation from the North Carolina General Assembly on the House floor on Sept. 23.
“This proposal, over 10 years, would save Medicaid a half a billion dollars,” said Steven Hahn, North Carolina AARP communications lead.","For some North Carolinians, the road to retirement is anything but even.

While some workers can count on employer-backed savings plans, nearly half of North Carolinians will be left navigating the path to their golden years without a map, according to an AARP analysis.

The AARP Policy Institute found that in 2020, over 48 percent of North Carolina’s private sector employees — roughly 1,823,000 people — were employed by a business that does not offer any type of retirement plan.

A proposal to help people save for retirement that’s before the General Assembly could help bridge that gap by giving hundreds of thousands of uncovered workers a clearer path toward financial security in their later years.

“It is a great way to not only save the state money, but really push for a kind of self-reliance, and encourage folks to create that culture of saving,” said Chris Brandenburg, North Carolina AARP manager of state and federal advocacy.

A 2021 Employee Benefit Research Institute study found that about 82 percent of employees with access to a retirement plan had more than $25,000 in total savings and investments, and 63 percent had $100,000 or more. However, only 28 percent of those without access to such a plan had over $25,000 saved, and only 9 percent had $100,000 or more.

House Bill 79 would provide the pathway to access through a public-private partnership retirement savings program. The “Work and Save” program would allow those who opt in to save directly through a payroll deduction before they even see their paycheck. Participation would be optional and free for small businesses, employees and even self-employed workers.

How it works, according to the bill:

Each participant’s savings go into an individual retirement account (IRA) created under the program.

By default, it’s a Roth IRA, though participants can later choose a traditional IRA instead.

Contributions are deposited directly from payroll into the employee’s IRA.

The money is professionally managed through private-sector investment managers selected by the North Carolina Small Business Retirement Savings Program Board.

The funds are held in a trust, separate from the state’s general fund. The state, employers and the Board have no ownership of participant contributions or earnings — those belong entirely to the individual account holder.

The bill received a favorable response when presented by bill-sponsor and then-Rep. Jarrod Lowery (R-Lumberton) to a committee at the General Assembly in Raleigh in late June. But it has a long way to go before becoming law.

Lowery announced his resignation from the North Carolina General Assembly on the House floor on Sept. 23. The former member has taken a role with the U.S. Department of Interior, and his brother, John Lowery, has been recommended to serve the remainder of the term.

Down the path of other ‘Work and Saves’

During the hearing of the House Committee on Pensions and Retirement, few questions were raised, but one of them was about other states doing this sort of program.

It turns out 17 have enacted an auto-IRA program, and 11 of those are up and running. The first, Oregon Saves, launched in 2017. The application of the program is working differently in some states, according to AARP.

Oregon Saves enrolled nearly 118,000 people from more than 21,000 businesses, who saved collectively $200 million through the program in 2023, according to a news release by the state.

Across multiple state programs, the total assets in auto-IRA or state-automated savings plans have passed $2 billion as of mid-2025, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives.

The center found that automatic enrollment tends to increase saving behavior among those who would otherwise not opt in, and that opt-outs are relatively low when the process is automatic.

North Carolina’s program would be opt-in, making it different from the 17 states that have programs in place. Therefore, it’s hard to compare what program participation and savings could be in North Carolina.

“I think this is just tremendously good public policy,” said Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Raleigh) during the committee hearing. He then asked whether it could be up and running before the proposed date of July 1, 2027.

Lowery answered that the date had been chosen to give enough time for a public awareness campaign, to get a board in place to oversee it and for creating the actual system to begin taking contributions.

The bill was passed on to the House Committee on Insurance on June 25, but there’s been no movement on the bill since.

Budget ties and savings

While HB79 is on hold, the conversation around it intersects with larger fiscal debates at the General Assembly. Lawmakers haven’t yet come to an agreement on a state budget proposal this year, so they passed a so-called mini-budget in June that funds only critical programs. That limited spending plan left the state’s Medicaid program with a shortfall that’s unresolved, spurring the state Department of Health and Human Services to cut rates to providers to keep the program solvent.

Even as those Medicaid rate cuts take effect, lawmakers are weighing how to balance immediate spending needs with long-term sustainability.

“This proposal, over 10 years, would save Medicaid a half a billion dollars,” said Steven Hahn, North Carolina AARP communications lead. “That's why it's timely now in this current federal debate as states are going to have to pay more. Where are we gonna get the money? Well, let's try to get people to have enough money that they're not collecting Medicaid.”

While helping more North Carolinians save for retirement could, over time, lessen reliance on public assistance programs — it also helps those retirees actually access those “golden years.”

“If you're just betting on Social Security — it's not enough to cover housing, medications and travel right now. And that means that something's gonna have to go lacking,” Lowery said. “If you're not able to cover the cost of housing, the cost of medication, the cost of travel, you're definitely not gonna be able to enjoy life, the fruits of your labor.

“This is the way to get North Carolinians more prepared for retirement, but also help the state's long term fiscal outlook.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a5bfda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2Fa2%2F03a7648d4089b6415f41adb1c9a9%2Fretire.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 20:01:29.832463

Green industrial policy refers to deliberate government strategy designed to reshape economic structures and steer industries toward low-carbon, environmentally sustainable paths. It is not simply about building more factories or generating growth, but about aligning growth with climate goals, social inclusion, and long-term resilience.

Indonesia has recently announced an ambitious plan: to install 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, including 80 gigawatts of distributed solar arrays paired with battery storage in nearly 80,000 villages, managed by village cooperatives (Merah Putih Cooperatives) and 20 gigawatts in centralized solar plants. These village-scale solar plus storage systems are projected to produce electricity at around US$0.12 to $0.15 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years, much cheaper than the $0.20 to $0.40 cost typical of diesel-powered generation in remote areas.

The Rp 200 trillion liquidity injection aims to push state-owned banks to lend more to productive sectors. But unless some of this capital is explicitly directed toward clean energy and industrial transformation, it may miss the chance to support green industrial policy in a substantive way. For example, funds could be used to ease the upfront costs of village solar plants, subsidize battery storage procurement, support domestic manufacturing of solar panels and related components, or offer concessional finance to cooperatives that might otherwise lack credit history or collateral.

Green industrial policy typically addresses market failures: private investors are often cautious about sponsoring high upfront cost technologies whose returns are uncertain. Governments can reduce risk through regulation, incentives, public procurement, or direct investment. By doing this, they can spark innovation, build up local supply chains, foster jobs, and reduce reliance on imported technology. Instruments can include tax incentives, standards or requirements for local content, public-private partnerships, grants or loan guarantees, workforce training, and skills development.

In the context of Indonesia’s rural solar plan, green industrial policy would mean ensuring that the cooperatives have not only finance but also technical training and maintenance capacity; scaling up local production or assembly of solar panels, batteries, inverters, wiring, and mounting systems; enabling policies that lower import or regulatory hold-ups; ensuring regulatory stability so that investors feel confident; and making sure that communities share in the benefits, not just through access to electricity but through economic opportunities. Experts have already flagged gaps: cooperatives may lack technical expertise, governance capacity, and access to commercial funding; there is limited domestic manufacturing capacity; regulatory uncertainty remains an issue; and demand-side stimulus is needed so that banks will find lending attractive rather than remain cautious.

Without anchoring the liquidity injection in green industrial policy, there is a risk that funds will flow into traditional sectors or be used in ways that respond to short-term demand rather than structural transformation. The government must signal clearly that some fraction of the Rp 200 trillion is reserved for green infrastructure and energy transition, including rural solar deployment. Finance ministries, energy ministries, and industry ministries must coordinate so that regulations, incentives, and public procurement align to support solar panels, battery storage, clean energy installers, and cooperative energy governance.

It is also critical to guard against policy flip-flops, because inconsistency discourages investment. Indonesia has experienced regulatory uncertainty around rooftop solar and net metering, which reduced investor confidence. Demonstrating long-term commitment through stable rules, transparent tendering, predictable tariffs or purchase agreements, and mechanisms that require or reward local content will help.

The global audience should take notice. If Indonesia can transform a macroeconomic stimulus into a driver of green industrial policy, it will provide a powerful case study for other emerging economies grappling with climate change and development. The story could become one in which a large liquidity injection does not merely boost demand or consumption but actually retools value chains, empowers rural communities, and reduces carbon emissions in a way that is socially inclusive.

What remains to be decided is whether this liquidity moment will be treated merely as economic relief or as an inflection point. If Purbaya’s injection is steered toward solar villages, clean-energy manufacturing, skills training, and stable regulation, the result could be durable change. Indonesia may then be able to say it used its financial levers not simply to revive credit flows but to invest in its future --both clean and equitable, both industrial and green.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — International automakers are playing a major role in powering Indiana’s economy, according to a new report from Autos Drive America.

The Washington-based advocacy group found that Honda, Subaru, and Toyota have invested a combined $11.8 billion in the Hoosier State, creating 17,339 direct jobs. Together, the companies account for nearly 20% of all vehicles produced by international automakers nationwide.

Subaru’s Lafayette facility, its only plant outside Japan, employs more than 6,500 workers and is expected to produce its 8 millionth vehicle in November. Honda’s Greensburg plant supports about 2,700 jobs and has the capacity to produce 250,000 vehicles annually, while Toyota’s Princeton operation employs roughly 7,600 workers and built more than 328,000 vehicles last year.

Conexus Indiana, which studies the state’s advanced manufacturing and logistics industries, said the automotive sector represents about 20% of Indiana’s total manufacturing GDP. The state is home to 628 automotive companies and ranks second only to Michigan in automotive production. Conexus leaders said Indiana’s diverse workforce and strong supplier network make it attractive for both domestic and foreign manufacturers.

However, the organization warned of workforce shortages, projecting up to 85,000 unfilled manufacturing and logistics positions by 2033.

As automakers shift toward electric and alternative-energy vehicles, Conexus is partnering with Purdue University, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Center for Automotive Research to help Indiana suppliers adapt to new propulsion technologies.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts.
The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis.
Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases.
They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.","The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui Province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers.

That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines emit static electricity that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole.

“As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air-conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a six-inch fish he had just caught.

China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about.

But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions, far from most of its people and factories. More than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid.

Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy.

In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers.

Even before Mr. Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles.

Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries.

The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use.

Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule.

The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared.

“State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai.

In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated.

“To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year.

China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes.

The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than seven million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time.

In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas.

Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41 percent since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away.

For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.

China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information and intolerance for public dissent.

Some villagers in Anhui Province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:34.857112

The CIM Northern Luncheon in North Bay is an event hosted by the CIM Northern Gateway Branch, a local chapter of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. These luncheons bring together professionals from the mining industry to discuss new technologies, network, and hear from expert guest speakers.

Al Guenette, Director of New Technology and R&D NOAM at Sandvik was the key presenter as he discussed integrated bolting solutions at the event held on Wednesday at the Davedi Club in North Bay.

""So basically, it's the integration of ground support, so that's bolts that support tunnels with equipment,"" explained Guenette.

""So it's moving forward technology and helping to have a safer environment for the miners. We've been acquired by Sandvik over four years ago now, so a lot of R&D development has been done to bring both divisions together, to have a better, safer system.""

Tariff impact

It's been a turbulent time, with many industries like mining facing the challenges of dealing with U.S. tariff threats.

Guenette says the mining industry is feeling it.

""With the tariffs, I think that's definitely a big impact on business,"" he admitted.

""So you have to be versatile and flexible. So for us, we have manufacturing in Canada, but we also have manufacturing in multiple regions across the globe. So we get to have the opportunity to bring products from different regions, as well as from here in Canada.

""So the purpose of that is security of supply to ensure there isn't an outage for any of the mines. So we've been working quite hard on that for the last five years.""

Ring of Fire opportunities

But there is optimism with future projects like the Ring of Fire.

""I think everybody's interested in any type of new development and what that would look like, so we're definitely interested as far as the Sandvik equipment side, that they would go first with these types of new projects and we come in after that, so definitely exciting,"" he said.

The Energy Department recently banned several words including “climate change” and “emissions.” Bipartisan-approved renewable energy projects are being canceled. Environmental agencies are being dismantled. Climate science based policies are under attack.

These hostile attacks are using a report of the recently disbanded sham “Climate Working Group,” which was stacked with climate contrarians. The fact is that the fundamental principle of global warming is considered “settled science.” This means it is unlikely to be disproved as it is supported by abundant evidence and credible peer review.

But the current political agenda is putting corporate fossil fool cronies above the common good of the people and the planet. With the blessing of the government, this polluting industry continues to spread disinformation as well as expand their operations. In the midst of these dark times for the environment, Mid Ohio Valley Climate Action (MOVCA) is bringing an impactful, positive event to Wood County.

The event is a display of ten 36″x 30″ portraits which focus on diverse Americans who have struggled for environmental justice. Each portrait has an essential quote made by the subject etched into the painting. The paintings were done by Robert Shetterly of Maine. Shetterly refers to his paintings as “Americans Who Tell The Truth” (AWTT). The individuals are easily recognizable as he is a masterful artist. He also includes interesting biographical information about the individuals portrayed.

Until January 2002, Shetterly had never painted a realistic portrait when he painted the first of the Americans Who Tell The Truth portraits. Now numbering over 280, the portraits travel around the country as models of courageous citizenship. In addition to the loan of his portraits to schools, organizations and other interested groups, Shetterly has published several books which include photos of his portraits, the biographical info and additional essays by well known individuals.

The various volumes focus on Americans, both historic and living, who have struggled for racial, social, economic and other aspects of life in America. To help fund this exhibit, MOVCA received Direct Support Funds, a project of the Mountain Watershed Association. These funds are made possible by Cloud Mountain Foundation, The Plastic Solution Fund, The Heinz Endowments and The 11th Hour Project.

MOVCA’s truth tellers exhibit focuses on Shetterly’s book, Portraits Of Earth Justice and Americans who “…risk everything to live their truth in pursuit of environmental justice for all.” Besides 50 inspiring portraits and biographical information, the book includes essays by Bill McKibben, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Leah Penniman, Bill Bigelow and Diane Wilson.

The 10 portraits chosen for display by MOVCA include a diverse mix of persons; both young and old, female and male. Some are West Virginians.

Information about the exhibit can be viewed online under “Upcoming Events” on AWTT’s website: americanswhotellthetruth.org. The paintings will be hung for exhibition at Wood County’s South Parkersburg Library at 1807 Blizzard Drive. Starting after the library’s regular hours, an opening reception will be held on Oct. 17 from 5-8 p.m. The reception is open to the general public and will include refreshments and a Zoom with the artist from 6-7 p.m.

After the opening, the portraits will be on display for four weeks through Nov. 17. They can be viewed anytime during the South Parkersburg Library’s operating hours which are; Monday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. This would be an interesting field trip appropriate for several grade levels of science or art classes.

AWTT’s website also offers free lesson plans, curriculum and other educational programs to ensure “… that future generations of Americans understand the value and tools of engaged citizenship.”

During the four week time frame, MOVCA is planning a few additional public events that will supplement the exhibit. MOVCA greatly appreciates South Parkersburg Library staff for accommodating the request to use their space for the exhibit, and also for pulling together additional materials that will help enrich it.

These are rough times for the environment and our planet but, now more than ever, these are the most important times to continue to speak truth to power in order to help “Save the Grandchildren.”

Renewable-fuelled plant factories ensure large-scale food supply but require low-carbon transition for environmental gains.","Renewable-fuelled plant factories (RFPFs) represent a revolutionary approach to agriculture, leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance food production while addressing significant environmental concerns. Recent studies emphasize the urgent need for innovative solutions to meet the ever-increasing global demand for food, particularly in densely populated regions. In China, a country facing immense pressure to provide sufficient vegetables for its vast population, RFPFs emerge as a promising solution. These facilities, powered by renewable energy, not only aim to fulfill dietary demands but also seek to do so in an environmentally responsible manner.

Geospatial analysis plays a pivotal role in the deployment of RFPFs across China’s 369 city-level regions. The multidimensional approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the geographic and demographic factors that influence vegetable demand. It assesses not just the potential supply of vegetables but also the infrastructural needs required to create a functioning network of plant factories. This analysis provides a vital roadmap for policymakers and stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding the establishment and location of these sustainable food production systems.

The implementation of RFPFs can yield significant advantages, particularly in a cross-city framework. This approach promotes collaboration between different cities, enhancing the overall efficiency of the food supply chain. By leveraging shared resources and optimizing production capabilities, RFPFs can achieve a remarkable reduction in the land required for traditional agriculture, saving an astounding 51,390 square kilometers of cropland. This not only alleviates pressure on arable land but also contributes to preserving biodiversity and reducing habitat destruction.

However, while RFPFs offer numerous benefits in terms of land use and efficient vegetable production, they are not without challenges. A critical concern is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions associated with their establishment. Studies indicate that RFPFs can emit greenhouse gases at rates 1.99 to 2.55 times higher than conventional agriculture, primarily due to the energy-intensive processes involved in manufacturing power modules and constructing facilities. This dilemma highlights the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes both food production efficiency and environmental sustainability.

Mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with RFPFs is essential for their long-term viability. Transitioning to low-carbon pathways emerges as a critical strategy to address this challenge. By adopting renewable energy sources and incorporating energy-efficient technologies, RFPFs can drastically reduce their carbon footprints. Research demonstrates that implementing low-carbon strategies can lead to a reduction of up to 70% in emissions, paving the way for RFPFs to operate within environmentally sustainable parameters. This transition is crucial not just for compliance with environmental standards but for the overall acceptance and success of RFPFs in the broader agricultural landscape.

As the world grapples with the pressing issue of climate change, the urgency of implementing sustainable agricultural practices becomes increasingly evident. RFPFs stand at the forefront of this agricultural revolution, where innovation and sustainability intersect. They provide an opportunity to rethink traditional food production systems through advanced technologies that can be integrated into urban environments, ultimately reshaping how societies think about agriculture and food supply.

Moreover, the overall cost structure of RFPFs is competitive, standing at an affordable 5.88 Chinese Yuan per kilogram. This aspect underscores the economic viability of renewable-fuelled plant factories. Lower costs combined with sustainable practices can incentivize broader adoption among consumers and investors alike. As urban populations continue to grow, the integration of RFPFs into these areas could transform food distribution networks, making them more efficient and resilient against external shocks, such as pandemics or climate-induced disasters.

The urgency of adopting RFPFs is particularly pressing given the backdrop of increasing food insecurity. With global populations expected to rise significantly in the coming decades, ensuring sufficient food supply chains is paramount. RFPFs can serve as a critical buffer against food shortages, especially in urban settings where space is limited and traditional agricultural methods are impractical. They offer a scalable solution that can be tailored to meet local needs while minimizing the ecological footprint of food production.

In addition to their practical benefits, RFPFs also present an opportunity for community engagement and education. By positioning these facilities within urban areas, they can serve as educational hubs, promoting awareness about food production, sustainability, and the importance of reducing individual carbon footprints. Engaging local communities in the operations of RFPFs can foster a culture of sustainability and encourage collective efforts toward environmental stewardship.

Despite the promise that RFPFs hold for the future of food production, their successful implementation will hinge upon collaborative efforts among various stakeholders. Governments, academic institutions, and private enterprises must work together to develop the necessary regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and technological support to create an ecosystem conducive to the growth of these facilities. Research institutions can play a crucial role in advancing the technology behind RFPFs and providing critical insights into their ecological impacts and operational efficiencies.

In summary, renewable-fuelled plant factories represent a vital innovation in the quest for sustainable food production. They offer numerous benefits, including significant land savings and competitive pricing, but also pose challenges related to greenhouse gas emissions. The path forward involves a commitment to low-carbon transitions and collaborative efforts across multiple sectors. Moving ahead, it is clear that RFPFs could transform agriculture as we know it, enabling societies to produce food more sustainably while also addressing the pressing challenges posed by climate change and urbanization.

Therefore, embracing this approach not only aligns with the objectives of sustainable development but also ensures that future generations can enjoy food security in a rapidly changing world. With the right strategies in place, renewable-fuelled plant factories may well signify the future of efficient, resilient food production systems, paving the way for a new chapter in how we cultivate and consume food globally.

Energy prices are intertwined with inflation, which further clouds our stagflationary picture Trump is painting right now.","One tiny problem, outside the fact that the four biggest wind power producing states all voted for Trump by an average of 19 percent in 2024, is that Trump’s own government data doesn’t back up that assertion. “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data,” reported Politico. Energy prices across the country right now are surging, up 30 percent on average since 2020 and double the rate of inflation over the last year. There is no one singular cause to this trend that precedes Trump 2.0, but his war on renewable energy certainly isn’t helping to create the supply that increasing demand from things like AI data centers are placing on the grid.

Trump’s tariffs are raising energy costs too, as his desire to make things in America requires parts made elsewhere. “Long-term costs for utility-scale energy storage projects would increase anywhere from 12 percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the [tariff] scenario,” said data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie to Utility Dive earlier this year.

This war waged on clean energy is hitting red states, as an analysis by Energy Innovation of the GOP bill found that energy bills in Republican-leaning states could rise by more than $600 every year, and energy prices across the country could see their energy bill rise by as much as 18 percent by 2035. This study found that “Bills in Missouri will spike the most, by $640 a year, with the next largest increases – in Kentucky, South Carolina, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Texas,” as The Guardian noted in their writeup of it earlier this year. All states that voted for Trump in part because their energy bills were too high. He’s only raised them since coming into office.

Politico’s analysis of EIA data found that “U.S. power prices rose an average of 23.4 percent from June 2021 to June of this year,” and just yesterday the Trump administration decided to further immiserate their own voters by abruptly canceling a massive solar project in Nevada, another state that voted for Trump in November. Heatmap reported that the Esmeralda 7 solar project, delivering a massive 6.2 gigawatts of power to the state, was canceled seemingly out of nowhere last night. To put that figure in perspective, the Hoover Dam has a power capacity of 2 gigawatts. They canceled three Hoover Dam’s worth of energy just like that. This will raise energy bills in Nevada.

This is basic economics Trump never learned in the economics 101 class I strongly believe he never showed up to. The economy and the people who live in it demand energy to run our lives, and if there is not enough supply of energy, it will cost more. Energy prices are intertwined with inflation, which further clouds our stagflationary picture Trump is painting right now. He is depressing growth by raising energy prices and adding a surcharge on to every import while threatening to raise tariffs on China again today, all while destroying the labor market with his racist immigration policy which all combine to have the net result of potentially lowering the baseline growth we can expect from a damaged American economy.",https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2025/10/Harvest_the_Wind_IA_7-13_13901366435-windmill.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:39.525987

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power.
Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.
“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).","A recent report estimates that New Mexico has the potential to produce substantial power from its geothermal resources.

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?

Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.

This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.

This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.

Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.

“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.

He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.

That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.

Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.

Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.

“The really exciting possibility is what's called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.

Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.

“Meaning you don't have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.

Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.

Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.

Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.

In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.

There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.

The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.

By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.

Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.

“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).

Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.

“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”

New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.

In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.

Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.

“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we're hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.

Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.

At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.

“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We've got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”

A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.

“I think it's a hell of an idea, but it's a ways out,” Woods said.

Woods is clear: he doesn’t want to replace oil and gas anytime soon. For now it keeps crucial dollars flowing to his constituents in the far northeastern stretch of the state.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/881715d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5152x2705+0+580/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2F13%2F79988cd041a3951a0240d6da4b88%2F29206586324-7341aeaffb-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:24.446412

Laura Sherman is head of the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, which advocates for renewable energy.

She said the state's electricity demand is going to rise swiftly, and renewable energy generation will be better able to keep up than fossil fuel sources.

""Some of the new electric load we'll have is going to be gradual as we electrify homes, buildings, transportation,"" she said. ""But some of it's going to be really fast. Data centers can be built very, very, very quickly. Once you break ground, a wind or solar plant be in place within the six- to eight-month range. A natural gas plant might take five to seven years.""

Sherman said she expects both DTE Energy and Consumers Energy will meet the intermediate goals set in Michigan's long-term energy plan, for 50% renewable electricity by 2030, and 60% by 2035. The long-term goal is 100% clean energy by 2040.

A Consumers Energy statement said the MPSC approved its updated renewable energy plan last month, which proposes to add up to 9,000 MW of solar energy resources, and up to 2,800 MW of wind capacity.

""These actions will enable Consumers Energy to achieve 60% renewable energy by 2035 and 100% clean energy by 2040. We will be filing our updated Integrated Resource Plan, our long-term energy supply blueprint, with the Michigan Public Service Commission next year,"" the company said.

In a statement, DTE Energy said it is on track to meet the 50% renewable energy target in five years.

""Since 2009, DTE has invested $4.6 billion in renewable energy infrastructure, and we plan to invest an additional $4 billion over the next several years – building approximately 900 megawatts of renewables per year on average over the next five years,"" the statement said.

The Kohler plant in Brownwood opened its doors in 1975 and has provided three generations of local residents with job opportunities, Brownwood Mayor Stephen Haynes said among his comments.
It says something when you make a commitment to do something, but the commitment Kohler has made goes beyond that.
“Brownwood has continually improved itself, developing quality products, cultivating a safe and engage workforce, and serving as a cornerstone for Kohler manufacturing globally.”","Kohler marked the 50th anniversary of its Brownwood plant with a ceremony Friday afternoon, during which the company announced a new venture locally – an 80-acre solar energy project.

Brian Benson, Senior Director of Global Vitreous Operations based out of the Brownwood plant, told those in attendance, “This year, in a partnership with the Brownwood Industrial Foundation, Kohler Company has signed a letter of intent to acquire 80 acres of land adjacent to the Kohler manufacturing facility, of which 20 acres will be used for a large scale solar energy project. The initiative aims to transform the vacant land into a productive, environmentally sustainable asset, creating jobs and stimulating the local economy. The project will enhance grid efficiency and generate sizable tax revenue that will support the local schools and public services. This investment will be Kohler’s largest solar installation in the United States to date as we continue to focus on building both business and community resilience. Renewable energy will alleviate grid pressure in the Brownwood community and promote resilience for Kohler’s operations.”

The project – which will be located between Milam Drive and FM 45 – will be executed in phases, Benson continued, with the first 20 acres producing 9 million kilowatts of clean energy annually. Future phases will expand the system to cover additional load and battery storage.

Kohler will secure the land through an in-kind donation totaling $50,000 to three local companies – the United Way, the VFW Post 3278, and the Ark Domestic Shelter, which will help fund a new roof for its facility, according to Benson.

The Kohler plant in Brownwood opened its doors in 1975 and has provided three generations of local residents with job opportunities, Brownwood Mayor Stephen Haynes said among his comments.

“The people who work at this plant are the heart and soul of our community,” Haynes said. “There isn’t anyone in Brownwood who doesn’t have a friend, family member or knows a valued member of the community that works here at this plant. These folks are an invaluable part of our community and they do a great job.”

Haynes continued, “We also want to give praise to the corporate executives that have made the decision to be here in Brownwood and made the decision to remain here. That is not lost on me. It says something when you make a commitment to do something, but the commitment Kohler has made goes beyond that. We see and hear and know that they’re investing and re-investing continually into this community and plant, which says they have a future here and plan to remain here, and we’re so thankful for that commitment.”

Haynes read a proclamation to mark Kohler’s anniversary, which including the following details:

The Brownwood division currently produces more than 560,000 pieces a year with plans to grow that number to over 2 million

Kohler’s plastic division produces 280,000 units annually, encompassing over 200 unique products

Kohler’s Brownwood plant plays a key role in the global supply chain, shipping over 100,000 units monthly across the United States into international destinations such as Saudi Arabia, China and England

The Brownwood facility is the exclusive global producer of pressure vessel tanks for Kohler Company

Kohler Brownwood was recently honored as the top-ranked American distribution site for achieving 100 percent on-time delivery

Adriana Stowers, on behalf of the office of Gov. Greg Abbott, said, “For half a century this facility has been more than just a workplace. It has been a cornerstone of the local economy, a partner in community growth, and a place where generations of hard-working Texans have built not only world-class products, but also lasting careers and friendships. Kohler’s commitment to innovation and sustainability, as well as to the people of Brownwood and the surrounding region, speaks to the very best of Texas values, hard work, resilience, and pride in craftsmanship.”

Heath Holtz, Chief Operations & Supply Chain Officer for Kohler, shared some of the history of the Brownwood plant, including:

In 1975, Kohler launched a pilot program for vitreous china production beginning with just 14 local associates and a handful of transfers from other sites

By 1979, Kohler expanded by 200,000 square feet to support fiberglass, reinforced plastic bathing modules

In 1982, another 604,000 square feet were added to meet growing demand

This past year, Kohler invested millions in automation, advanced equipment and cutting-edge manufacturing, ensuring that Brownwood remains at the forefront of the industry and a key producer in leading-edge bathing products for the next 50 years

Holtz also recognized 407 Brownwood members in Kohler’s quarter-century club, with two employees – Fernando Barrera and Richard Salinas – having worked at the plant for 47 years apiece.

“Above all the products that we ship and what we’ve invested in the plant, today is about the people – the associates who have built their careers here, many with decades of service and dedication,” Holtz said. “Brownwood has continually improved itself, developing quality products, cultivating a safe and engage workforce, and serving as a cornerstone for Kohler manufacturing globally.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1378/2025/10/10153948/img_3449-1024x577.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:30.371292

“This modification will avoid potential short-term disruptions to the LNG sector while promoting investments in U.S. shipbuilding capacity and production of LNG vessels,” the Office of the US Trade Representative said in a notice on Friday.

The provision, which is effective immediately, would have allowed the US to suspend LNG export licenses for companies that failed to meet requirements for shipping fuel on US-built LNG tankers starting in the second half of the decade. American LNG companies warned that existing shipbuilding capacity in the US is not equipped to churn out specialized LNG tankers, which are mainly built in South Korea and Japan.

Included in the notice on Friday is a proposal to levy additional tariffs of up to 150% on certain Chinese-origin cargo handling equipment, like the gantry cranes, straddle carriers and container-stacking tractors widely used at American seaport terminals. The USTR said it would accept comments on that and other related proposals until Nov. 10.

The move comes two days after Cenovus sweetened its offer for MEG, its neighbour in Alberta's oilsands. Strathcona also has operations in the region.

""As a result of the revised arrangement agreement between the MEG board of directors and Cenovus Energy Inc., Strathcona believes the conditions to its offer, or any reasonably improved offer, are no longer capable of being satisfied,"" Strathcona said in a release Friday.

Strathcona owns 14.2 per cent of MEG and had been offering 0.80 of one of its shares for each MEG share it did not already own.

The latest Cenovus offer announced Wednesday values MEG at $8.6 billion, including assumed debt and is made up of half equity and half stock. Its earlier offer had been three-quarters cash, and some MEG shareholders had pushed to get a bigger slice of the post-takeover company.

""While Strathcona is disappointed with this outcome, it is pleased that its actions, along with those of its fellow MEG shareholders, delivered something which the MEG board could not, namely a more equitable transaction with Cenovus which allows MEG shareholders to participate more meaningfully in future upside,"" Strathcona said.

The new plant, situated at the anaerobic digestion site of Srinivas Waste Management Services (SWMS) in Chetpet, Chennai, transforms organic municipal waste into high-purity renewable gas.

The project’s completion aligns with the current UK-India trade mission, highlighting three decades of Clarke Energy’s presence in the region. With nearly 2 GW of installed low-carbon and renewable power systems across India and Bangladesh, the company continues to be a key player in UK-India commercial and energy collaboration.

At the SWMS facility, biodegradable food waste from surrounding communities is processed into biogas and nutrient-rich compost, contributing to both local sustainability and national environmental goals.

This installation supports India’s SATAT program, which aims to establish 5,000 compressed biogas (CBG) plants across the country. Clarke Energy’s system uses membrane separation to upgrade 600 Nm³/hr of raw biogas into clean biomethane—demonstrating a scalable, efficient, and locally sourced solution for meeting the nation’s renewable fuel ambitions.

Replacing older pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, the new membrane system includes a biogas dryer, scrubber, compressor, dual-stage membrane unit, and all necessary controls and piping. Most of the equipment was sourced from Indian manufacturers, helping ensure faster deployment and reducing environmental impact.

Early operational results show strong performance, with methane purity levels surpassing 97.4% even under partial load, while also minimizing methane loss during processing.

“This is the first biogas upgrading solution we’ve fully designed, built, and commissioned in India,” said Kyle Quinn, President of Clarke Energy. “It’s a major achievement that shows how we’re blending global know-how with local delivery to support India’s energy transition with reliable, high-efficiency systems.”

Unlike traditional PSA systems, the membrane-based design achieves greater methane recovery, lower maintenance demands, and modular scalability—well-suited for cities converting waste to fuel.

The project also reflects Rehlko’s strategy of building regionally focused, sustainable infrastructure. Through Clarke Energy and other portfolio companies, Rehlko continues to back clean technology and circular economy innovations that are tailored to local needs.

The reality? GM isn’t scaling back its hydrogen efforts. It’s thinking bigger.

The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.

MARK TWAIN (sort of)

Like the great Sam Clemens, there seems to be plenty of confidence in the greater automotive press that GM’s decision to cancel a $55 millions fuel cell plant on the former Michigan State Fairgrounds site in Detroit. That plant, a JV with Southeast Michigan’s Piston Automotive, would have created ~140 jobs and built compact hydrogen fuel cells for light- and medium-duty vehicles under the Hydrotec brand.

That plan, frankly, was never going to work. It was always a cynical incentive grab and the first fruits of GM’s Hydrotec efforts were so laughably far behind the state of the electric art that the facts themselves blurred the line between satire and reality. Which, of course, didn’t matter – as long as the incentive money (Biden’s Department of Energy awarded GM $30 million in grants for the State Fairgrounds plant) kept flowing.

The new Trump Administration put an end to that flow last week, however, terminating 321 financial awards for clean energy worth $7.56 billion.

“Certainly the decisions of the DOE are an element of that overall climate but not the only driver,” explained GM spokesperson, Stuart Fowle, in a statement. “We want to prioritize the engineering talent and resources and everything we have to continuing to advance EVs given hydrogen is in a different spot.”

That spot is heavy-duty, off-highway, maritime, and data centers.

Bigger trucks, bigger fuel cells

Instead of dying, GM is continuing on the hydrogen fuel cell it’s been on for literal decades – with no plans (publicly, at least) to shutter its Fuel Cell System Manufacturing joint-venture with Honda in Brownstown Township, MI.

That company is not just developing HFCs, they’re out there selling fuel cells today, to extreme-duty, disaster response, and off-highway equipment customers operating far enough off the grid that access to electricity is questionable and to data center developers for whom access to a continuous flow of energy is mission-critical.

Electrek’s Take

Fuel cells like the ones from GM and Honda will continue to seem like a good idea … for about as long as it takes the heavy equipment guys to watch a ZQUIP video.

As part of the deal, Colorado's Spruce Power is working with Carolina's EnerWealth Solutions, a solar development business, to offer panel and battery storage leasing in the state.
Spruce is the owner and operator of distributed solar energy assets across the country, according to a news release.
For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology.

For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology. There's also typically no maintenance or end-of-lease panel removal concerns with the contracts, according to Palmetto, another North Carolina company that offers leases.

""We believe solar energy should be accessible and affordable to all and are committed to bringing clean energy opportunities to homeowners through our offering of the first solar plus storage lease in North Carolina. We appreciate that Spruce Power customized a servicing solution to meet our needs,"" EnerWealth CEO Ajulo Othow said in the statement.

Batteries provide stored electricity for later use, and even to charge electric vehicles. Customers can even sell it back to the grid, depending on plans and programs available in the area, and the lease agreement.

Leasing is also a great way to limit the electricity needed from dirty fuels that cause planet-warming air pollution. NASA has linked the gases to greater risks for extreme heat that could soon leave some places uninhabitable.

It's all good news for energy-savvy Tar Heel homeowners, as well as for the industry as a whole. Federal solar tax incentives expire at the end of the year, but Investing.com reported that Spruce was enjoying solid stock market performance earlier this month when the partnership with EnerWealth was announced.

It's also important for customers to understand the benefits of both leasing and buying. EnergySage said that an array can cost around $30,000 on average, before credits. EnergySage is a free online resource that can help customers compare quotes, find the right installer, and secure all the rebates before they are gone. Fast action can save up to $10,000 when buying a system.

Palmetto — in the business for more than 16 years — has a great guide that lists pros and cons for leasing and buying. It offers leases through LightReach and has more than 500,000 accounts. It's important to know your options to make the best decision. If you plan on selling your home soon, leasing likely isn't the best option, for example.

In North Carolina, Spruce ""will deliver the operational infrastructure that enables EnerWealth to scale rapidly while maintaining exceptional homeowner experiences,"" according to the release.

Billing, collections, support, and remote monitoring are all part of Spruce's expertise, proved by having managed 145,000 ""residential solar assets"" around the country, the statement continued.

They also underscore what Dr Al Dahak sees as the UAE’s dual commitment, economic growth that is “pro-climate” rather than extractive.
“We are blessed with a rapidly growing economy,” Dr Al Dahak said, “but that growth is also creating more opportunities for conservation”.
Innovation, Dr Al Dahak noted, is a necessity in a desert nation.","The UAE's Minister of Climate Change and Environment has hailed the country's hosting of a major global conservation conference this week as a “significant milestone” in its quest to help safeguard the planet.

Dr Amna Al Dahak said the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress – being held in Abu Dhabi until October 15 – served as an opportunity for the Emirates to demonstrate its rich biodiversity and environmental history and show that environmental strategies and economic development can go hand-in-hand.

The event has brought together about 10,000 delegates from more than 140 countries, including government officials, scientists, campaigners and indigenous leaders to set the global conservation agenda.

The congress was established in 1948 and has been held in all parts of the world, from Barcelona and Buenos Aires to Nairobi and New Delhi.

This year marks the first time it has been hosted in the Gulf. It was staged in the Middle East, in Jordan, in 2000.

Historic moment

For Dr Al Dahak, the event reflects the UAE’s ambition to position itself as a “global convening power” on environmental issues.

“It’s not just about hosting,” she told The National. “It’s about translating collective ambition into action on the ground. The UAE is always about action.”

“From our founding father Sheikh Zayed, we’ve had a philosophy where man and environment are integrated – where prosperity and preservation are inseparable,” said Dr Al Dahak.

The congress, follows a string of high-profile environmental milestones for the UAE, including hosting Cop28 in Dubai in 2023.

The IUCN gathering offers a chance to highlight the country’s natural heritage, often overlooked in global conversations about the Middle East.

Hidden riches in an arid land

“The international community doesn’t realise how rich the UAE is in biodiversity,” Dr Al Dahak said. “Yes, it’s an arid environment, but within our seas, mountains, and mangroves, there is extraordinary life.”

A recent project, conducted with IUCN support, identified nine Key Biodiversity Areas across the Emirates, from coral reefs and desert ecosystems to mountain habitats. About 98 per cent of those areas are already protected under national legislation.

Among them is the Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi, home to the world’s largest population of dugongs after Australia. The UAE is home to 80 per cent of Gulf's seagrass meadows. “That’s what sustains our dugong population,” said Dr Al Dahak.

Such statistics challenge common perceptions of the Emirates as a land of sand dunes and skyscrapers. They also underscore what Dr Al Dahak sees as the UAE’s dual commitment, economic growth that is “pro-climate” rather than extractive.

Growth without sacrifice

The minister rejects the idea that conservation and development are incompatible. “From the beginning, the UAE set the priority that the economy must grow with the environment, not at its expense,” she said. “You don’t have to make a trade-off.”

Policies like the Circular Economy Strategy reflect that approach, aiming to align economic diversification with sustainability.

The country’s renewable energy portfolio, including the vast Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, have become a regional model. “We are blessed with a rapidly growing economy,” Dr Al Dahak said, “but that growth is also creating more opportunities for conservation”.

Restoring and innovating for the future

At the UAE pavilion, the story of the nation’s conservation journey is told through three themes – conservation, restoration, and innovation.

Restoration has long been central to the UAE’s environmental policy. The country leads global efforts to reintroduce endangered species, such as the Arabian oryx, once extinct in the wild, and collaborates with nations as far afield as Chad to restore other at-risk animals.

Meanwhile, the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund has supported projects in more than 170 countries, funding conservationists working to protect threatened flora and fauna.

Innovation, Dr Al Dahak noted, is a necessity in a desert nation. “We’ve faced challenges of heat, salinity, and water scarcity,” she said.

“We couldn’t achieve what we have without innovation.” From satellite monitoring of coral reefs to drone-assisted mangrove planting, the UAE is investing in technologies to accelerate conservation impact.

Educating the next generation

Perhaps Dr Al Dahak’s most passionate focus is education. A former educator herself, she says that every environmentalist must also be an educator. “If we want to sustain the outcomes of IUCN or any international platform, we must equip the next generation to carry that torch,” she said. “Conservation isn’t a one time effort, it’s a continuous learning process.”

Initiatives such as Plant the Emirates, a nationwide campaign combining community action with reforestation and eco-tourism programmes that introduce residents to lesser known natural sites have helped raise public awareness.

A shared responsibility

As the congress continues, Dr Al Dahak hopes delegates leave Abu Dhabi with a deeper understanding of both the UAE’s biodiversity and its belief that environmental stewardship is a shared duty. “It’s not the responsibility of governments alone,” she said. “It’s everyone’s, every individual, every parent. This is how we ensure the planet’s story continues.”",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/O5TYA6MMSRD7NO4BHVZEZQJYRU.jpg?smart=true&auth=7630895a5da1606df9422d04e27b6307491eb32b3c241dc008002ca8b2bfdf52&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-11 15:01:07.749856

Critical minerals investment company TechMet Ltd. is setting up a new trading unit to focus on specialty metals after getting additional financing from partner Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.

The unit, TechMet SCM, aims to build a trading platform to serve the rapidly growing demand for critical minerals, according to a statement on Wednesday. It will manage production from the parent company’s critical minerals assets and third-party producers. TechMet’s shareholders include the US International Development Finance Corp.

The move comes as Western nations are racing to challenge China’s dominance in critical minerals. As part of a broader effort to boost US production of the materials, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March invoking emergency presidential powers to fast-track the development of new metals and mining projects.

“There’s so much interest in specialty metals which are needed for economic growth, whether that’s batteries, defense or data centers and AI,” Quentin Lamarche, chief executive officer of TechMet SCM, said in an interview. “We need to have those metals sourced in a legitimate and transparent manner and that’s why we’re aiming to create a structure that can walk the talk on this.”

TechMet and Mercuria have co-invested in several projects and ran a joint venture trading business for several years. In the past year, Mercuria has made a big push into metals — trading copper, aluminum and zinc. While the two firms will continue to look at investments together, it made sense for TechMet to operate a specialty metals and minerals business itself, Lamarche said.

The trading arm plans to expand its global footprint with teams in South Korea, Western Europe and Washington DC, according to the statement. The company is hiring a trader in Washington, Lamarche said.

“We’re operating in a business where geopolitics is heavily intertwined with business and that makes us fairly unique,” Lamarche said. “We’re very close to the policymakers having this office in DC — we believe it’s a strategic differentiator.”

While the amount of the additional investment from Mercuria wasn’t disclosed, the statement said it would bring the energy trading house’s total investment in the firm this year to $68 million, solidifying its position as one of TechMet’s biggest investors.

Three years ago I wrote about a member of the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation named Theresa “Betty” Billiot. She reminisced about how the area around her Louisiana home was once filled with cattle grazing in pastures, cotton fields, and wild prairie dotted with duck ponds. That strong memory is fleeting, as today a rising sea is all that comes into view out that same door. Flood relocation became necessary.

Isle de Jean Charles was the first US location where the federal government funded a climate-driven relocation project. Future homes were envisioned as energy efficient; able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds; well-insulated in the walls, ceiling, and under floors; supplied with certified energy-efficient appliances; and, compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Yet former island residents like Billiot aren’t happy. They describe their new homes as substandard. Rain seeps through doorways. Malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards force costly repairs.

These 37 flood refugees are not alone. Did you know that there are an estimated 2.5 million US residents who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years? A whole lotta planning needs to take place between now and then. Breaking up tightly-knit communities, land-use decisions about geographic flood relocation sites, property pricing equations, and ensuring the constitutionality of property rights all will need to be addressed.

And where in these discussions of climate victims is the fossil fuel industry, which has caused the catastrophe?

Hold the Fossil Fuel Industry Accountable for Sea Level Rise

Sea level rise is the most profound long-term impact of the climate crisis.

Rising sea levels driven by the climate crisis are overwhelming many of the world’s coastlines and waterways. Fossil fuel burning, which causes global heating, is to blame. Recent scientific studies show 1 meter (3.28′) of sea level rise is now inevitable within a century or so — and it could come as early as 2070 if ice sheets collapse and emissions are not curbed. An even more catastrophic rise of 3 meters is probably inevitable in the next millennium or two, scientists say, and could arrive as soon as the early 2100s.

With each additional degree of warming, we will witness more deadly, irreparable, and ruinous impacts from climate change. Democratic lawmakers in a dozen states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. A new study published in Nature offers a framework to potentially strengthen such legal arguments by enabling plaintiffs to calculate contributions made by individual companies to rising temperatures, tying their emissions directly to extreme heat disasters.

Yet the White House is looking the other way. FEMA is under attack by the self-serving Trump administration. As NWF notes, it is often state agencies and programs that are primarily responsible for identifying impacted communities, initiating conversations with those communities, and, ultimately, collaborating with those communities to advance relocation efforts.

The Case Study of the Isle de Jean Charles

Coastal wetlands in southern Louisiana provide essential ecosystem services including reducing inland flooding, controlling erosion, and serving as natural habitat. A particular case can be made that Louisiana’s malpractices in the petrochemical sector, high cancer concentrations in these “Cancer Corridors,” and wetland demise are interconnected.

Economic prioritization (read: fossil fuel industry profitability) has led to wetland demise and destruction of livelihoods.

The Isle de Jean Charles is a narrow ridge situated in the southeastern Louisiana wetlands. Longtime inhabitants are indigenous peoples — the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s. Reliant on the natural surroundings for sustenance — think crabbing, shrimping, fishing, hunting, and agriculture — the inhabitants of the Isle hold a strong sense of place as identity markers.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres. Now it has just 320 acres due primarily to sea level rise caused by the fossil fuel-industry and their secondary effects of erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, and human-made canals.

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government. The move carried with it unsettling reminders of the forced displacement of this community’s ancestors during the Indian Removal Act of 1830.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the US. The state also has a greater likelihood to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years, as revealed by the nonprofit Climate Central.

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, titled, Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline.

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

Flaccid Flood Relocation Blueprints

Changing precipitation patterns, droughts, land degradation, flood events, and sea-level rise already affect many coastal socio-ecological systems. US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) says the rising seas present coastal homeowners with “a continually degrading situation.”

New settlements, at first glance, seem to offer more stable habitats, enhanced protection from food insecurity, expanded access to public resources, and improved healthcare. Yet the framing of resettlements as strictly an adaptive measure fails to take into account place-based attachments, such as deep connections to the land and historical memories. Moreover, the process all-too-often characterizes climate refugees as resilient and willing participants — when their buy-in to the flood relocation may not have been sought nor personally desired.

“It made us angry,” Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation, told Floodlight News. “We thought we were going to have a community, and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

Climate-induced, community-scale resettlements during the 21st century had been largely determined to be unsuccessful by those who moved. Scholars interpret flood relocation to be a result of unequal power dynamics; planning gaps need to address careful and inclusive engagement of those who would be moved.

The US Government Accountability Office has confirmed that the US has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way. Federal programs generally are not designed to address the scale and complexity of community relocation and generally fund acquisition of properties at high risk of damage from disasters in response to a specific event such as a hurricane, according to a 2020 report to Congressional requesters.

Isle de Jean Charles today is largely abandoned. Because the owners demanded continued access to their property after resettlement, however, an occasional former full-time resident visits their Isle de Jean Charles property for a night or two. Maintaining such land access allows continuity of place. It also prevents marginalization, colonization, and exploitation from powerful developers, Tharakan and Neef outline in the (2024) De Gruyter Handbook of Climate Migration and Climate Mobility Justice.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/flood-relocation.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 09:59:20.589893

Governor Maura Healey and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll teamed up with UMass Lowell to blueprint the state’s takeover of advanced nuclear and fusion power, promising a jolt of clean energy for grids and industries alike, jobs, and economic rocket fuel.

Massachusetts’ fresh push for nuclear power hits at a pivotal moment: The offshore wind sector—long a darling of state Democrats—now grapples with mounting delays, including a postponed Round 5 solicitation pushed back to at least 2026 amid federal permitting chaos.

The Trump administration has piled on the pressure, starting with a January moratorium on all new offshore wind leases, followed by rule overhauls favoring fossil fuels, revoked project approvals, and the cancellation of $679 million in manufacturing and port funding.

A wave of uncertainty is sweeping through America’s Battery Belt. Major electric vehicle factory projects are facing delays and potential downsizing. This shift follows changing federal policies and slower-than-expected consumer adoption of EVs.

Communities that bet their economic futures on these massive investments are now grappling with the consequences. The situation highlights the complex interplay between government policy, market forces, and regional economic development.

Planned Capacity Vastly Outpaces Projected EV Demand

A Reuters review of industry plans reveals a significant looming overcapacity. By 2030, planned battery plants could support production for 13 to 15 million electric vehicles annually. This figure comes from research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

However, market analysts at S&P Global Mobility predict a much different reality. They forecast U.S. production of only around 3 million EVs that year. This creates a potential gulf of roughly 10 million vehicles worth of unused battery factory capacity.

Policy Changes and Market Realities Hit Heartland Communities

The recent expiration of a key $7,500 federal EV tax credit has intensified these challenges. Automakers like Ford have publicly predicted a significant drop in electric car sales. This has led to repeated delays at sites like its Stanton, Tennessee complex.

The fallout is deeply felt in small towns. Local leaders who championed these projects now face resident concerns about whether promised jobs will ever materialize. Some hope companies will repurpose the massive sites if EV demand does not rebound.

The future of the Battery Belt now hinges on market adaptation. Automakers may pivot to hybrid production or other technologies. The region’s economic trajectory remains a critical story to follow.

Info at your fingertips

What is the Battery Belt?

The Battery Belt refers to a swath of new EV and battery factories across the U.S. heartland. It stretches from Georgia to Indiana and includes over two dozen major projects.

Why are these battery plants being delayed?

Delays are primarily due to slower-than-expected consumer demand for electric vehicles. Recent changes in federal incentive policies have also contributed to the slowdown.

Which major automakers have delayed projects?

Ford has repeatedly delayed its EV truck plant in Stanton, Tennessee. Hyundai’s massive Georgia project also faced a recent setback due to a federal raid, causing additional delays.

How are local communities affected by these delays?

Small towns that anticipated thousands of new jobs and economic revitalization are now facing uncertainty. Local development and construction tied to these projects have also slowed.

Could these plants be used for other purposes?

Industry experts suggest some facilities could be repurposed for hybrid vehicle production or energy storage systems if the pure EV market does not recover as projected.

House Bill 1260, sponsored by Rep. Joshua Seigel, D-Allentown, was debated in the House Energy Committee on Monday. The bill would require new warehouses to be built solar-ready and create tax incentives for retrofitting existing ones. A similar proposal is being drafted in the Senate.

Advocates argued that commercial rooftop solar offers a rapidly deployed, cost-effective way to expand energy generation while creating revenue streams for developers.

While not completely opposed to the idea, some committee members voiced concerns about mandates amounting to government overreach and suggested incentives would be a better approach.

Pennsylvania ranks eighth in the nation for the number of warehouses, and development continues to grow thanks to its proximity to major East Coast cities and robust transportation networks.

Seigel, in his cosponsorship memo, noted that 44 million square feet of industrial and warehouse space has been approved in Lehigh and Northampton counties alone in the past nine years.

Rob Bair, president of the PA Building and Construction Trades Council, testified that nearly half of all warehouse space in the state, 45.4%, lies along the Route 81 and 78 corridors.

“When you add York and Lancaster counties, that number goes to 54.4%,” he said. “We’re building warehouses along those corridors and employing a lot of people in those jobs. But we have a lot of roof space just sitting there doing nothing – we can put it to use.”

Bair said rooftop solar is low-impact, quick to deploy, and offers an added revenue stream by allowing developers to lease roof space for panels.

“And so, we’re killing a lot of birds with one stone here,” he said.

He also acknowledged concerns about large solar projects taking up farmland and forested areas, but noted that property owners have the right to lease their land as they see fit.

Rep. Jamie Barton, R-Tamaqua, questioned the difference between farmers’ rights to use their land freely while requiring warehouse developers to build solar-ready structures – a concern echoed by Reps. Martin Causer, R-Coudersport and Mike Armanini, R-DuBois, who also raised concerns about the potential cost burden on business owners.

Committee Chair Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, D-Philadelphia, stated that a commercial construction firm with decades-long experience provided her with an estimate indicating that making a 50,000-square-foot warehouse solar-ready would increase costs by less than 1%.

Rep. Paul Friel, D-Pottstown, noted that building codes are mandates designed for public benefit and believed the proposal would not be out of line. Still, he agreed with others that builders need a clear return on investment.

Large companies are already adopting solar-ready designs because they see that return, said Victoria Moroney, director of market development at ForeFront Power. She explained that solar developers can help warehouse owners monetize rooftops through power purchase agreements or leasing arrangements.

Commercial rooftop solar, she added, makes efficient use of land and generates power close to where it’s needed – reducing the need for costly transmission and distribution system upgrades and benefitting Pennsylvania ratepayers. It creates good family-sustaining jobs and comes online quickly, “which is something we urgently need right now with the PJM capacity crisis.”

The lack of solar energy in the commonwealth has contributed to higher electricity costs, said Penn Future’s Pat McDonnell. He noted that 60% of the state’s electricity is generated by gas and less than 5% from renewables.

He also said that recent hikes in Pennsylvanians’ utility bills – averaging about 15% – were partly due to gas plant failures during winter storm Elliot in 2022, and PJM’s capacity auction prices.

McDonnell pointed to Texas, now leading the nation in solar, wind, and battery development, where consumers are seeing lower energy bills.

“The time to use renewable energy is now,” he said. “It’s the cheapest form of electricity we can put on the grid, and we want to put policies in place that make full use of impervious surfaces to take advantage of an obvious opportunity to deal with energy and the climate.”

A 2023 PennEnvironment report said Pennsylvania’s 16,000-plus warehouses offer more than 516 million square feet of potential solar space – enough to generate power for more than 820,000 homes while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

There was broad agreement among participants that a balanced energy portfolio is essential in meeting the state’s needs – one that includes solar, natural gas, nuclear, wind and other sources.

“There is no magic bullet,” said Bair. And, although he expects some amendments to the bill, he welcomes the conversations about bringing new power to the grid quickly to help ease shortages.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.sungazette.com/images/2025/10/10130200/11SolarWarehouse-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:50.825099

This milestone helps to showcase their commitment to sustainable innovation, while showing how dedicated they are to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. It’s their aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.

A Greener Shift is Happening

Even though Polestar have shown that they are embracing the green movement, this is just really reflective of a broader economic shift. If you look at the entertainment sector, for example, you will notice that streaming platforms like Netflix have much lower overheads when compared to traditional cinemas. While data centers powering them do consume energy, studies have shown that the carbon footprint of streaming is substantially lower, showing how entire infrastructures are moving to greener alternatives without compromising service offerings.

In other verticals, like iGaming, online casinos have also shown that there are sustainable alternatives that can be explored. Unlike traditional casinos that require HVAC systems, power, and lighting, online platforms offer thousands of games with a lower carbon footprint. Casino offers and promotions like free spins or deposit matches have also helped to boost player engagement without the cost of large-scale events and travel as well. Not only does this help casinos to access a bigger user demographic, but it also allows them to do so without increasing their carbon footprint. Interestingly, trends like this are converging as well.

Modern electric vehicles are not only becoming greener to make, but they are also integrating streaming services and gaming platforms within their infotainment systems. This shows how green trends can have a knock-on effect on other sectors, and for companies like Polestar, it’s helped them to create greener models that still harness the latest technology. Polestar, in particular for example, offers Android Automotive OS, which includes Prime Video, YouTube, and more through the Vivaldi Web Browser.

Polestar’s Strong Environmental Focus

Since the company began measuring its environmental focus in 2020, they have reduced their carbon footprint per sold car by nearly 25%. Significant contributors here include using low-carbon aluminium in all of their models, as well as making improvements to battery manufacturing. Renewable energy is also being used in the manufacturing process of all models, with increased biofuels on certain ocean routes. Polestar, like other companies that operate in different sectors, have shown that it is possible to detach growth from environmental impact. They also aim to do this in the future. Even though Polestar have the aim of creating a climate-neutral car, they also want to become completely climate-neutral by 2040. They also have the aim of producing a Polestar 2, which is 10 tonnes lower in carbon when compared to when the project as a whole started.

Not only is this helping to set the standard for other electronic car manufacturers, but it also helps to show how much potential there is in the market to offer more, without increasing environmental footprint. As time goes on, we can expect to see the company double down or create even more efficient cars that do not miss out on the latest tech features or advances.",https://evpowered.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Polestar-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:15.017486

Now the story of an unlikely partnership between a utility company and climate activists and how they worked together to help one community switch its heating and cooling to a cleaner source.

Science correspondent Miles O'Brien has the story, part of our Tipping Point coverage on energy and climate.

Miles O’Brien:

Retired schoolteacher Carol Canova has lived in this tiny little house in Framingham, Massachusetts for 30 years. From this humble perch, she has experienced firsthand a historic energy transition. She started with an oil-burning furnace, then switched to gas, and now heats and cools with an electric heat pump attached to a geothermal well.

Carol Canova, Framingham, Massachusetts, Resident:

I was told it would be even heat. I was told it would be efficient and so forth. But seeing is believing. I'd never been in a house that every place in the house was the same temperature.

Miles O’Brien:

Canova is part of a first-in-the-nation pilot by utility giant Eversource. It's a one-mile network of underground pipes connecting three dozen homes and municipal buildings to a shared geothermal well.

It's called networked geothermal, and if it works here, it could be a blueprint for utilities nationwide.

Carol Canova:

So I thought, oh, electricity is expensive. So I'm expecting it's going to be more expensive. What I find out is, it's overall cheaper.

Miles O’Brien:

Heat pumps live up to their name. They move heat. In the summer, they pump heat out of your home. In the winter, they bring it in. How hard they have to work and how much electricity they use depends on the temperature difference between inside and outside. The greater the gap, the more energy they need.

Shallow geothermal wells tap into the earth's steady underground temperature, about 55 degrees year-round. Water with antifreeze circulates through buried pipes, absorbing or releasing heat at that consistent temperature. A heat pump paired with a geothermal well has less work to do and is far more efficient no matter the weather above.

The catch? Drilling a geothermal well is very expensive, but none of the volunteers in this project paid a dime for either the well or the heat pump.

Carol Canova:

When Eversource offered it, I thought, you know what, this is like winning the lottery.

Nikki Bruno, Vice President, Eversource:

Everything else is buried in underground, except for the heat pumps.

Miles O’Brien:

Nikki Bruno is an Eversource V.P.

Nikki Bruno:

So, right outside this building is what we call the main bore field.

Miles O’Brien:

She showed me the pump house, which controls the entire system. It's the only visible sign of the geothermal network.

Nikki Bruno:

Those bores are 600 to 700 pipes that allow the water-based fluid to circulate and exchange energy with the underground.

Miles O’Brien:

Besides many homes like Carol's, heat pumps attached to the geothermal network are in use at a school administration building, a fire station, and a public housing development.

It's an $18.6 million project that comes amid significant changes in regulations. Massachusetts and the other states in the Eversource territory have aggressive climate goals and mandates.

Nikki Bruno:

How do we start offering something different? How can we produce a decarbonized product for our customers, while keeping safe, reliable and I will say as affordable as possible service to customers?

Miles O’Brien:

The idea was born of an unlikely partnership between utility executives and climate activists, among them, Zeybeb Magavi, the executive director of the nonprofit HEET, the Home Energy Efficiency Team. It's a grassroots group that started out by banding together to insulate their homes. They were looking for a way to make a bigger dent.

Zeybeb Magavi, Executive Director, HEET:

We really became aware of kind of a rock-and-a-hard place problem, where we have a gas system that actually we have pipes in the ground from President Lincoln's time.

Miles O’Brien:

Their focus on creaky, leaky gas pipes led them to a moment of insight and inspiration.

Zeybeb Magavi:

The ground, the bedrock, the water all around us is thermal energy, which we can tap. And that's kind of an exciting awakening thing to realize. We could potentially build a utility street by street that was pipes filled with water, maintained and managed by the gas utility, who — becomes a thermal utility.

This infrastructure would be in a way like the roots of our new energy system, right?

Miles O’Brien:

Even federal researchers are bullish. A study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that mass adoption of geothermal heat pumps could reduce the demand for electricity by 13 percent in the next 25 years. But the idea isn't new.

Let's go down in the boiler room. Here we go. You got people down here shoveling coal, right?

Jeff Tester, Engineering Professor, Cornell University:

This is our living laboratory.

Miles O’Brien:

Cornell University engineering professor Jeff Tester built his home in Ithaca, New York, as a living lab of efficiency, solar thermal, photovoltaics, and a heat pump that taps into a geothermal well buried in his backyard.

He's been advocating for ways to tap the heat beneath our feet since the 1970s, when he helped pioneer a novel geothermal energy concept at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Jeff Tester:

One method of extracting heat or mining heat from under the surface of the earth is to create a reservoir.

Miles O’Brien:

He looks back on those days with nostalgia.

Jeff Tester:

They were very supportive of trying new things in those days. We weren't afraid to try something.

Miles O’Brien:

For about 25 years, Cornell has harnessed a natural thermal engine to keep its campus cool. A district-chilling system taps 39-degree water from the depths of Cayuga Lake to cool more than 100 buildings.

Now the university is looking to go deeper and warmer. Jeff Tester is the principal investigator on a groundbreaking project to introduce geothermal heating to the campus. In 2022, his team drilled a nearly two-mile-deep test borehole to assess the available heat resources here.

Jeff Tester:

I feel like I have been training all my life for the day when we actually would see this happen on a campus like Cornell.

Miles O’Brien:

But he's still waiting, looking for money to build a geothermal network of pipes filled with hot water to heat the campus. He says society places great value on fossil fuels and electricity.

Jeff Tester:

But heat is not viewed that way in the same way, and I think we need a fairer system of what I refer to as an equivalent way to actually look at the benefits from clean heating versus clean electricity versus clean fuels. And we're not doing that right now. So we need a new value system for energy.

Miles O’Brien:

The Trump administration apparently does value geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright consistently emphasizes it as a priority, making it the only renewable energy source currently in favor.

Zeybeb Magavi:

It's something we can agree on. It's the ground beneath our feet. Turns out we have common ground.

Miles O’Brien:

And it appears to be growing. Plans are now in place to double the size of the Framingham geothermal network starting next year. Common ground may be hard to find these days, but perhaps it's not far beneath the surface.

The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” \Wiatros-Motyka said. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane.

This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”",https://www.vindy.com/wp-content/themes/coreV3_lazy_vindycustom/images/vindicatorfb.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:03:26.699699

FAQ: NextSource Materials Abu Dhabi Anode Project When is production expected to begin at the Abu Dhabi facility?","Strategic Significance of NextSource Materials' Abu Dhabi Anode Project

The graphite industry is experiencing a transformative shift as NextSource Materials advances its innovative Abu Dhabi anode project. This strategic initiative represents a significant move to establish substantial battery material production capacity outside traditional supply chains, addressing the growing global demand for critical components in electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage systems.

Breaking China's Dominance in the Battery Anode Supply Chain

For decades, China has maintained an overwhelming dominance in the battery anode materials sector, controlling approximately 90% of global natural graphite anode material production capacity according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. This concentration has created vulnerability in global supply chains, particularly as electric vehicle production accelerates worldwide.

The Abu Dhabi facility represents one of the most significant attempts to diversify this critical supply chain. By establishing what NextSource describes as ""one of the leading, if not the biggest, non-Chinese producers of active anode material,"" the project directly addresses concerns about supply security for Western automotive manufacturers and battery producers.

Industry analysts have highlighted that this diversification is arriving at a crucial time. The International Energy Agency's Critical Minerals Market Review notes that only about 5% of anode material production capacity exists outside China, creating a strategic opportunity for well-positioned projects like NextSource's Abu Dhabi facility.

Vertical Integration from Madagascar Graphite to UAE Processing

A distinguishing characteristic of NextSource's strategy is its vertical integration approach. Unlike competitors who often rely on third-party suppliers, NextSource controls its supply chain from mine to finished product through its Molo graphite operation in Madagascar.

The Molo mine, one of the largest and highest-quality graphite resources globally, provides NextSource with secured feedstock supply. According to the company's resource statements, the mine contains measured and indicated resources of 36.6 million tonnes at 7.68% total graphitic carbon.

This integration offers several strategic advantages. Quality control becomes more manageable throughout the supply chain, allowing NextSource to maintain consistent material specifications. The company can also tailor mine output to specific downstream requirements, creating a significant competitive edge in serving demanding customers in premium battery metals investment market segments.

Meeting Critical Demand for EV and Energy Storage Markets

The timing of NextSource's project aligns with explosive growth projections for battery materials. According to Markets and Markets Research, the global anode materials market was valued at approximately $7.9 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $27.3 billion by 2030.

This growth is driven by accelerating electric vehicle adoption and expanding energy storage deployments. Major automotive manufacturers have announced ambitious electrification targets, with many planning to be fully electric within the next decade. Each electric vehicle requires substantial quantities of battery-grade graphite for anode production.

Additionally, grid-scale energy storage installations are growing exponentially as renewable energy penetration increases, creating further demand for high-performance battery materials. NextSource's strategic positioning in this market provides exposure to both these high-growth sectors.

How Will the Abu Dhabi Facility Transform Global Anode Production?

The establishment of NextSource's Abu Dhabi facility represents a significant shift in global anode production dynamics. This project introduces substantial non-Chinese production capacity in a market that has long been dominated by Asian suppliers.

Strategic Location Benefits in UAE's Industrial Ecosystem

The selection of Abu Dhabi as the project location provides NextSource with several distinct advantages. According to the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development, the emirate offers industrial electricity rates approximately 30-40% lower than European averages, significantly reducing operational costs for energy-intensive processing activities.

The regulatory environment also provides benefits, with favorable tax treatment in designated industrial zones. This creates a competitive cost structure compared to alternative locations in Western countries with higher tax burdens and regulatory compliance costs.

Access to Khalifa Port, ranked among the top 50 global container ports, provides efficient logistics connections to both source materials and end markets. This strategic positioning enables NextSource to serve international customers through established shipping lanes with minimized transit times.

The existing industrial infrastructure also accelerates the development timeline.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by two to 547 in the week to October 10.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 39 rigs, or 7% below this time last year.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs fell by four to 418 this week, while gas rigs rose by two to 120, their highest since August.

In the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the biggest U.S. oil-producing shale formation, the rig count fell by one this week to 250, the lowest since September 2021.

In Texas, meanwhile, the rig count dropped by six this week to 238, also the lowest since September 2021.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output. The independent exploration and production, or E&P, companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 4% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.

That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021. Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third straight year in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 56% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

WATCH: Eaton Rapids solar proposal faces local opposition

2,000-acre renewable energy project proposed for Eaton Rapids

The Fiddlehead Solar Project, backed by Chicago-based Hecate Energy, would cover farmland in Hamlin Township, Brookfield Township, and Springport Township Project developer Mark Zwieg said the development promises clean energy, new jobs, tax revenue and economic activity for the area.

""We're committed to do the project the right way, we're committed to work with communities,"" Zwieg said. ""Solar and agriculture can co-exist.""

But neighbors Ali Griffith and Jasmine Emerick, who moved to the area for its agricultural character, are concerned about the project's impact on their community.

""We really wanted to raise our son around agriculture,"" Griffith said.

""So growing up here it was just so peaceful in a place that was different from living in the city."" Emerick said.

The project faces a regulatory hurdle at the local level. Hamlin Township says projects like this on agriculturally zoned land are prohibited under local ordinances. Instead, Hecate Energy plans to use a state process to work around local zoning rules.

""It provides a path to permitting,"" Zwieg said.

Public Act 233, allows companies like Hecate can work through local ordinances through the Michigan Public Service Commission state approval process. The state regulations include requirements such as a 300-foot buffer zone between houses and solar project fencing.

""It's quite upsetting and outrageous and upsetting to us that our zoning rights have been taken away from us,"" Griffith said.

Hecate's next step is submitting their Public Act 233 application, which will trigger another round of community input. Griffith and Emrick said they plan to challenge the project during that process.

""We really want to let the MPSC know our feelings about the project whether it be environmental, property value, disrupting farm land, or wildlife movement patterns,"" Griffith said. ""I think we should hammer that home to our MPSC commissioners.""

Two bills currently waiting in the state Senate - House Bills 4027 and 4028 - would restore local control for large renewable energy projects like the Fiddlehead Solar Project.

Next Steps Achieving permitting reform in this Congress is possible but will require compromise and significant stakeholder pressure.","Permitting reform for energy projects and related infrastructure has been the bipartisan, bicameral white whale of policy for a very long time. Despite broad support for the idea, agreeing on how to actually reform the permitting process has stumped lawmakers. The 119th Congress has continued along this path, with committee leadership from both parties and chambers calling attention to permitting reform and articulating the need for additional actions to speed up timelines and reduce costs for projects. In the span of 10 months, lawmakers have introduced multiple legislative proposals aimed at shortening permitting timelines and reducing the frequency of litigation. Concurrently, the courts and the Trump administration have taken their own actions to redefine the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This alert outlines the current state-of-play in permitting reform efforts across the three branches of the federal government.

First, A Look Back

Permitting reform was on the “to-do” list for Congress when, on Dec. 21, 2024, during the lame duck session of Congress and the Biden administration, Congress passed a stopgap measure to fund the government for three months to avoid a shutdown. Yet, permitting reform provisions did not make it into the legislation passed into law.

For many lawmakers, the failure to reach a compromise deal to accelerate infrastructure development was a missed opportunity—especially as the Democratic Caucus had seemingly grown more receptive to permitting reform after hearing of delays of projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). No one possibly felt this disappointment more than outgoing Sen. Joe Manchin (I-WV), who introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 and spent nearly two years pushing it through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In a pointed statement following the stopgap vote, Sen. Manchin emphasized the continued importance of permitting reform, and suggested these efforts would resume in 2025. “Meaningful permitting reform will continue … next year and cannot be done by executive action alone,” he wrote.

Before the near-finish-line failure of the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, there were two major efforts to update the federal permitting system; the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act in 2015, which created the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council among other things; and, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which extended the FAST Act and introduced statutory deadlines for environmental reviews among other things.

Most recently, on July 4, President Donald Trump signed H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, into law. The bill added Section 112 to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), allowing a project sponsor to pay 125% of the costs associated with developing an environmental review document. If the project sponsor elects to pay this fee, the action agency must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) in one year and an environmental assessment (EA) in 180 days. In an earlier version of the bill, the provision would have exempt the expedited EA and EIS from judicial review. The Senate parliamentarian removed this exemption from the final reconciliation bill after determining it did not comply with the Byrd Rule. In addition, like Sen. Manchin’s Energy Permitting Reform Act, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandates new oil and gas lease sales across federal lands and waters.

Recent Legislative Actions

Various permitting measures have been introduced in this Congress, and more proposals may be forthcoming.

House

The House Energy and Commerce Committee and House Natural Resources Committee have both been actively moving legislation aimed at permitting reform. Below are a few of the major initiatives pending before these committees.

SPEED Act: On July 25, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced H.R.4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. Among its most significant changes, the SPEED Act would codify NEPA as a “purely procedural statute” and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado (Seven County), by requiring federal agencies to only consider effects that are “proximately caused by” the immediate project or action. The bill would add grants to the list of actions that do not automatically trigger National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and prohibit a federal agency from withdrawing any environmental document completed under NEPA unless a court so orders, thereby stopping future administrations from rescinding environmental documents promulgated under prior ones. Regarding judicial review, the SPEED Act would restrict courts from determining a final agency action violates NEPA unless the agency clearly “abused its substantial discretion in complying with” the law and would have reached a different result absent of this abuse of “substantial discretion.”

Further, the bill would prohibit a court from substituting its judgment “for that of the agency regarding the environmental effects of a proposed agency action” and amend the steps courts must take to remand such action. Specifically, the SPEED Act would mandate that a court may only remand a final agency action if it provides specific instruction and a reasonable deadline—no longer than 180 days—to correct deficiencies. Remanded actions may remain in effect during this period.

Additionally, the bill would require parties to file legal challenges within 150 days of the final agency action’s publication and would prohibit parties from contesting the establishment of a categorical exclusion. Lastly, Chairman Westerman’s bill would require parties appealing a court ruling to do so within 60 days, with courts required to rule on appeal within 180 days. On Sept. 10, the House Natural Resources Committee held a legislative hearing to receive testimony on the bill. The committee intends to mark up the bill as soon as this month.

SPEED and Reliability Act: On Sept. 26, Reps. Andy Barr (R-KY) and Scott Peters (D-CA) reintroduced H.R.5600, the Streamlining Powerlines Essential to Electric Demand (SPEED) and Reliability Act. The bill aims to expedite the siting and permitting of electric transmission lines by amending the Federal Power Act, the primary statute governing the wholesale transmission and sale of electric power.

Currently, both the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are required to conduct National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews for the same proposed transmission line under the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) designation process. The SPEED and Reliability Act would remove this duplicative process, requiring that only FERC conduct an environmental review.

Further, the bill would allow FERC to issue a construction permit for individual transmission lines that are designated to be in the national interest, reduce grid congestion and improve reliability without having to undergo NEPA review. The bill was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee for further consideration.

Cheap Energy Act: On Sept. 24, Reps. Sean Casten (D-IL) and Mike Levin (D-CA), cochairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, released draft text for a bill titled the Cheap Energy Act. The lawmakers describe the draft as a “consumer-focused approach” to U.S. energy policy that ensures “cheap, reliable, and clean energy.” It includes language that would repeal the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s provisions eliminating or phasing out energy tax credits, while establishing a new investment tax credit to cover 30% of the cost of new transmission lines, modified existing lines and related property.

The bill would also codify processes for offshore wind leasing and prohibit the Department of the Interior from instating additional levels of review for solar and wind projects. The discussion draft aims to strengthen and build out additional transmission lines as it would authorize more than $2 billion to address the shortage of electricity transformers and complementary grid security technologies, and provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with exclusive siting authority for national interest transmission lines. The bill also intends to expedite the hiring of agency permitting staff and would direct the Council on Environmental Quality to create an online portal for permits that require review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Reps. Levin and Casten hope to introduce formal legislation reflecting this language in early 2026.

House Problem Solvers Caucus Framework: On Sept. 18, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers seeking bipartisan consensus on key political issues, unveiled its new Permitting Reform Framework.

Like the SPEED and Reliability Act, the Cheap Energy Act and the Energy Permitting Reform Act, this framework would expedite the NIETC designation process as it allows for simultaneous state and federal environmental reviews. It would create categorical exclusions for simple updates to existing transmission infrastructure and pipelines, remove the need for a presidential permit when permitting cross-border linear infrastructure, and eliminate the duplicative need for a line-specific National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review pursuant to Section 368 corridors. It would also ensure that judicial standing for litigating projects is limited to parties who submitted detailed comments during public review and establish a one-year statute of limitations for litigation against most projects.

Lastly, it would direct federal agencies to replace their current paper system with a centralized cloud-based platform for all permitting processes. Reps. Gabe Evans (R-CO) and Scott Peters (D-CA), who lead the caucus’ Permitting, Energy and Environment Working Group, along with Cochairs Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY), hope to translate the framework into legislation later this Congress.

ePermit Act: On July 17, Reps. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Dusty Johnson (R-SD) introduced H.R.4503, the ePermit Act, legislation to complement the Trump administration’s efforts to streamline National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. The bill would establish a framework for federal agencies to implement a digital permitting system for energy projects undergoing environmental reviews. It would also create federal data and taxonomy standards, and a governmentwide permitting database to enable better coordination across the federal permitting landscape. Like the SPEED Act, this bill also received testimony during a recent House Natural Resources Committee hearing and awaits further consideration.

Senate

Both Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Mike Lee (R-UT) have recently made statements demonstrating continued interest in working on permitting reform. Most recently, Chairman Lee stated “It’s time for NEPA reform” in a social media post. Below are a few of the pending proposals before their committees.

CLEAR Waters Act: On July 23, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced S.2421, the Clarifying Legal Exclusions Around Regulated (CLEAR) Waters Act. This bill, which is cosponsored by six other Senate Republicans, would amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide exclusions for the term “navigable waters.” This bill attempts to clarify that certain water systems shall not be included under the definition of navigable waters under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, including components of waste treatment systems, groundwater and ephemeral features that flow only in direct response to precipitation. The bill would also allow for additional considerations depending on the determination of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and chief of engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Small Projects Expedited Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act: On May 22, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced S.1894, the Small Projects Expedited Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act. This bill would amend the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) to double the threshold of federal funding under which a project may still qualify for a categorical exclusion due to limited federal involvement. Specifically, the bill would allow projects receiving up to $12 million in federal funds—or have a total estimated cost of up to $70 million—to remain eligible for categorical exclusions. Sen. Lummis’ bill remains in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for further consideration.

Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearing Act: On May 14, Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Chris Coons (D-DE) introduced S.1757, the Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearings Act. This bipartisan bill would amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for more efficient hearings on nuclear facility construction applications. Specifically, the bill would remove the requirement for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to hold a public hearing during the nuclear licensing process if an affected party does not contest the approval. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Interactive Federal Review Act: On April 10, Sens. Lummis and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) introduced S.1430, the Interactive Federal Review Act. This bipartisan bill would improve the environmental review process for highway projects through the use of interactive, digital, cloud-based platforms and digital twins. It would mandate the Department of Transportation (DOT) to select 10 federal-aid highway projects to demonstrate the use of these platforms and models in conducting the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes that NEPA requires. The bill remains in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee where it awaits further review.

Primacy Certainty Act of 2025: On July 29, Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) and Pete Ricketts (R-NE) introduced S.2505, the Primacy Certainty Act of 2025. This bill would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to clarify the timelines and provide certainty and transparency for making a decision on the approval or disapproval of a state underground injection control program. It would mandate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rule on state applications to regulate Class VI injection wells within 180 days. If not, the application automatically takes effect after 210 days if the state already enforces a similar regulatory program. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

MAPWaters Act of 2025: On July 31, Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Angus King (I-VT) introduced S.2637, the Modernizing Access to our Public (MAP) Waters Act of 2025. The bill would provide for the standardization, consolidation and publication of data related to public outdoor recreation use of federal waterways among federal land and water management agencies. Specifically, it would direct the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to adopt interagency standards for data collection and dissemination of geospatial data relating to public outdoor recreational access of federal waterways and federal fishing restrictions. The bill was referred to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act: On July 23, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Andy Kim (D-NJ) introduced S.2390, the Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act. This bill would reclassify certain activities by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as it relates to housing as necessary administrative actions to allow for certain activities to be streamlined. It would also call for additional categorical exclusions if a proposed housing-related activity does not materially alter environmental conditions and does not materially exceed the original scope of the project. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Necessary Environmental Exemptions for Defense Act: On July 9, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced S.2226, the Necessary Environmental Exemptions for Defense Act. This bill would allow for certain activities from the Defense Department to be exempt from requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, if the secretary of defense certifies they are directly related to countering the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Court Actions

These legislative efforts come as court rulings have reshaped the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) authorities. The section below provides an overview of the relevant court actions changing or shaping the permitting review process.

As summarized in our July 18, 2025, Client Alert, on Nov. 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) in Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration, held that CEQ lacks the authority to issue binding regulations governing federal agencies’ implementation of NEPA. Specifically, the D.C. Circuit found that there is no statutory language suggesting that Congress empowered CEQ to issue binding rules and act as a regulatory agency. It contended that CEQ’s legal authority is, for all practical purposes, identical to the duties Congress assigned to the Council of Economic Advisors, another consultative agency within the Executive Office of the President. Historically, CEQ stated its rulemaking authority originated not from legislation, but from Executive Order 11991, issued by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Executive Order 11991 replaced more than 70 different sets of agency regulations across the executive branch and helped create CEQ’s framework, recognizing its authority to advise the president on environmental issues and NEPA implementation. To this, the D.C. Circuit held that executive orders cannot give an agency rulemaking authority, only statutes can.

Months later, on May 29, the Supreme Court, in Seven County, unanimously held that NEPA reviews do not require federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts beyond the immediate effects of the action over which the agency has regulatory authority. This case concerned the U.S. Surface Transportation Board’s (STB) decision to approve an application to construct an 88-mile railroad line after performing a NEPA review. The D.C. Circuit held that STB violated NEPA by failing to sufficiently consider the reasonably foreseeable effects increased upstream crude oil production and downstream refining operations could have on the environment, given the railway would facilitate this activity. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit in a strongly worded opinion emphasizing that agencies, when conducting NEPA review, are not considering other “future or geographically separate projects that may be built as a result.”

Agency Actions

Concurrently, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions to facilitate permitting reform. The section below provides an overview of the recent executive actions on permitting reform.

Following the ruling in Marin Audubon Society, which held that CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations were ultra vires, President Donald Trump’s Day One Executive Order 14154 directed CEQ to eliminate its NEPA regulations. The order also revoked President Jimmy Carter’s Executive Order 11991. On Feb. 25, CEQ issued an Interim Final Rule rescinding its NEPA regulations. The final rule went into effect on April 11.

Consistent with Executive Order 14154, federal agencies must revise or establish NEPA implementing procedures that expedite permitting approvals. Executive Order 14154 also directed CEQ to provide guidance on implementing NEPA to expedite these processes. On Feb. 19, CEQ issued interim guidance calling on agencies to revise their NEPA procedures to align with Executive Order 14154 and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).

As explained in our June 2, 2024, client alert, the FRA made the following changes to NEPA:

Included new definitions for “major federal action”; 2) Limited NEPA analysis to the “reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of the proposed agency action”; 3) Allowed agencies to rely on a final programmatic environmental document for five years without additional review so long as there are no new circumstances or information that impact the analysis; 4) Set into statute a 75-page limit for EAs and 150-page limit for most EISs. However, the FRA allows EISs to reach 300 pages if the project is extraordinarily complex; 5) Required agencies to complete EAs within one year and EISs within two years; and 6) Permitted agencies to adopt categorical exclusions listed in another agency’s NEPA procedures after meeting certain conditions.

On Sept. 29, CEQ updated its guidance to federal agencies concerning their implementation of NEPA. The new guidance asks that agencies continue to update NEPA implementing procedures to reflect Executive Order 14154 and the FRA, as well as the statutory changes that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act made and the Supreme Court’s opinion in Seven County, both of which came after CEQ issued its initial guidance.

In this updated guidance, CEQ is also providing agencies with an agency procedures template to assist them in preparing or revising their NEPA procedures. CEQ says the template is not mandatory or binding but is instead meant to provide clarity and technical assistance to agencies as they develop or update their respective guidelines. The template is organized as a Federal Register notice and offers agencies the ability to promulgate their NEPA implementing procedures for publication in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In July, departments of Energy, Agriculture, Interior, Defense and Transportation, among others, issued updated procedures to reflect recent changes to NEPA outside of the CFR in the form of guidance or a handbook. According to CEQ’s new guidance, while agencies are free to choose their own unique approaches when they are promulgating their updated NEPA procedures, they must still consult with CEQ and submit to them required documentation for review.

Next Steps

Achieving permitting reform in this Congress is possible but will require compromise and significant stakeholder pressure. The bills outlined above are an indication that lawmakers are interested in working across the aisle on reforming the permitting process for energy and related infrastructure projects. Additionally, several large trade organizations have already called upon congressional leadership to pass permitting reform, including the Edison Electric Institute, the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce. The pathways to moving any or all of these ideas are not limited to energy projects as Congress may look to reforming the process for permitting broader projects, including roads and bridges through the required reauthorization of the Surface Transportation bill currently moving through the legislative process.

The most significant changes are likely to come from regulatory agencies, at least in the short term. It remains uncertain exactly how much permitting timelines will accelerate under the new procedures already put in place by the Trump administration, but it is generally expected that these changes will significantly expedite the process. More executive actions like the one that established the National Energy Dominance Council aimed at coordinating agency action on permitting can be expected.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14565_3925.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:40.149688

The violations, primarily at TBC’s Bastrop and Austin sites, involve improper wastewater discharge, air pollution, and construction non-compliance, leading to $2.2 million in proposed fines from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and other agencies. This controversy adds to Musk’s regulatory challenges amid his high-profile ventures. In this article, we examine the violations, regulatory actions, and their impact on TBC’s operations and Musk’s broader enterprises. The Wall Street Journal

Details of the 800+ Environmental Violations

The violations span multiple environmental regulations at TBC’s Texas sites, particularly its 1,500-acre Bastrop campus and Austin-area tunneling projects:

Violation Count: Over 800 infractions since 2021, with 400+ related to wastewater discharges and 200+ tied to air quality breaches.

Wastewater Issues: TBC allegedly discharged untreated wastewater into local waterways, violating Clean Water Act permits. This includes 150+ instances of releasing industrial runoff without proper treatment.

Air Pollution: Over 200 violations involve unpermitted emissions from construction and boring equipment, exceeding volatile organic compound (VOC) limits.

Construction Non-Compliance: 100+ cases of unauthorized land disturbance and failure to implement stormwater controls at Bastrop.

Fines Proposed: TCEQ and local authorities have issued $2.2 million in penalties, with $1.5 million for wastewater and $700,000 for air quality violations.

TBC’s Bastrop site, home to tunnel testing and manufacturing, has drawn scrutiny for its proximity to the Colorado River, amplifying environmental concerns.

Reasons Behind the Violations

Several factors contributed to TBC’s regulatory lapses:

Rapid Expansion: TBC’s aggressive push to scale tunneling projects, including a proposed Austin hyperloop, outpaced environmental compliance efforts.

Regulatory Oversight Gaps: Texas’s business-friendly environment initially allowed lax monitoring, but increased scrutiny followed community complaints.

Operational Oversights: Inadequate wastewater treatment systems and failure to secure air permits reflect internal mismanagement.

Musk’s Approach: Critics argue Musk’s focus on speed and innovation, seen in ventures like SpaceX, prioritizes progress over regulatory adherence.

Regulatory and Community Response

The TCEQ and local authorities have intensified enforcement:

Fines and Orders: TBC faces $2.2 million in fines, with mandates to install wastewater treatment systems and obtain air permits by Q1 2026.

Community Pushback: Bastrop residents and environmental groups have raised alarms over water contamination risks, prompting public hearings.

TBC’s Response: The company has pledged to address violations, investing $10 million in compliance upgrades, but disputes some penalty amounts.

Federal Oversight: The EPA is reviewing TBC’s Clean Water Act breaches, potentially escalating penalties.

Implications for The Boring Company and Musk’s Ventures

The violations pose significant challenges:

Operational Delays: Compliance costs and regulatory delays could slow TBC’s Austin and Bastrop projects, impacting timelines for tunneling contracts.

Reputation Risk: The controversy tarnishes Musk’s image, already strained by debates like his H-1B visa defense, potentially affecting investor confidence.

Financial Strain: $2.2 million in fines and $10 million in upgrades add pressure to TBC, which has raised $800 million but remains unprofitable.

Industry Scrutiny: Increased focus on Musk’s ventures, like SpaceX’s regulatory battles, could tighten oversight across his portfolio.

The Bigger Picture: Musk’s Regulatory Challenges

TBC’s 800 violations reflect broader tensions between Musk’s innovation-driven ventures and regulatory frameworks, paralleling issues like xAI’s $10B raise amid AI ethics debates or SpaceFields’ ₹42 crore funding for defense tech. In India, where environmental compliance is critical (e.g., Bira 91’s crisis), TBC’s case underscores the need for sustainable practices in high-growth sectors.

What’s Next for The Boring Company?

Key developments to watch:

TCEQ’s final penalty ruling and TBC’s compliance progress by Q1 2026.

Potential EPA sanctions escalating federal oversight.

Community lawsuits or settlements impacting Bastrop operations.

TBC’s ability to secure new contracts amid reputational damage.

Conclusion

The Boring Company’s 800+ environmental violations in Texas, with $2.2 million in fines, highlight the challenges of balancing rapid innovation with regulatory compliance. As TBC addresses wastewater and air quality issues, its response will shape its future and Musk’s broader ventures. The controversy underscores the importance of environmental stewardship in transformative industries.",https://lapaasvoice.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Elon-Org_boring-1024x683.webp,N,,2025-10-11 13:03:49.154854

Utility-scale solar applications have popped up throughout the state as developers sought to tie in to the massive transmission line and its substations.
Another blow to utility-scale solar in Nevada The cancellation is the latest in a series of blows to the buildout of utility-scale solar in Nevada.
Now, utility-scale projects must be under construction within the next year and completed by the end of 2027 to receive the credits.","A massive solar project proposed to be built in rural Esmeralda County with a footprint roughly the size of Las Vegas appears to have been scrapped by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Applicants were seeking to construct seven geographically contiguous utility-scale solar projects known as the Esmeralda 7, west of Tonopah and north of Dyer. The projects would have covered roughly 62,000 acres, but to accommodate rights-of-way and other necessary land, roughly 119,000 acres (185 square miles) were earmarked for the project.

First reported by Heatmap, the BLM’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Register on Friday listed the environmental review status for the Esmeralda 7 project as “cancelled.” The law requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions.

“The BLM wouldn’t cancel it unless the proponents wanted it cancelled,” said Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, an environmental nonprofit that has opposed the project. “I just can’t think of any other reason why it would be cancelled.”

Combined, Esmeralda 7’s individual projects would have easily become Nevada’s largest solar project to date with a 6,200-megawatt nameplate capacity — the maximum amount of power they could have produced under ideal conditions — which would be enough to power millions of homes. Actual output was expected to be less.

In 2023, the bureau started the process of reviewing applications for the seven solar projects. It immediately garnered pushback from conservationists and many of Esmeralda County’s roughly 720 residents who opposed the scope of the project.

“If this is built, it’s gonna be really noticeable,” Nancy Boland, a former Esmeralda County commissioner, previously told The Nevada Independent. “Your whole sense of freedom is going to be affected.”

In a follow-up call Friday, Boland said she’s “very happy” about the news, saying Esmeralda 7 would have had outsized effects on the region’s desert bighorn sheep population.

“We were really opposed to it,” she said. “With all of these things, they should slow down. We aren’t the only ones having problems with these vast decisions with these solar things.”

The sprawling Esmeralda 7 was going to be located along NV Energy’s Greenlink project, a pair of large-scale transmission corridors set to span from Las Vegas to Reno and then east to Ely. Utility-scale solar applications have popped up throughout the state as developers sought to tie in to the massive transmission line and its substations. The Greenlink project is also facing delays, as well as ongoing rising costs.

The final environmental impact statement for Esmeralda 7 — the last step before a record of decision is issued — was set to be released at the end of April but was delayed under the Trump administration.

“While we await further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process, we remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email. “We need more power on the grid, fast, and the solar and storage industry is ready to provide it, but we need the administration to get serious about truly achieving American energy dominance.""

The federal government remains shut down, and multiple spokespeople for the BLM did not return Friday phone calls to The Nevada Independent.

Another blow to utility-scale solar in Nevada

The cancellation is the latest in a series of blows to the buildout of utility-scale solar in Nevada.

Under President Donald Trump’s controversial budget enacted earlier this year, utility-scale solar tax credits previously set to expire at the end of 2032 are being rolled back much sooner. Now, utility-scale projects must be under construction within the next year and completed by the end of 2027 to receive the credits.

“I believe a lot of these projects are politically not favored by Trump,” said Kevin Emmerich, co-founder of Basin and Range Watch, a conservation focused nonprofit that also opposed the Esmeralda 7 project.

The Department of the Interior, which oversees the BLM, now must specifically approve any decision relating to utility-scale solar projects, adding another layer of red tape for advancing projects.

“It doesn’t make sense monetarily for them to do this right now, with everything going on with Trump, with the lack of subsidies and the push for other types of power,” Netherton said.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2024/08/1682bdf6-esmeralda-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:58:17.811714

With over 150 hydroelectric projects producing affordable, reliable, and clean energy, at times we are left with excess hydropower that can be readily available to supply hydrogen projects, which in turn, can fuel heavy transportation and manufacturing projects.

In April of this year, I wrote about the importance of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and how it will help boost energy and economic development in our region. Now, due to the shutdown of the federal government caused by Senate Democrats refusing to pass a clean a continuing resolution, funding for the Hub has been eliminated. On October 2, the Department of Energy (DOE) cancelled a grant award totaling $1 billion, effectively halting the project indefinitely. Following the announcement, I reached out to DOE Secretary Chris Wright asking this decision to be reversed. I remain fully committed to the success of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and the hundreds of jobs it will bring to Central Washington.

Apart from the dramatic increase in energy production, the Hub would bring thousands of new jobs in engineering, construction, and manufacturing that will boost economic development and investments in local communities in the PNW. Washington’s ports, both coastal and inland, would become global centers for hydrogen exports and supply international markets with clean American fuel.

Make no mistake, the elimination of funding for the Hub is a direct consequence of the federal government shutdown. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has broader funding authority during a shutdown, and because Senate Democrats – including Washington’s Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell – did not support the House’s clean continuing resolution, the Hub’s funding was cut.

To support the Hub and all it will do for our region, I sent a letter to Secretary Wright requesting the reinstatement of funding for the Clean Hydrogen Hub Program and to work with Congress to ensure the program is managed responsibly for the sake of American energy security.

The decision marks a sharp retreat from strategies intended to buffer EV demand after the subsidy’s formal expiration on Sept. 30.

In late September, Ford and GM had quietly rolled out programs to preserve the lease-embedded credit benefit. Their financial arms would make down payments on EVs in dealer inventory before the Sept. 30 cutoff, allowing those vehicles to qualify for the $7,500 credit. Dealers would then lease those same cars to customers with the credit “baked in” to the payments.

Behind the scenes, the automakers coordinated with IRS officials to ensure the structure met eligibility rules—i.e., demonstrating acquisition by the deadline via a binding contract and payment. GM at one point planned to apply this to about 20,000 vehicles.

GM pulled back first on Oct. 8, stating it would not claim the credit and instead would fund lease incentives internally through October. A day later, Ford confirmed it would not pursue the scheme either, though it pledged to continue competitive lease pricing via Ford Credit and existing incentives.

This retrenchment follows criticism of the workarounds from lawmakers, notably Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former dealer, who called them a circumvention of policy.

Impact on EV Supply, Demand & Sales Mix

The federal subsidy for new EVs had been a linchpin of U.S. EV demand. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expanded it and allowed consumers to transfer it to dealers at point of sale.

Its expiration is expected to erode demand sharply. Some forecasts project EV registrations could fall 20–30% without the subsidy.

Already in 2025, automakers were pushing pre-buy demand before the cutoff. Ford, for example, extended a free home charger offer to stimulate sales earlier in the year.

Beyond sales declines, GM has taken steps to scale back EV production in anticipation of reduced demand. The company plans to pause or slow output at plants producing models like the Cadillac LYRIQ and Chevy Bolt, and to delay starting a second shift on other lines.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2025/F-150_Lightning_Flash_1_full.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:01:33.892751

While many federal tax credits for home upgrades are set to expire at the end of 2025, several major state rebates created by the Inflation Reduction Act are still in effect — and for many households, these incentives can cover nearly the entire cost of improvements.

Existing state-level rebates are designed to help Americans save money on projects such as insulation, air sealing, and replacing outdated appliances like gas stoves with induction models.

Incentives like these don't just reduce monthly utility bills; they also encourage the widespread adoption of clean energy and green technology, which helps cool the planet. Many households qualify for coverage of up to 100% of project costs, making these upgrades even more affordable for low- and moderate-income families.

In the Southeast, rebate programs are already up and running in Georgia and North Carolina, with Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee preparing to launch similar energy programs imminently, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

Georgia's program, for example, offers households thousands of dollars in potential savings, while North Carolina's Energy Saver initiative has already begun helping disadvantaged communities lower their energy burden.

Moreover, some programs offer retroactive coverage for projects initiated after August 2022, meaning residents may be eligible to claim savings on upgrades they've already made.

One of the most attractive opportunities to upgrade and save is in the kitchen.

Gas stoves have been linked to harmful indoor air pollution, whereas induction stoves are a safer, faster, and more cost-effective alternative. Thanks to federal incentives, Americans can still claim up to $840 off the cost of an induction range.

Renters or homeowners who are not ready to replace their stoves can start with smaller options, such as plug-in induction burners, which cost as little as $50.

Ultimately, while some federal tax credits are set to expire, appliance rebates will continue through 2031 or until funds are exhausted.

Acting sooner rather than later could translate to thousands of dollars in savings — and a more comfortable, efficient, climate-friendly home.

Whether it's an induction stove or a simple plug-in burner, small changes in the kitchen can make a big difference for your health, your wallet, and the planet.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kitchen-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:01:39.396824

The landmark agreement underscores Avaada’s commitment to driving India’s clean energy transition and supporting Gujarat’s vision of becoming a leading renewable energy hub.

Massive Renewable Energy Push Across Gujarat

Under the MoU, Avaada will develop a diverse renewable energy portfolio, including:

5 GW of solar power capacity,

1 GW of wind energy projects, and

5 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS).

The projects will be spread across Kutch, Banaskantha, and Surendranagar districts—regions well-suited for renewable energy generation due to their vast land availability and favorable climatic conditions. Planned for commissioning between 2027 and 2030, these initiatives will significantly contribute to Gujarat’s sustainable growth, energy independence, and long-term carbon reduction goals.

Strengthening Gujarat’s Green Energy Footprint

Avaada already has a strong presence in Gujarat’s renewable energy landscape. The company is currently operating a 280 MW solar power project in Surendranagar and a 100 MW solar plant in Vadodara. With the new investments, Avaada aims to expand its footprint while reinforcing its role as a key partner in India’s renewable energy mission. The integration of battery energy storage systems will enhance grid stability. It will also improve the management of intermittent renewable generation, ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply.

Driving Jobs, Growth, and Sustainability

Beyond clean energy generation, Avaada’s projects will bring significant socio-economic benefits to Gujarat. The renewable energy expansion is expected to create over 1,000 direct and 2,000 indirect jobs, alongside 5,000 employment opportunities during the construction phase. The large-scale investment supports the state’s push for green industrial development. It also aims to attract private capital and promote sustainable livelihoods.

Reinforcing India’s Clean Energy Goals

The partnership between Avaada and the Gujarat government reflects India’s push toward renewable energy. It aligns with the National Green Hydrogen Mission and the 2070 net-zero target. By integrating solar, wind, and storage, Avaada’s initiative exemplifies the next generation of hybrid renewable projects capable of delivering both energy security and environmental resilience.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis.
Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases.
They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.
Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors.","GUQUAN, China — In China, the longest ultrahigh-voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City.

The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers.

That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines emit static electricity that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole.

“As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a 6-inch fish he had just caught.

China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about.

But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions, far from most of its people and factories. More than 90% of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid.

Beijing’s central planners, having underestimated the country’s swift adoption of solar and wind energy, are building the world’s first nationwide grid of ultrahigh-voltage power transmission lines.

Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Donald Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy.

In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers.

Even before Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles.

Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries.

China’s more efficient power lines have broad consequences for the global race against climate change. They will help determine how quickly China can reduce its world-leading use of coal, a stain on the country’s clean energy track record. China uses as much coal as the entire rest of the world, and emits more greenhouse gases than the United States and the European Union combined.

The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use.

Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule.

The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared.

“State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai.

In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated.

“To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year.

China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes.

The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than 7 million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households.

To put the scale of China’s power grid build-out in perspective, consider that the United States has a handful of 765-kilovolt lines and a few running at 500 kilovolts or less, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research group. The 765-kilovolt lines together total about 2,000 miles — the length of a single line across China.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time.

In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas.

Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41% since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away.

China’s ultrahigh-voltage network has helped the country limit its dependence on imported oil and natural gas, but it has also created new vulnerabilities. Much of northwestern China, where many of the lines are being built, is mountainous. As a result, lines had to be closely bunched as they hug a single, flood-prone tributary of the Yellow River that passes between earthquake-prone mountain ranges from Dunhuang to Lanzhou in Gansu province.

For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.

China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information, and intolerance for public dissent.

Some villagers in Anhui province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction.

The line carries mostly solar and wind energy, as well as some coal-fired power, from the Gurbantünggüt Desert in Xinjiang. It helps supply electricity to big eastern Chinese cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing.

Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, expressed concern.

“When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.”

The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by.

Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.”

Starting in November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, the stock market took off and now sits at record highs, following three years of double-digit gains. Solomon warned that some of the current AI frenzy was similar to the dot-com mania of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Most investors recall the incredible sell-off that followed almost five years of seemingly endless new highs for the stock market, before the bubble burst on March 10, 2000, and bottomed out in October of 2002. The Goldman Sachs leader warns that a “drawdown” (another term for a sell-off) could occur in the next 12 to 24 months. With a vast window like that, there is an excellent chance he will be proven right.

Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is the world’s second-largest investment bank by revenue and is ranked 55th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. The Wall Street white-glove giant offers financing, advisory services, risk distribution, and hedging for the firm’s institutional and corporate clients. We review the firm’s Conviction List of top stock ideas every month, seeking companies that offer the highest dividends and have the safest investment profile. Four current picks are ideal for investors concerned about the potential for a “drawdown” over the next one to two years, which seems likely given the current lofty levels at which the stock market is trading.

Why we recommend Goldman Sachs stocks

Goldman Sachs is the acknowledged leader in the investment landscape on Wall Street and worldwide. The firm’s top-notch research department continues to provide institutional and high-net-worth clients with the best ideas across the investment spectrum. It is likely to continue doing so for years. While the firm states it is not yet time to worry about a tech bubble, it is likely high time to prepare for one. They said this recently:

There are elements of investor behavior and market pricing currently that resemble previous bubbles, including the rise in absolute valuations, high market concentration, increased capital intensity among leading companies, and the emergence of vendor financing. However, we see key differences: First, the appreciation of the technology sector has been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation about future growth. Second, the leading companies that have seen the strongest returns have robust balance sheets. Third, the AI space has, so far, been dominated by a few incumbents; most bubbles form during a period of intense competition as both investors and new entrants flood into the space.

Ken Paxton walked onto the stage with a pyrotechnic introduction.

Hundreds of young faces at the Texas Youth Summit, held outside of Houston last month, stared at Paxton as he boasted about the more than 120 combined lawsuits he filed against former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He recounted the obstacles he has overcome since becoming Texas attorney general a decade ago, including a historic impeachment that concluded with his acquittal. The crowd cheered.

He then made his pitch to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who Paxton said has been in office since the 62-year-old was in college.

“I just decided, you know what? It's time that we have representation in Washington that will fight for us,” Paxton said to a roar of approval. “We deserve somebody that will fight for our constitutional rights.”

Paxton’s speech was among a series of recent stops the attorney general has made in front of young Republicans, a group that’s riding a surge in political momentum in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Paxton and other Republican candidates vying for one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats are trying to tap into that energy to gain an edge in the wide-open contest, betting that Kirk's killing will galvanize turnout among a voting bloc that usually stays home during primaries.

In the last few weeks, Paxton said he would “look into” Texas Christian University for allegedly canceling an event with an anti-trans influencer, even though the school has said the event was never booked in the first place. This week, he spoke at a packed rally held by the Texas Tech University chapter of Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded when he was 18

He’s also the only Texan scheduled to speak at America Fest, Turning Point’s annual marquee event in December. He will share the stage with other grassroots GOP powerhouses like Donald Trump Jr., Steve Bannon and Kirk’s widow, Ericka.

Paxton “is special like President Trump in that he is the exception and not the rule,” said Christian Collins, a former congressional candidate and aide who founded the Texas Youth Summit in 2019.

Collins described Paxton as an accessible elected official who gave Collins his cellphone number the first time they met, and whom Collins often greets at events all over the state, where Paxton often speaks with activists and parents. “Ken Paxton is just a darling of the MAGA movement,” Collins said.

Still, Paxton is campaigning with a lot of baggage in tow. Despite emerging victorious in the political and legal battles he often brings up in front of audiences, some Republican strategists believe he could cost the party the Senate seat in a general election against a Democrat.

The accusations Paxton has weathered include committing securities fraud, abusing his office and having an extramarital affair.

The primary race also grew more crowded this week when U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, announced his bid for Cornyn’s seat. Hunt is a former Army combat veteran, a rising Republican star and an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump. He is also courting young voters: He was among the speakers at the Texas Youth Summit, and his campaign pointed to events where he has spoken at schools in his district.

“Young people are the future of this country, and as the youngest candidate in the race for U.S. Senate in Texas, I will bring a fresh perspective to the Senate,” Hunt, 43, said in a statement.

Cornyn’s campaign noted the senator headlined the Texas Young Republicans Federation convention the same weekend that Paxton and Hunt spoke at the conference in The Woodlands.

“Sen. Cornyn spends considerable time with young conservative professionals around Texas,” campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak said. “We will actively compete to win the votes of as many young Texas GOP primary voters as possible in this race.”

It remains to be seen whether the energy radiating through young conservatives in Texas and beyond will continue into the March primary and election day next year.

Texas’ young voters have historically made up a sliver of overall turnout in elections, including primaries, which are arguably the most important elections in Texas. While some years have seen voters under 30 sign up to vote in droves, they don’t always make it to the polls.

But Paxton and the other candidates may have good reason to believe that could change following Kirk’s killing on a Utah campus in early September.

Texas already has hundreds of Turning Point USA chapters, which help spur conservative activism, register voters and host events with GOP influencers and elected officials who fire up students and encourage them to continue their organizing.

The organization has received more than 120,000 inquiries since Kirk’s death to start new chapters across the nation, with a spokesperson recently saying, ""We are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and college campus in America.""

“There is no question that Charlie Kirk's assassination tragically, yet poignantly, has been a turning point for America and especially for conservatives,” Mackowiak said.

The United States has announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, which will raise the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports to approximately 130%.

The announcement, made by President Donald Trump on October 10, through a Truth Social post, marks the sharpest escalation in US-China trade tensions since the original tariff war began in 2018.

GTRI stated ""The impact will be felt quickly. Prices of EVs, wind turbines, and semiconductor parts are expected to rise, while the U.S. will try to ""friend-shore"" its mineral supply chains to Australia, Vietnam, and Canada. China, meanwhile, is likely to redirect supplies toward its non-Western partners to strengthen alternative industrial networks"".

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, effective November 1, 2025. This is in addition to existing tariffs and comes in response to new export controls on rare earth minerals imposed by China, indispensable for US defence, electric vehicles, and clean-energy industries.

The GTRI report also noted that, given the strategic importance of rare earths to US industries, Washington may soon have little choice but to reach a new deal with Beijing. Unlike the US, which often acts before weighing economic consequences, China appears more deliberate and better prepared.

The report highlighted that America still depends heavily on China for electronics, textiles, footwear, white goods, and solar panels, leaving it exposed to retaliation.

As prices surge once the new tariffs take effect, President Trump could struggle to contain inflation and production costs. His tough-on-China strategy risks backfiring--hurting US consumers and undermining his broader economic agenda.

It stated, ""As prices surge once the new tariffs take effect, President Trump could struggle to contain inflation and production costs.""

For India, the report stated that no deal with the US is ever final.

ADVERTISEMENT

The much-publicised US-China ""Phase One"" trade deal of 2025, which capped US tariffs at 30 per cent and China's at 10 per cent, has already been overtaken by the new 100 per cent duty order.

GTRI suggested that India must negotiate carefully and on equal terms, ensuring reciprocity and preserving strategic autonomy.

ADVERTISEMENT

It added that rather than relying on shifting U.S. promises, New Delhi should focus on building self-reliance in critical technologies and minerals.

GTRI noted that this will help insulate the economy from future trade shocks while allowing India to leverage its neutral position to strengthen ties with both Western and BRICS economies.

The evidence is there–melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather. Climate change is accelerating, but instead of taking action, we have attached party identities to the issues and are now facing the consequences of political polarization.

Party issues create swings between administrations–these frequent reversals are what make our system of government unique. But unlike some domestic policies where this “swing” can be healthy, we cannot treat climate action as a partisan issue when there are global consequences.

I graduated from high school this spring, and while I just began studying political science, I am no expert yet. Already in my lifetime, I have noticed environmental changes in Iowa: frequent flooding, record temperatures, and extreme storms. That’s why I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), a volunteer organization seeking bipartisan climate solutions through grassroots advocacy.

CCL’s neutral approach bridges many perceptions and concerns about climate policies, and one opportunity to exercise this is through lobbying. Thanks to fundraising led by Northeast Iowa’s CCL Chapter Leader Leslie Sand and a generous grant from the Northeast Iowa Peace and Justice Center, I have had the opportunity twice now to lobby Iowa’s members of Congress for bipartisan climate action.

During meetings with Reps. Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra and Sen. Chuck Grassley, our focus was on the role of clean energy and the global “clean energy race.” But policy compromise still felt out of reach because of a major national barrier: political parties.

Political polarization has national leaders trapped in rigid agendas. One reason for this could be because political identities have become a defining factor in political decisions and voting patterns through political polarization, both at an individual and party level, which encourage party-line votes. But another reason could be political pressure from party leaders or administrations to vote and act certain ways. This is a big problem, especially for climate policies.

Climate policies are urgent, but as work continues to find bipartisan solutions, our leaders seem to be drifting farther apart. Climate change does not care how you vote. It is our responsibility to remind our leaders to work together and prioritize bipartisan climate action.

Despite divisiveness within our current political environment, I remain optimistic. My conversations locally and in D.C. have changed how I approach climate change, and I believe that by working together, we can protect our future.

It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov.
The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects.
Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan.
“ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”","Louisiana officials have canceled another major coastal restoration project — the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish.

Gordon Dove, chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, confirmed to WVUE-TV Fox 8 Wednesday that the state will not continue the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion. The project would have channeled fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River near Wills Point to the dying coastal marshes of Breton Sound.

It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov. Jeff Landry has shut down. He scrapped the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project in May even though $3 billion from the Deepwater Horizon settlement was available to complete the project and $560 million had already been spent. Construction hadn’t yet begun on the Mid-Breton project.

Both projects served as key initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, which has been in place for nearly two decades. Although the state is currently operating other river diversions, they are smaller in scope and designed only to prevent saltwater intrusion — not restore land.

Landry’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. He previously criticized the Mid-Barataria project for its rising costs and potential harm to oyster fisheries in that area.

Dove told WVUE the cost of Mid-Breton had ballooned from several hundred million dollars to an estimated $1.8 billion. The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects. The money came from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement.

Coastal marshland serves as a natural storm barrier against hurricanes and soaks up rain and flood waters. It also creates habitat for fish and wildlife and absorbs air pollution.

Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan. Scientists say the marsh is dying because it stopped receiving the nutrient-rich fresh water and sediment once levees were built to control flooding along the Mississippi River. Rising sea levels brought about by climate change have made the situation worse, the plan stated.

Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, criticized the state’s decision in a news release Thursday, saying it goes against accepted science and the interests of Louisiana residents.

Cancelling the project could also place other coastal restoration efforts in jeopardy. Restore spokesman Charles Sutcliffe pointed out that other initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, such as marsh building projects, rely on the sediment diversions for their long-term sustainability.

Dredging and marsh creation projects left in the plan are going to sink and erode without a consistent source of fresh water and sediment, Sutcliffe added. He questioned the point of having a Coastal Master Plan that many stakeholders agreed on if one person can decide “behind closed doors” to cancel its biggest projects at any time.

The state’s Coastal Master Plan represents years of bipartisan work and investments from government officials, scientists, business owners, residents and engineers. The Mid-Breton project was added to the plan in 2007.

“This cancellation disregards the decades of transparency and significant effort that went into research, permitting, community engagement and modeling for the project,” Restore said in a news release. “ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/10/6.-Mid-Breton-WVUE.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 09:59:24.651717

The Senate recessed last night and is scheduled to return on Tuesday, October 14, making it unlikely that military service members will receive a paycheck on October 15. Republican leadership continues to say they will not bring a standalone bill on military pay to the floor; however, Rep. Jen Kiggans’ (R-VA) bill to ensure military pay (H.R. 5401) has 148 co-sponsors (104 Republicans, 44 Democrats). Notably, Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA) signed onto the bill. The White House has reportedly considered using tariff revenue to cover the next military paychecks. The two current inflection points are military pay and the fact that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is unlikely to acquiesce, given the “No Kings” events scheduled for October 18.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is no longer allowing Minority Leader Schumer to file cloture on the Democrat CR (S.2882), meaning it will no longer be regularly voted on. This leaves the Republican House-backed CR (H.R. 5371) as the only option forward. The Democrats have one more reconsideration left for their CR, which they may bring forward at any time.

Today, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) announced there will be more rescissions coming. Rescissions are the formal process of rolling back funding that Congress has already appropriated. There have been two rescissions so far this term, at the request of the White House. The first was a Congressionally approved rescission of $9 billion in funding, and the second was a “pocket rescission” of $4 billion, the nature of which allowed for the side-stepping of Congressional approval. The introduction of another rescission could push lawmakers even further away from an agreement on reopening the government.

Reductions in Force

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on social media that reductions-in-force (RIFs) have begun. In response, Leader Thune said, “I think they held off as long as they could.” As promised, the layoffs are coming from not-yet-specified “Democrat programs” across nine agencies, including the Department of the Interior, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of the Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It appears that it is primarily currently furloughed employees who are receiving RIFs.

Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) has spoken out against Director Vought’s mass layoffs, saying she “strongly opposes [the] attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.” Many details are still unfolding. Here is what has surfaced so far:

HHS employees received a memo stating that the RIFs are “a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown.”

The only specified number of layoffs at this time is 1,300 workers from the Department of the Treasury.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been specifically identified for layoffs within DHS, but it is unclear if that is the only program within the agency that will face personnel cuts.

The world is aiming to develop a more cooperative narrative in the energy sector as it deals with the substantial shift in the energy sector.

Gulf energy heavyweights are raking in billions by fostering international investment in their energy industries

The Gulf region has long been the envy of other high-energy usage countries around the world. They have vast amounts of natural resources that have enabled the countries in the region to become heavyweights in the boxing ring of the global economy.

The economic boom that is currently unfolding in the region can be attributed to the fact that the Gulf nations are selling off minority stakes in huge projects that deliver substantial financial returns.

Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, and other huge energy companies have raised astronomical sums of money by offloading minority stakes of their pipeline and infrastructure businesses to global investors.

The appetite for cash-generating, stable assets in the region is on the rise, evidenced by ADNOC’s $10.1 billion pipeline sale and Aramco’s $15.5 billion deal. Several buyers, including energy giant BlackRock, can rely on long-term financial returns that are sustainable and strengthen the Gulf nation’s energy companies’ financial footprint in the sector.

BlackRock is among several international companies aiming to expand their presence in the Gulf region, along with KKR and Brookfield, with BlackRock even setting up shop in Kuwait. The International Monetary Fund has noted that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is essential for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to shift away from over-reliance on hydrocarbon revenues and develop new, non-hydrocarbon sectors.

Gulf firms are turning their infrastructure into funding powerhouses in the current trend unfolding

The current trend of huge energy companies in the Gulf region selling off assets to bring in foreign investment is not limited to one nation, with the trend spreading from the UAE to Bahrain. The hope would be for the recent shift in the region to inspire other energy-rich regions in the world to follow the example set by the Gulf nations.

As the world is aiming to shift away from conventional energy generation towards the renewable energy sector, the cornerstone of the global energy industry is raking in billions of dollars, evidenced by the recent litany of deals taking place in the Gulf region.

Global industry insiders have praised the shift in the Gulf region regarding substantial foreign investments.

“To accelerate the region’s transformation and fulfill the GCC governments’ extensive economic goals, substantial private foreign investment is essential. The continued growth of the region’s economies could unlock considerable foreign direct investment (FDI) as international firms are keen to be a part of the region’s economic growth.” – Ernst & Young Global Limited

They’re also worsening tensions among administration officials responsible for all the chopping.

Last week, the Trump administration canceled about $8 billion in clean energy grants — mostly in Democratic states and districts — appearing to fulfill Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s promise to rein in Biden-era spending on wind, solar, battery and other energy technology he considers a “bridge to nowhere.”

But then a new, unconfirmed list of additional cuts surfaced, adding billions of dollars more to the potential total. Many of those newly targeted projects are in red states and districts, causing a week of confusion and heartburn on Capitol Hill. The fallout inside the White House and DOE could be even worse, Sophia Cai and Ben Lefebvre report.

“It’s toxic af over there,” one person who works with senior DOE staff told POLITICO via text. “The boys are fighting.”

The White House initially pushed back on Wright’s summer plan to cut grants, arguing that some of the funding could serve as leverage in negotiations with Congress and states, one administration official told Sophia and Ben. In other cases, an industry representative said, the White House wanted Wright to cancel projects he hoped to preserve.

Rival factions

The disagreement has heightened internal divisions at DOE, where rival factions are clashing over process and priorities, possibly delaying the release of a final list of projects on the chopping block.

Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill are still defending the administration amid the broader uncertainty of the government shutdown. “What’s happened is the White House has to make some very serious and difficult decisions,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the Republican whip, said at a Friday press conference when asked about the cuts.

It remains unclear how long the Trump administration and DOE can hold off a public revolt within their own ranks. Republicans are already under fire from Democrats over the government shutdown. And today the White House said it is making good on its promise to start firing more government workers, including at the Environmental Protection Agency and DOE (its so-called “reduction-in-force” plans).

Fresh backlash from constituents over canceled energy projects could add to their political headache.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), for example, told POLITICO’s Morning Energy this week that he’s pressing DOE to “stick with the things that they said they would do in North Dakota” after both a hydrogen and carbon capture project in the state showed up on the list of potential cuts.

Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a key backer of the $925 million ARCH2 hydrogen hub in her state — another project on that list — said Thursday she’s still seeking clarity.

“DOE told me that the list is just a broad list; there’s no real intent to cancel all those projects,” Capito said. “But some may get canceled, so it’s still just unclear.”

Clash in Illinois over how to lower electricity bills

Illinois lawmakers are negotiating a wide-ranging bill aimed at mitigating rising electricity costs and building more grid-scale energy storage.

Democratic leaders and clean energy advocates blame White House antipathy toward clean energy and the state’s grid operator for what they’re now calling an energy affordability crisis, Jeffrey Tomich writes. Lawmakers supporting the legislation say they want to insulate the state from swings in federal energy policy.

“Thanks to Trump’s chaotic leadership, our clean energy economy and climate are at great risk,” said state Rep. Ann Williams, who heads the Illinois Green Caucus. “We have to take action here in Illinois.”

Some Republicans and large energy users, however, say some parts of the bill will only increase electricity prices.

“This is a significant rate increase on every consumer in Illinois, whether it’s a homeowner, a school, a church, a retailer or manufacturer,” said Mark Denzler, CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers Association.

Coal pollution rose during last shutdown

Some types of air pollution from coal plants increased during the previous government shutdown as companies “strategically” sidestepped environmental rules, according to new research.

The findings from researchers note that the types of pollutants that increased during the shutdown of 2018 and 2019 were monitored by people who had to collect samples. Other types of pollutants are monitored by devices that automatically send data to EPA — and those types didn’t rise substantially, Ariel Wittenberg writes.

The fear among researchers and advocates is that the same could happen today. EPA sent its first furlough notices to staff on Thursday.

“I can’t believe we are in exactly the same situation again,” said Neha Khanna, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Binghamton University in New York who co-authored the research on emissions.

It had been one of a number of Nevada desert solar projects steadily advancing through regulatory review. Around 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under review by the Bureau of Land Management when Trump took office still await action.

That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project.

GEORGETOWN, Ky. (Oct. 10, 2025) – Toyota advanced its environmental sustainability efforts today with the launch of a new solar panel installation at its flagship manufacturing facility in Georgetown. The project was celebrated with a ribbon-cutting ceremony that brought together plant leadership, team members and community partners.

The nearly thirty-acre solar field marks a significant step forward in Toyota’s journey to reduce its carbon footprint and transition to renewable energy sources. The system is expected to generate approximately 15 million kilowatt hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power 1,400 average U.S. homes for a year.

“This project reflects our values and our commitment to being a good citizen,” said Chad Miller, vice president of manufacturing at Toyota Kentucky. “At Toyota, we believe in building more than just vehicles; we’re building a future. This solar installation is a powerful example of how we have aligned operations with our goals to reduce Toyota’s overall environmental footprint.”

The initiative supports Toyota’s broader environmental strategy, outlined in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, including the goal of making all its manufacturing facilities carbon neutral by 2035.

Just as the automaker is known for the built-in quality of its vehicles, Ebonye Allen, environmental engineering manager at Toyota, emphasized the importance of working toward sustainability in every aspect of its operations. “This isn’t just about renewable energy, it’s about reaffirming our commitments. Namely, our commitment to being good neighbors in the communities where we have operations and creating a robust company culture of environmental sustainability.”

Toyota Kentucky is the automaker’s largest facility globally, employing nearly 10,000 proud Kentuckians. The facility assembles the Camry Hybrid (America’s best-selling passenger car for 22 consecutive years), the RAV4 Hybrid (America’s best-selling SUV for 8 consecutive years), and the Lexus ES350.

Assembly of Toyota’s first battery electric vehicle in the U.S. is scheduled to begin at the plant in 2026.

NextStar Energy is expanding its manufacturing of EV battery cells and modules at its facility in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

NextStar Energy: EV battery manufacturer

NextStar Energy was formed in 2022 as a joint venture between LG Energy Solution and Stellantis.

The company is advancing battery manufacturing with the goal of promoting sustainable mobility solutions.

NextStar aims to be Canada’s first large-scale lithium ion battery production plant with its site in Ontario.

Stellantis and LG Energy Solution invested more than CAD$5bn (US$4.1bn) to construct the facility, with support from the Canadian government.

Danies Lee, CEO of NextStar Energy, says: “This achievement is the direct result of a shared vision, effective partnership and incredible hard work of everyone involved.

“As we transition from construction to operations, I am deeply grateful for the collaboration between our partner companies LG Energy Solution and Stellantis, our construction partner Alberici-Barton Malow, the City of Windsor, the provincial and federal governments and all who have supported our project to be completed safely and on schedule.”

The NextStar Energy facility

Construction began on the site in November 2022 and it has meant that 9,000 Canadian trade workers have contributed more than 8.4 million work hours.

NextStar Energy has received its Occupancy Permit for the cell manufacturing plant.

The permit marks the completion of the facility’s construction and brings the company closer to starting its operations.

It plans to begin in-house production of cells by the end of 2025.

The facility’s core operations include electrode production, cell formation and assembly and module assembly.

It is planned to have an annual production capacity of more than 45 gigawatt hours and will produce a target of 2,500 new job opportunities in the surrounding areas.

The company is committed to using sustainable business practices, including protecting the environment, upholding human rights and using resources responsibly.

Its aim is to create shared value, promote social growth and build a sustainable future.

NextStar will support Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan which aims to have more than 50% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales in North America by the end of the decade.

About battery module production

NextStar Energy began battery module production in 2024 by using externally sourced cells.

As operations begin, in-house cells will be used to manufacture battery modules.

The modules are grouped together in a battery pack, which is then used to power electric vehicles.

The site features 11 buildings including two main manufacturing facilities and nine support buildings.

The manufacturing facilities are separated into Cell and Module production and the support buildings include a recycling centre and safety testing laboratory.

The Occupancy Permit means that the facility is fully approved for safe occupancy and it is ready for production to begin.

Drew Dilkens, the Mayor of Windsor, Ontario, says: “Completion of construction and the granting of the Occupancy Permit marks a major milestone for the game-changing NextStar Energy battery manufacturing facility in Windsor.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c50d3e01bef6f6fde39c51ff7eb1cc08:13e5e6d6d25c49176f857b25a026a3d2/nextstar-energy.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:58:01.634760

Ken Paxton walked onto the stage with a pyrotechnic introduction.

Hundreds of young faces at the Texas Youth Summit, held outside of Houston last month, stared at Paxton as he boasted about the more than 120 combined lawsuits he filed against former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He recounted the obstacles he has overcome since becoming Texas attorney general a decade ago, including a historic impeachment that concluded with his acquittal. The crowd cheered.

He then made his pitch to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who Paxton said has been in office since the 62-year-old was in college.

“I just decided, you know what? It’s time that we have representation in Washington that will fight for us,” Paxton said to a roar of approval. “We deserve somebody that will fight for our constitutional rights.”

Paxton’s speech was among a series of recent stops the attorney general has made in front of young Republicans, a group that’s riding a surge in political momentum in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Paxton and other Republican candidates vying for one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats are trying to tap into that energy to gain an edge in the wide-open contest, betting that Kirk’s killing will galvanize turnout among a voting bloc that usually stays home during primaries.

In the last few weeks, Paxton said he would “look into” Texas Christian University for allegedly canceling an event with an anti-trans influencer, even though the school has said the event was never booked in the first place. This week, he spoke at a packed rally held by the Texas Tech University chapter of Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded when he was 18

He’s also the only Texan scheduled to speak at America Fest, Turning Point’s annual marquee event in December. He will share the stage with other grassroots GOP powerhouses like Donald Trump Jr., Steve Bannon and Kirk’s widow, Ericka.

Paxton “is special like President Trump in that he is the exception and not the rule,” said Christian Collins, a former congressional candidate and aide who founded the Texas Youth Summit in 2019.

Collins described Paxton as an accessible elected official who gave Collins his cellphone number the first time they met, and whom Collins often greets at events all over the state, where Paxton often speaks with activists and parents. “Ken Paxton is just a darling of the MAGA movement,” Collins said.

Still, Paxton is campaigning with a lot of baggage in tow. Despite emerging victorious in the political and legal battles he often brings up in front of audiences, some Republican strategists believe he could cost the party the Senate seat in a general election against a Democrat.

The accusations Paxton has weathered include committing securities fraud, abusing his office and having an extramarital affair.

The primary race also grew more crowded this week when U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, announced his bid for Cornyn’s seat. Hunt is a former Army combat veteran, a rising Republican star and an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump. He is also courting young voters: He was among the speakers at the Texas Youth Summit, and his campaign pointed to events where he has spoken at schools in his district.

“Young people are the future of this country, and as the youngest candidate in the race for U.S. Senate in Texas, I will bring a fresh perspective to the Senate,” Hunt, 43, said in a statement.

Cornyn’s campaign noted the senator headlined the Texas Young Republicans Federation convention the same weekend that Paxton and Hunt spoke at the conference in The Woodlands.

“Sen. Cornyn spends considerable time with young conservative professionals around Texas,” campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak said. “We will actively compete to win the votes of as many young Texas GOP primary voters as possible in this race.”

It remains to be seen whether the energy radiating through young conservatives in Texas and beyond will continue into the March primary and election day next year.

Texas’ young voters have historically made up a sliver of overall turnout in elections, including primaries, which are arguably the most important elections in Texas. While some years have seen voters under 30 sign up to vote in droves, they don’t always make it to the polls.

But Paxton and the other candidates may have good reason to believe that could change following Kirk’s killing on a Utah campus in early September.

Texas already has hundreds of Turning Point USA chapters, which help spur conservative activism, register voters and host events with GOP influencers and elected officials who fire up students and encourage them to continue their organizing.

The organization has received more than 120,000 inquiries since Kirk’s death to start new chapters across the nation, with a spokesperson recently saying, “We are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and college campus in America.”

“There is no question that Charlie Kirk’s assassination tragically, yet poignantly, has been a turning point for America and especially for conservatives,” Mackowiak said.

Ming Yang said the £1.5bn project would create up to 1,500 jobs, with the first production taking place by late 2028.

The firm, which is the largest private wind turbine manufacturer in China, has shortlisted the green freeport site at Ardersier as its preferred location for the facility.

Ming Yang said it would invest up to £750m in the first phase of its investment before expanding to create an ""offshore wind industry ecosystem"" around the hub.

It has been in talks with the Scottish and UK governments over the past two years.

The firm's UK chief executive, Aman Wang said: ""We firmly believe that by moving forward with our plans to create jobs, skills and a supply chain in the UK, we can make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.

""We fully support the government's mission to become a clean energy superpower, and I'm confident that once the plans are approved we can make a valued contribution to this goal.""

But a Conservative MP has previously questioned the wisdom of letting the company invest in the UK.

Last November, MP Nick Timothy asked UK energy minister Michael Shanks about Ming Yang's plans to invest in Scotland, saying the government should rule out investment from ""hostile states"".

Timothy said Ming Yang ""benefits from huge subsidies in China,"" adding any investment was subject to ""serious questions about energy and national security"".

The UK government's Energy Secretary, Michael Shanks, said he would ""encourage investment"".

In a statement released on Friday, a UK government spokesperson said: ""This is one of a number of companies that wants to invest in the UK.

""Any decisions made will be consistent with our national security.""

A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed the news that Ardersier had been chosen as Ming Yang's preferred location for investment.

""This port is strategically important to the growth and success of the offshore wind sector,"" they said.

""This illustrates the strength of opportunity and huge economic potential that the Scottish offshore wind sector offers.

§ 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status.
Bottom Line: A response to a broader deregulatory push by the current administration to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens, Order No.
913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice.","In short, not much.

On October 1, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued Order No. 913 (the “Order”) as a Direct Final Rule implementing Executive Order 14270, “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.”

The Order targets 53 outdated, “seldomly used,” or duplicative regulations, inserting conditional sunset provisions that will phase them out one year after the rule’s effective date—unless FERC extends the deadline by up to five years after soliciting and considering public comments on the costs and benefits of the regulations. The Order takes effect 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Two changes in particular apply to (1) certain transmission service applicants and (2) entities seeking to self-certify their exempt wholesale generator (“EWG”) or foreign utility company (“FUCO”) status. These changes will not impact any substantive requirements for these entities but will slightly relax the filing process by eliminating language regarding providing a form of notice of such filings.

18 C.F.R. § 36.1(b)(1) – Transmission Service Application Notices

Section 36.1(b)(1) of FERC’s regulations currently requires an applicant seeking transmission service under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act to include with its application a form of notice of the application suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the requirements of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations. That section, in turn, requires a “draft notice in accordance with the form of notice specifications prescribed by the Secretary and posted on the Commission’s website under Filing Procedures.”

Change:

This subsection will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the Order unless extended. Once sunsetted, applicants for Section 211 transmission services will no longer be bound by this notice requirement.

Impact:

Applications under Section 211 require a notice containing information about the transmission service requested and the facilities involved be provided to the parties potentially affected by the request, such as the transmission facilities owner, the relevant ISO/RTO, the interconnecting utility, and the state’s public utility commission. These requirements are set forth in Section 36.1(b)(2) of FERC’s regulations and are not changing. However, eliminating the form of notice requirement under Section 36.1(b)(1) will streamline the application process and relieve the filers from the requirement to follow an older notice format.

18 C.F.R. § 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings

Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status. Similarly to Section 36.1(b), Sections 366.7(a) and (b) require entities seeking to obtain EWG or FUCO status – either through a notice of self-certification or a petition for a declaratory order – to include a form of notice suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the specifications of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations.

Change:

These mandatory Federal Register form of notice provisions in Sections 366.7(a) and (b) will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the rule unless extended.

Impact:

This change has limited practical significance. FERC previously provided guidance that, at least in connection with a notice of self-certification of EWG or FUCO status, a form of notice is no longer required, stating that “[a]lthough the Commission’s regulations specify that a notice of self-certification should include a form of notice of the filing suitable for publication in the Federal Register, 18 C.F.R. § 366.7(a), it is no longer necessary to submit this form of notice.” However, removing this requirement from the regulations will align them with FERC’s current practice and will reduce confusion among filers.

Bottom Line:

A response to a broader deregulatory push by the current administration to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens, Order No. 913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice. With respect to Section 211 transmission service requests and EWG and FUCO filings, the Order does not change any of the substantive requirements for such filings, but removes the form of notice requirement from FERC’s regulations, thus simplifying and modernizing the regulations and, perhaps in some cases, streamlining the filing process.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14205_3939.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 03:59:06.891531

Following years of hints and pricing teases, EV giant Tesla just showed off its lower-cost trims, designed to drive volume without disrupting the lineup.

The market reaction, though, was immediate and surprisingly mixed, reflecting the tension between list prices and perceived step-up in value.

A quick read on Tesla's lower-cost options:

Models/prices: Model 3 at $36,990; Model Y at $39,990.

Hardware/software: Familiar packages marked by incremental updates through Tesla’s over-the-air updates.

Target buyer: First-time EV shoppers backed by fleet and mass-market channels.

First read: Stock is down 4% on launch day.

Despite the drop, though, Tesla stock is in the green year-to-date, while its three-month performance is even more impressive at 47%.

Over the past few months, its tape has turned explosive, following a steady spring rally as shares ripped through Q3, capped by September’s 35% moonshot. Stacking the last six months, the incredible run clocks in at roughly 90% on compounded math.

That’s where longtime Tesla bull and veteran tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush drops in with a healthy new target, and a caveat. He didn’t mince words on the budget EV development, but did drop an explosive new price target. However, the upside pivots on a different engine of value entirely.

Dan Ives hikes Tesla target but slams “uninspired” budget EVs

Wedbush tech analyst Daniel Ives didn't hold back on Tesla’s new low-cost models, calling them “relatively disappointing,” stating that the features and pricing fall short of sparking fresh demand.

Tesla’s latest move was intended to offset the loss of U.S. EV tax credits and revitalize deliveries toward a 500,000-unit quarterly run rate. Instead, the market yawned, and investors are viewing the trims as a $5,000 markdown instead of a true product refresh.

Ives called it more of a “pricing tactic, not a catalyst,” arguing the models genuinely lack differentiation and come at a time when BYD, Nio, and XPeng are gobbling up Tesla’s lunch in global EV sales.

Surprisingly, however, he maintained his buy rating and reaffirmed his Street-high $600 price target, implying a massive 37% upside from current levels, based on Tesla’s AI and autonomy pipeline.

He points to the successful June launch of Tesla’s Robotaxi service in Austin, early traction for Full Self-Driving version 14, and AI-trained humanoid robots driving the company’s real valuation drivers.

In his view, Tesla’s next leg of expansion has less to do with it cutting stickier prices and more to do with proving its software is worth a premium that the rest of the market can’t match.

Quick takeaways:

Ives unimpressed: Wedbush’s Daniel Ives called Tesla’s new Model 3 and Model Y “relatively disappointing,” saying that pricing tweaks won’t drive new demand.

Market reaction: Shares fell 4% on launch day, with investors viewing the rollout as a simple markdown on the back of cutthroat competition from BYD, Nio, and XPeng.

AI remains the bet: Ives still backs Tesla’s AI future and keeps a buy rating with a $600 target (37% upside).

Chinese rivals are outrunning Tesla on 2025 deliveries

China’s EV heavyweights are setting a blistering tone as they continue widening their lead over Tesla.

For perspective, EV front-runner BYD sold 396,270 new-energy vehicles (NEVs) in September, up 6% sequentially, while capping Q3 at 1.11 million units as it shifted further toward pure EVs. Through September, the company’s year-to-date tally stands at an eye-catching 3.26 million, well ahead of every global rival.

XPeng is also surging from a smaller base, posting a record 41,581 September deliveries (+95% year over year, +10% sequentially) and 116,007 units in Q3 (a 149% jump from last year). As it stands, the EV upstart’s nine-month total of 313,196 already dwarfs 2024’s full-year output.

On top of that, Nio isn’t far behind, delivering 34,749 vehicles in September (up 64% year over year) and 87,071 in Q3 (up 41% year over year), both records that underscore the company’s turnaround in volumes and momentum.

Tesla hit a record 497,099 global deliveries in Q3, but its lead is shrinking quickly. In 2025 volumes, BYD’s roughly 1.6 million pure EVs outpaced Tesla’s near 1.2 million, a clear reversal of leadership in global all-electric sales.

Looking at the most recent stretch, the pattern is just as clear.

BYD delivered nearly 770,000 vehicles across August and September combined, while XPeng strung together three consecutive monthly records (36,000 in July, 37,709 in August, and 41,581 in September).

Similarly, Nio climbed steadily as its deliveries came in at 21,017 in July, 31,305 in August, and 34,749 in September.

Each company is marching forward with aplomb into the final quarter, posting superb gains that highlight how quickly China’s EV ecosystem is growing compared with Tesla’s steadier pace.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/t_share/MjEzNjIxNjQwMjU5NDQ2MjIz/elon-musk-not-happy.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 22:59:42.429879

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT CLIMATE AND DEMOCRACY

STATE NEWS

STATES ADVANCE CLEAN ENERGY AMIDST FEDERAL ATTACKS: As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans attack clean energy, state leaders are enacting policies to advance clean energy, which will lower energy costs and pollution. Across the nation, state and local leaders are taking legislative and executive action to protect the environment, lower utility bills, and reduce pollution.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of State Policy and Advocacy Bill Holland said, “State and local leaders continue to provide a different path focused on deploying clean energy at scale, reducing pollution, and lowering utility bills. In recent weeks, we’ve seen actions like California governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order to speed up clean energy projects eligible for federal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits before they expire, and New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherril’s No Rate Hikes pledge that she made on the campaign trail last month. These actions follow months of significant steps taken at the state level to build renewables and protect ratepayers around the country.

“In partnership with groups across the country, the League of Conservation Voters’ state affiliates in the Conservation Voter Movement have rallied the public and won meaningful progress nationwide. Together, they understand that our collective response has never been more important. State action is critical to not only hold the line against federal attacks, but to keep the country moving forward on climate.”

STATES STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY AGAINST AUTHORITARIANISM: As the Trump administration attempts to dismantle our democracy at the federal level, LCV partners in the Conservation Voters Movement (CVM) are working overtime to secure major democracy victories in the states. From legal protections for voters of color to fighting partisan gerrymandering, states continue to make progress to protect voting rights and fight authoritarianism.

OUR TAKE: LCV State Democracy Policy Senior Director Amanda Gnaedinger said, “States across the country are fighting to defend a free and fair democracy. Our best course of action for a stronger democracy is to not only protect fundamental freedoms, but expand democracy so it is a responsive and trusted institution for all people—no matter their race, income, ability, or zip code. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) along with over 30 state partners, collectively called the Conservation Voters Movement (CVM), has worked this year to successfully secure legal protections for voters, lessen the damage of Trump’s Project 2025 agenda, and slow the creep of authoritarianism into state legislatures in state houses around the country.

“The relentless attacks on our communities and freedoms coincide with environmental and energy policies that are leading to higher costs, more pollution, and more extreme weather. These challenges cannot be solved through advocacy if we are left with an unresponsive, unrepresentative democracy. Therefore, in order for everyone to enjoy clear air and water, public lands, and affordable clean energy, we must all rise to make sure our government can hear us, protect us, and reflect us all.”

INDIANA RALLIES AGAINST PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING: Vice President J.D. Vance visited Indiana to pressure lawmakers to redraw congressional maps and eliminate the two seats held by Democrats. In response, Indiana Conservation Voters (ICV) held a rally to tell Indiana lawmakers: No mid-decade map meddling. ICV has led the charge over the past month in opposition to map manipulation, including early rallies and delivering thousands of petition signatures to legislative leadership.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters said, “Hoosiers have been more than clear on this issue over the past two months: We don’t want Washington outsiders telling us how to run our state. Attempts to redraw Indiana’s legislative maps in the middle of the decade are unfair, unnecessary and out of step with hard-working Hoosiers’ priorities.

“What’s more, they want to come into our state and tell us what to do with our legislative process while the federal government is shut down. Maybe they should just stay in Washington and clean up their own mess instead of disrupting our lives and our state with their political shenanigans.

“Indiana leaders should continue to reject this distraction from D.C. and stay focused on the real issues that matter to Hoosiers: inflation, energy costs and taxes.”

OREGON MOVES TO FAST TRACK CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS: Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed an executive order to accelerate renewable energy projects before federal tax credits expire. The executive order will focus Oregon’s agencies to speed up its permitting process to complete energy projects that create jobs, build energy capacity, and lower costs.

OLCV TAKE: Oregon League of Conservation Voters said, “Federal tax credits for renewable energy projects will expire next year, due to the elimination of these incentives by the Trump Administration. However, thanks to Governor Tina Kotek’s Executive Order, Oregon will speed up its otherwise lengthy permitting process to get these projects underway before the deadline. This Executive Order defends Oregon families, family-wage jobs, and our state’s energy resilience. We’re glad to see Oregon leading, joining a handful of states who have sped up their processes as well.”

ARIZONA RALLIES COMMUNITY TO DEMAND ENERGY JUSTICE FROM APS: Chispa AZ and community members burdened by $300–$500 monthly bills and record-breaking heat gathered outside the Arizona Public Service (APS) substation wall to protest the utility’s latest proposed rate hikes. Organizers called out the company for fueling the climate crisis and shifting costs onto communities already most impacted.

CHISPA NEVADA HONORED WITH GREEN IMPACT AWARD: Chispa Nevada was honored with the Green Impact Award at the Nevada Conservation League’s Home Means Nevada 2025 Awards Dinner. The award recognizes locally rooted organizations leading the way on environmental and climate justice. Chispa NV was celebrated for its community-driven advocacy to ensure cleaner air, renewable energy, and a more equitable future for Nevada’s families.

NATIONAL NEWS

KAINE, HEINRICH MOVE TO END TRUMP’S SHAM ENERGY EMERGENCY: Senators Tim Kaine (VA) and Martin Heinrich (NM) reintroduced a resolution to terminate the sham Trump Energy Emergency order, which was designed to line the pockets of Big Oil rather than lowering energy costs. The resolution failed after senators voted along party lines.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Federal Advocacy Campaigns Director Leah Donahey said, “Democrats are fighting back to address rising costs by voting unanimously to reject Trump’s energy emergency order. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans continue to do the bidding of Big Oil at the expense of hardworking families. At a time when energy demand is increasing and costs are skyrocketing, we should be focused on deploying the cheapest and fastest energy – clean wind, solar, and batteries. Yet Trump and Republicans continue to cancel cheaper, faster, and more reliable clean energy projects daily. The Trump administration is determined to prioritize the agenda of billionaire CEOs by forcing expensive coal-fired plants to stay open, selling off our public lands to drilling and mining, and canceling clean energy initiatives. We applaud Senators Kaine and Heinrich for continuing to push back against Trump’s sham, which is designed only to line the pockets of Big Oil CEOs and put the health, affordability, and safety of our communities at risk. We are all in to continue fighting for clean energy incentives and projects that keep costs low and work for everyone.”

HOUSE DEMOCRATS CONDEMN CANCELLATION OF $8 BILLION IN ENERGY PROJECTS: Last week, the Trump administration and the Department of Energy announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in clean energy projects in politically targeted states. Over 160 House Democrats wrote a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemning the likely illegal action, which will eliminate jobs, weaken our electric grids, and raise electricity prices.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS’ TAKE: From the letter, “This decision is a reversal of properly awarded projects that will harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge. This Administration’s decision to play political games will result in genuine harm at a time when millions of American families are already struggling to pay their electricity bills amidst the everrising cost of living. These blatantly partisan cancellations must immediately be reversed.

“The projects that the Department of Energy (DOE) has unilaterally decided to cancel were driving down costs for all our constituents—regardless of their political affiliation. Household electric bills have already increased 10% nationally since January 2025 and are poised to spike even further. This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

TRUMP ADMIN ROLLS BACK PROTECTIONS FOR ALASKA WILDERNESS: President Trump signed an executive order approving the Ambler Road Project in Alaska. This decision opens up Alaska’s treasured public lands for mining, threatening local communities and the environment.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “While the government is shut down for the people, Trump is making sure it stays open for billionaire polluters. Approving the Ambler Road Project ignores science, years of engagement with Alaska Native communities, and public input. This reckless decision will harm the health of Alaska Native communities and their way of life and Alaska’s wildlife and treasured public lands of the Brooks Range and Gates of the Arctic. This is just the latest example of Trump continuing to give away our public lands despite the fact that these sell offs are deeply unpopular amongst the majority of people across the country.”

167 MILLION ACRES OF FEDERAL LANDS AUCTIONED OFF FOR COAL: The Trump administration hosted a coal lease sale in Montana auctioning off 167 million tons of coal on federal lands. The auction drew only one bid for $186,000, just one-tenth of a penny per ton of recoverable coal. Even taking into consideration the new cut rates for coal set by the Trump administration, the bid was rejected by BLM. This flop of a lease sale exemplifies that, in addition to damaging surrounding environments and public health, coal is inefficient and unpopular.

It is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.

He singled out the endangerment finding, as “the holy grail of the climate change religion” and said he was thrilled to end it.

The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US.

Three former EPA leaders have criticized Zeldin, saying his March proposal would endanger the lives of millions of Americans and abandon the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

“If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,” Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under the Republican president George W Bush, said after Zeldin’s plan was made public.

As a result, Texas is moving forward once again with its Texas Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan, originally approved in 2022. The plan faced an uncertain future after the suspension of $5 billion in federal funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which aims to make EV ownership more accessible by supporting robust charging infrastructure across the country.

The Texas plan remains largely the same following the freeze, but the federal level requirements and guidelines for the NEVI program as a whole have shifted slightly: states are no longer required to place chargers no less than 50 miles apart, and can decide individually what a reasonable distance is (though Texas has opted to stay true to the original guidelines, according to its own EV Infrastructure Plan). This change actually could aid in the acceleration of EV infrastructure adaptation in many states, as the 50 mile rule led to complications and slow downs during the first three years of the NEVI program.

The Federal Highway Administration also no longer requires states to factor in extreme weather evacuations in site placement or make an effort to benefit disadvantaged communities in their plans.

Texas to invest nearly half a billion in EV charging

According to Texas’ plan, Texas will invest over $400 million from the federal government and $77 million from the private sector to strategically place EV charging stations every 50 miles along interstate highways (deemed “Alternative Fuel Corridors”) during phase 1, and every 50-70 miles in some rural areas during phase 2. There are 84 planned interstate highway stations, supplemented by 34 Volkswagen-funded stations. Each station will feature a minimum of four DC fast-charging ports, capable of charging most EVs from 10% to 80% in just 30 minutes. To ensure accessibility, all stations will be located within one mile of the highway.

Looking ahead, the plan outlines a broader statewide expansion, aiming to bring EV charging infrastructure to rural counties, small urban areas, and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). A key feature includes placing at least one station at or near every county seat not already served by an interstate station, ensuring comprehensive geographic coverage, and tallying up to an additional 190 stations. These are expected to be built following the completion of all phase 1 stations.

For context, most low to mid-range EVs can travel 120–200 miles on an 80% charge. With stations spaced no more than 70 miles apart, Texans will be able to confidently traverse the state with minimal risk of running out of charge — a major step forward in making electric transportation practical across Texas.

Ten NEVI charging stations now operational in Texas

The first three NEVI charging stations in Texas were unveiled in December of 2024, and there are now 10 operational stations as of September 2025! For 15 more stations, construction is already underway or will begin shortly; at least eight new stations are expected to be completed and operational by the end of 2025. In addition, there are 44 stations currently in the planning stage. See below for a full list of open and under construction stations.

Since the 2020 fiscal year, the number of electric vehicles registered in Texas have increased by more than 9 times, increasing by 805% from 36,418 to 329,642. By 2028, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimates that there will be 1 million EVs on Texas roads. With electric vehicle adoption rates rapidly rising, accommodating the increasing demand is imperative.

,American Energy,2025-10-11 00:18:31+00:00,Heatmap News,The Fiscal Contradictions of Trump's Energy Policy - Heatmap News,Emily Pontecorvo,,,,,https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-energy-contradictions,"The Department of Energy justified terminating hundreds of congressionally-mandated grants issued by the Biden administration for clean energy projects last week (including for a backup battery at a children’s hospital) by arguing that they were bad investments for the American people.
The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation.
Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain.
The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability.
In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing.","The Department of Energy justified terminating hundreds of congressionally-mandated grants issued by the Biden administration for clean energy projects last week (including for a backup battery at a children’s hospital) by arguing that they were bad investments for the American people.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency’s press release said.

It’s puzzling, then, that the Trump administration is pouring vast government resources into saving aging coal plants and expediting advanced nuclear projects — two sources of energy that are famously financial black holes.

The Energy Department announced it would invest $625 million to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” in late September. Earlier this year, the agency also made $900 million available to “unlock commercial deployment of American-made small modular reactors.”

It’s hard to imagine what economic yardsticks would warrant funding to keep coal plants open. The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation. Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain. “You can put all the money you want into a clunker, but at the end of the day, it’s really old, and it’s just going to keep getting more expensive over time, even if you have a short term fix,” Michelle Solomon, a program manager at Energy Innovation who authored the research, told me.

Keeping these plants online — even if they only operate some of the time— inevitably raises electricity bills. That’s because in many of the country’s electricity markets, the cost of power on any given day is determined by the most expensive plant running. On a hot summer day when everyone’s air conditioners are working hard and the grid operator has to tell a coal plant to switch on to meet demand, every electron delivered in the region will suddenly cost the same as coal, even if it was generated essentially for free by the sun or wind.

The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability. In theory, coal generation should be available around the clock. But in reality, the plants aren’t necessarily up to the task — and not just because they’re old. Sandy Creek in Texas, which began operating in 2013 and is the newest coal plant in the country, experienced a major failure this past April and is now expected to stay offline until 2027, according to the region’s grid operator. In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing. This is in part due to wear and tear from the way these plants cycle on and off to accommodate renewable energy sources, the report said, but it’s also due to reduced maintenance as plant operators plan to retire the facilities.

“You can do the deferred maintenance. It might keep the plant operating for a bit longer, but at the end of the day, it’s still not going to be the most efficient source of energy, or the cheapest source of energy,” Solomon said.

The contradictions snowball from there. On September 30, the DOE opened a $525 million funding opportunity for coal plants titled “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” inviting coal-fired power plants that are scheduled for retirement before 2032 or in rural areas to apply for grants that will help keep them open. The grant paperwork states that grid capacity challenges “are especially acute in regions with constrained transmission and sustained load growth.” Two days later, however, as part of the agency’s mass termination of grants, it canceled more than $1.3 billion in awards from the Grid Deployment Office to upgrade and install new transmission lines to ease those constraints.

The new funding opportunity may ultimately just shuffle awards around from one coal plant to another, or put previously-awarded projects through the time-and-money-intensive process of reapplying for the same funding under a new name. Up to $350 million of the total will go to as many as five coal plants, with initial funding to restart closed plants or to modernize old ones, and later phases designated for carbon capture, utilization, and storage retrofits. The agency said it will use “unobligated” money from three programs that were part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program, the Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Projects, and the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas Program.

In a seeming act of cognitive dissonance, however, the agency has canceled awards for two coal-fired power plants that the Biden administration made under those same programs. One, a $6.5 million grant to Navajo Transitional Energy Company, a tribal-owned entity that owns a stake in New Mexico’s Four Corners Generating Station, would have funded a study to determine whether adding carbon capture and storage to the plant was economically viable. The other, a $50 million grant to TDA Research that would have helped the company validate its CCS technology at Dry Fork Station, a coal plant in Wyoming, was terminated in May.

Two more may be out the window. A new internal agency list of grants labeled “terminate” that circulated this week included an $8 million grant for the utility Duke Energy to evaluate the feasibility of capturing carbon from its Edwardsport plant in Indiana, and $350 million for Project Tundra, a carbon capture demonstration project at the Milton R. Young Station in North Dakota.

“It’s not internally consistent,” Jack Andreason Cavanaugh, a global fellow at the Columbia University’s Carbon Management Research Initiative, told me. “You’re canceling coal grants, but then you’re giving $630 million to keep them open. You’re also investing a ton of time and money into nuclear — which is great, to be clear — but these small modular reactors haven’t been deployed in the United States, and part of the reason is that they’re currently not economically viable.”

The closest any company has come thus far to deploying a small modular reactor in the U.S. is NuScale, a company that planned to build its first-of-a-kind reactors in Idaho and had secured agreements to sell the power to a group of public utilities in Utah. But between 2015, when it was first proposed, and late 2023, when it died, the project’s budget tripled from $3 billion to more than $9 billion, while its scale was reduced from 600 megawatts to 462 megawatts. Not all of that was inevitable — costs rose dramatically in the final few years due to inflation. The reason NuScale ultimately pulled out of the project is that the cost of electricity it generated was going to be too high for the market to bear.

It’s unclear how heavily the DOE will weigh project financials in the application process for the $900 million for nuclear reactors. In its funding announcement, it specified that the awards would be made “solely based on technical merit.” The agency’s official solicitation paperwork, however, names “financial viability” as one of the key review criteria. Regardless, the Trump administration appears to recognize the value in funding first-of-a-kind, risky technologies when it comes to nuclear, but is not applying the same standards to direct air capture or hydrogen plants.

I asked the Department of Energy to share the criteria it used in the project review process to determine economic viability. In response, spokesperson Ben Dietderich encouraged me to read Wright’s memorandum describing the review process from May. The memo outlines what types of documentation the agency will evaluate to reach a decision, but not the criteria for making that decision.

Solomon agreed that advanced nuclear might one day meet the grid’s growing power needs, but not anytime soon. “Hopefully in the long term, this technology does become a part of our electricity system. But certainly relying on it in the short term has real risks to electricity costs,” she said. “And also reliability, in the sense that the projects might not materialize.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTczMTAzNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzU1MjA2OH0.MQk2floJC0HebPHKp-gujW4uQNvrZXpP7vLup0F3ms4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-10 23:00:06.172299

A solar generator operates by using solar panels to convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity. The energy is stored in a high-capacity battery, with a charge controller managing the flow. An inverter then converts the stored DC power into alternating current (AC) for use with standard appliances.

This technology produces clean energy without emitting pollutants. It supports sustainable living practices and lessens reliance on the traditional power grid. For families aiming for more self-sufficiency, these systems offer energy independence and a reduced environmental footprint.

Unlike traditional generators that have ongoing fuel expenses, a solar generator can offer long-term savings. With fewer moving parts than conventional systems, they require less maintenance. This design results in lower operational costs and helps ensure the system is ready when needed.

The practical capability of these units is shown in their emergency performance. For instance, a 2,000Wh unit can theoretically power a 100W device for approximately 20 hours, depending on factors such as battery type and efficiency. This capacity can sustain appliances like refrigerators and communication tools during a grid interruption.

Solar Emergency Charger provides homeowners with reliable and user-friendly solar power stations. The company serves as a resource for families looking to add a modern, sustainable energy source to their preparedness plans.

Stevenson, Carlos Anchondo, Scott Waldman, Heather Richards, Benjamin Storrow",,,,,https://www.eenews.net/articles/blm-cancels-largest-solar-project-in-north-america/,"They predicted the Esmeralda 7 project — by far the largest solar project that had moved through the permitting process under former President Joe Biden’s Interior Department — won’t be the last major project in the pipeline to be pulled.
The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada.
That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.
It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands.
Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.","The Trump administration’s cancellation of what would have been one of the world’s largest solar power projects has some industry observers fretting over the future of renewable energy on public lands.

They predicted the Esmeralda 7 project — by far the largest solar project that had moved through the permitting process under former President Joe Biden’s Interior Department — won’t be the last major project in the pipeline to be pulled. It was one of a number of Nevada desert solar projects that had been steadily advancing through regulatory review by the Biden administration.

Scott Sklar, sustainable energy director at George Washington University’s Environment & Energy Management Institute, said the Trump administration had set up a “multitude of regulatory barriers and delays.” These delays, he added, have placed financial strain on the renewable energy companies with projects waiting for review and could lead to others walking away from pending projects.

“The administration wants to stop these projects, period, so there is no chance for approval,” he said.

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, agreed. “As the Trump administration continues to take actions hostile to renewable energy projects, that may not be the last solar project on federal land to cancel,” he said.

The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 project to note that the environmental review of the project was “cancelled.”

The decision to cancel the programmatic environmental impact statement was described by a federal government official with knowledge of the situation, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly, as a mutual decision by BLM and the handful of companies that had proposed the seven individual solar power projects that would have comprised Esmeralda 7.

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

Representatives with the energy companies involved in developing the seven individual solar power plants that collectively comprised the Esmeralda 7 project did not respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration has made its skepticism of the solar build-out in Nevada clear in recent months, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and other officials saying solar is an “intermittent” technology that doesn’t provide reliable energy. But some conservationists alarmed by the proposed rollout of large solar projects in Nevada and other Western states celebrated the demise of Esmeralda 7, saying as designed it took up up far too much land.

“Friends of Nevada Wilderness is thrilled that this poorly sited project is dead,” said Shaaron Netherton, the group’s executive director.

“In the push to get this particular project through, the BLM ignored the importance of this region’s cultural significance, biological significance and the fact that it is one of the most intact landscapes remaining in Nevada,” Netherton added.

BLM in July 2024 issued a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project and had originally planned to issue a final review document in April.

Around 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under at least preliminary review by BLM when President Donald Trump took office still await action.

That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.

What’s more, two major solar projects that were issued records of decision in the final weeks of the Biden administration have since sat in limbo — the Jove Solar Project in southwest Arizona and the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project in southern Nevada, with a combined capacity to power 350,000 homes.

Burgum and his department have increasingly tightened the restrictions on solar and wind projects. Burgum signed a secretarial order that directed officials to eliminate policies granting “preferential treatment” for wind and solar development on federal lands and waters. The department also issued guidance to agency leaders that Burgum and Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor would need to review a long list of procedural decisions for those projects.

Burgum in August also signed an order that requires Interior to consider “capacity density” when evaluating solar and wind projects, which could hinder them because they tend to take up more land than other kinds of energy development.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email Friday that the industry needs “further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process,” but that they “remain deeply concerned” about the administration’s recent actions that appear aimed at slowing solar development on federal lands.

“We need more power on the grid, fast, and the solar and storage industry is ready to provide it,” Norris said, “but we need the administration to get serious about truly achieving American energy dominance.”

Concerns about project’s size

The Esmeralda 7 project was ambitious by most any measure.

It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands. If built as imagined, it could have produced about 5,350 MW of electricity — enough to power nearly 2 million homes.

Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.

On the surface, at least, the project appeared to be proposed in an ideal spot in Esmeralda County.

The federal government controls 98 percent of the county’s 2.2 million acres, and BLM accounts for the vast majority of that — managing 2.1 million acres there.

There’s not a single incorporated town, and only about 729 residents, ranking it among the 20 least populated counties in the nation, with the nation’s second-lowest population density of residents per square mile.

But the project had garnered concerns about its sheer size and the potential for it to disturb migratory patterns for wildlife.

Conservation advocates, local government leaders and nearby residents have expressed concerns about the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed Esmeralda 7 project, which in addition to covering a huge swath of desert lands would have also included miles of roads and associated transmission lines.

They have argued for placing onshore utility-scale projects on previously disturbed sites and expanding the use of rooftop solar.

The Esmeralda 7 project “would have destroyed significant archaeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands,” said Kevin Emmerich, a co-founder of Nevada-based Basin and Range Watch.

The cancellation of the project “will give us a chance to protect the tremendous resources of the area, including beautiful and wild mountain ranges and valleys, rare plant populations, and bighorn sheep,” said Laura Cunningham, a biologist with Western Watersheds Project.

“Paleontological fossil beds [the Esmeralda Formation] here were formative to understanding the geological history of the Great Basin,” Cunningham added. “This is good news for recreationists and for conservation efforts of an amazing landscape.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/4a/db/0757e1e94a558b25616284763f8a/29730315801-859a5b0540-c-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 21:01:08.001022

The 11 states leading the effort announced October 10 are co-chairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Wyoming, and participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

“The new Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative is critical to moving new nuclear projects forward across the country,” said David Terry, NASEO President. “The initiative is among the most important actions taken collectively by states to date to catalyze investment in historic levels of firm, clean electric power development to serve consumers, businesses and the nation as a whole for decades to come.”

NASEO last month issued a Request for Information to provide states with information on a structure for an advanced nuclear project “order book” strategy, including the status and use cases for different nuclear technologies, and investment and coordination models.

The order book approach moves away from one-off projects to propel widespread market adoption of the most viable technologies that can be deployed across multiple states. This includes assessing the readiness of different advanced reactor designs to meet different power needs identified by states, which will speed project development and lower costs. NASEO, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department of Energy Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear coordinated with the states to advance the RFI.

A cornerstone of the overall First Mover initiative is forming public-private partnerships with interested utilities, nuclear technology developers, project developers, energy end-users (e.g., consumers, data centers, manufacturers), investors and others. NASEO and the First Mover states are working with the U.S. Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Congress to accelerate advanced nuclear projects.

About the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative

The First Mover initiative, directed by state energy offices, is led by state co-chairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Wyoming, and participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia. The governors of these states are committed to delivering advanced nuclear power rapidly, safely, and cost-effectively to ensure consumers and businesses have reliable, affordable, sustainable electricity for years to come.

These states seek to accelerate advanced nuclear projects by reducing financial and technology risks, devising supportive market adoption policies, defining supply chain needs, streamlining federal permitting, developing coordinated procurement options, exploring state-federal-private financing structures, and creating public-private partnerships.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced New York’s participation in the initiative during her “State of the State Address” in January. “New York is proud to co-lead the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative, which demonstrates our commitment to the exploration of innovative technologies to achieve a reliable and affordable electric system for New York families,” Hochul said. “New York looks forward to partnering with other states that want to find ways to meet growing energy demand, pursue economic development opportunities, and who share the same vision for a sustainable energy future.”

“The state of Indiana is committed to identifying the strongest pathways for advancing new nuclear projects,” said Indiana Gov. Mike Braun. “By co-leading the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative, Indiana will be able to facilitate innovative new partnerships across states and industry, identify supportive policy mechanisms, and develop new tools for decreasing project risk.”

The legislation, co-sponsored by the California Professional Firefighters and the California State Association of Electrical Workers, is aimed at strengthening coordination with fire authorities and preventing safety incidents.
It is introduced in the aftermath of a major fire at the Moss Landing battery storage facility in Monterey County.
“California must prioritize safety at every step when expanding battery storage to meet its clean energy goals,” said Senator Laird.","Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 283, authored by Senator John Laird, introducing new safety requirements for the development of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in California. While the bill enhances oversight and safety, it is also expected to increase the cost of battery storage development in the state.

The legislation, co-sponsored by the California Professional Firefighters and the California State Association of Electrical Workers, is aimed at strengthening coordination with fire authorities and preventing safety incidents. It is introduced in the aftermath of a major fire at the Moss Landing battery storage facility in Monterey County.

The site, part of the Vistra Power Plant, is the largest operational battery project in the United States.. The fire at a 300 MW lithium-ion storage system triggered the evacuation of more than 1,200 residents and led to the temporary closure of surrounding roads. While all on-site personnel were safely evacuated and no injuries were reported, the event raised significant concerns about the safety of large-scale energy storage facilities.

“California must prioritize safety at every step when expanding battery storage to meet its clean energy goals,” said Senator Laird. “SB 283 ensures that future battery storage facilities are developed with safety and the community in mind, and that our fire officials are involved in every step along the way. I thank Governor Newsom for signing this bill to protect first responders, local communities, and the integrity of our renewable energy transition.”

Under SB 283, battery storage developers will be required to meet with the local fire authority at least 30 days prior to submitting an application for a new project. This consultation must cover key safety aspects, including facility design, risk assessments, and emergency response planning, in alignment with requirements under SB 38. In addition, developers will be required to arrange and pay for a post-installation inspection of the facility by the local fire authority before the system is allowed to begin operation.

The bill also directs the state to review building standards related to battery storage. As part of the next update to the California Building Standards Code after July 1, 2026, the Office of the State Fire Marshal will be required to evaluate and potentially propose siting restrictions. This may include limiting installations to dedicated-use, noncombustible buildings or outdoor locations to reduce fire risk.

Initially, SB 283 included a provision requiring battery storage projects to comply with the National Fire Protection Association’s NFPA 855 standards. However, this requirement was removed from the final bill after the Office of the State Fire Marshal independently adopted the latest NFPA 855 standards in March 2025. These standards are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026, making further legislation on the matter unnecessary.

“Senate Bill 283 is a critical step forward in protecting both our firefighters and the communities they serve,” said Brian K. Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters. “By strengthening safety standards for battery storage facilities and ensuring local fire authorities have a seat at the table through the meet-and-confer process, this law puts responsibility where it belongs — on the owners and operators of these facilities — and helps prevent disasters before they start.”

According to a release from Prometheus, the project is expected to include a minimum of $500 million in initial investment and to deliver up to 1.5 gigawatts of IT-ready capacity over multiple phases.

First IT-ready power is targeted for 2026.

Project Overview

The Casper project and strategic partnership are designed to meet accelerating demand for AI compute capacity while embedding carbon removal into the project’s core. It unifies three pillars:

Data Infrastructure: Prometheus Hyperscale will design and finance high-density compute halls using proprietary aquifer, non-consumptive water-cooling systems to maximize energy efficiency.

Energy Systems: Spiritus builds on its work in Wyoming with its new platform, Orchard Power, which will deliver 1.5 GW of on-site firm power fueled by natural gas, integrated point-source and direct air capture to drive fast, affordable, carbon-negative operations.

Carbon Sequestration: Casper Carbon Capture will provide land, rights-of-way and access to permitted CO2 sequestration wells in Natrona and Converse counties, ensuring permanent storage of captured emissions.

This new data center development builds on Prometheus’s initiatives in Wyoming and Texas. In Evanston is the company’s flagship project: scaling toward 1 GW+ IT capacity, with partnerships for low-carbon natural gas, nuclear SMR power and organic flow battery systems.

In Texas are partnerships with ENGIE North America and Conduit Power to co-locate AI data centers alongside renewable and hybrid power systems across the Interstate 35 corridor.

The project is expected to generate hundreds of construction jobs during the building phase and dozens of long-term technical positions upon completion. The project will also expand the tax base by generating new property, utility and infrastructure revenues for Natrona and Converse counties.

“We’re excited to develop another project in Wyoming,” Prometheus CEO Trenton Thornock said in the release. “The Casper project and this partnership with Spiritus and Casper Carbon Capture further enables Prometheus’ vision of developing the future of digital infrastructure sustainably.”

(WSAV) — State leaders are looking for new ways to keep electric vehicle (EV) interest charged up — after federal tax credits for EV buyers expired at the end of September.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, created under the ‘Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,’ had offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. But a bill signed in July shortened its end date from 2032 to September 30, 2025, effectively ending the incentive early.

‘Range Anxiety’ No Longer a Major Issue

EV owners say Georgia’s expanding charging infrastructure is helping ease common concerns about long-distance travel.

“The charging network in Georgia is really being built out in a very robust and easy way,” said James Marlow, President of Southface and an EV owner. “When I drive to the Georgia coast, it’s no problem to stop, charge, and grab food or coffee. Charging is becoming much less of an issue.”

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Georgia now has over 90,000 registered EVs and about 2,200 charging stationsstatewide.

Local Incentives May Be the Next Step

With federal credits now gone, experts say car manufacturers and local governments may need to step in with new incentives to keep buyers interested.

“The withdrawal of incentives has definitely changed the market,” Marlow said. “But if you zoom out, electric vehicles now make up about 10% of the U.S. new car market — and that’s growing.”

He also pointed to falling battery costs, which are expected to make EVs more affordable in the coming years.

Cheaper to Operate, Easier to Charge

“I have a Tesla 3, and a full charge to 80% costs me about $12,” Marlow said. “That’s compared to nearly $60 for a full tank of gas in my Jeep — so it’s cheaper to operate.”

The Georgia Department of Transportation is currently reviewing roadways to identify potential “charging deserts” and plans to expand access across rural and suburban areas.

The ‘Battery Belt of the South’

Governor Brian Kemp has called Georgia the ‘Battery Belt of the South’— as major EV manufacturers like SK Battery, Rivian, Kia, and Hyundai continue to expand operations in the state.

With production booming and infrastructure growing, policymakers hope that even without federal incentives, Georgia can remain a leader in America’s electric vehicle future.

September was a solid sales month as many consumers headed to dealer lots before EV tax credits expired on Sept. 30. Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales hit an all-time high in market share and accounted for 11.8% of all new vehicles sold. This market share was up nearly two percentage points from August 2025, which was also a strong month for BEV sales.

Year-to-date, BEV sales accounted for 8.4% of all new vehicles sold, an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared to the same period last year. And for third-quarter 2025, BEV sales increased 24.1% year over year. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicles, which were also eligible for the tax credits, didn’t perform nearly as well as BEVs. PHEV sales in September 2025 accounted for just 1.7% of all new vehicles sold, which is right in line with their year-to-date market share of 1.8%.

The average discount on a new vehicle increased slightly from August to September. According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per unit should totaled $3,116, up just $24 compared to August 2025. J.D. Power notes that more incentive spending was targeted at EVs. Expressed as a share of the average MSRP, overall incentive spending is expected to be 6.1%, while incentive spending for non-EVs should reach just 4.8%.

New light-vehicle inventory on the ground and in-transit totaled 2.65 million units at the end of September 2025, up by 6.2% compared to August 2025 but down 5.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect inventory levels to end the year slightly below their levels at the end of Q3.

New light-vehicle sales have been solid so far through the third quarter, with a year-to-date SAAR of 16.4 million units—an increase of 4.7% year over year. NADA stated it believes there has been some significant pull-ahead volume, as consumers rushed to dealer lots earlier in the year before tariffs took effect and in recent months as consumers purchased EVs before the end of tax credits.

The big question now: Will volume hold in the final quarter of the year and into next year as 2026 models arrive on dealer lots? NADA has already seen several OEMs release price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range for 2026 models, and NADA is watching closely to see how much—and when—OEMs will pass along tariff-related price increases.

My Thoughts on President Trump's Phase 1 Gaza Peace Deal

President Trump and Secretary Rubio announced a historic peace deal in the Middle East this week, and I am in full support. Hamas' unprovoked and brutal attack on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping over 250 innocent people, was pure evil. Now we must ensure the beginnings of this historic Gaza peace deal are fully upheld and all hostages are safely returned home to their families.

Israel, under Prime Minister Netanyahu, has shown tremendous resilience in dismantling Hamas's terror network. This deal offers a path forward, but only if Hamas honors its commitments. We remain vigilant and eager to see this agreement implemented completely.

President Trump and Secretary Rubio's continued leadership is essential to ensuring lasting peace and the safe return of all the innocent people still held captive.

Midland Airpark Mineral Rights

This week, I joined City of Midland Mayor Lori Blong for a press conference to discuss an ongoing mineral rights issue negatively impacting the city of Midland and its taxpayers and outline a plan to address it.

For background, Midland stands to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in mineral revenues from oil and gas production beneath Midland Airpark, and it's only right that those dollars benefit the taxpayers who live here. However, under the current law, these dollars are tied up in a maze of federal rules and red tape.

This is not a fair deal for the Permian Basin. Midland taxpayers should be the ones who benefit from what's beneath their feet, not the federal government. I remain committed to standing up for American energy, and this is another chapter in ensuring the hard work of the Permian Basin, and especially Midland, stays here.

FDA Quietly Approves Generic Abortion Drug

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of a new generic version of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone. Not only is this deeply concerning, but this new version was approved under the same weakened standards the previous administration applied to mifepristone, which removed critical safeguards designed to protect women’s health and safety.

Mifepristone has a well-documented record of serious medical complications, with countless women suffering severe health consequences or even losing their lives. Compounding these risks, some abusers and human traffickers have taken advantage of these lowered standards and mail-order access to obtain the pills without medical oversight or verification, in some cases giving them to women without their knowledge or consent.

Approving this generic version under these same reckless standards only expands these dangers and puts more women and their unborn children at risk. I remain committed to protecting life, defending women’s health and safety, and ensuring HHS Secretary Kennedy remains committed to restoring safeguards on these dangerous abortion drugs.

Congress is now considering overturning management plans in other states, too.","Congress has voted to overturn part of the federal management plans for millions of acres of BLM lands in eastern Montana.

The Bureau of Land Management’s Miles City Field Office manages almost 3 million acres of public lands. That’s just on the surface. The office is also responsible for more than 12 million acres below ground in mineral rights.

In 2024, the Miles City Field Office decided to stop selling new coal leases. The agency at that time cited declining demands for coal, and the goal of reducing planet-warming emissions

But Wednesday, the U.S. Senate concurred with a previous House vote to overturn that policy, as part of President Donald Trump’s push to revive fossil fuel power. Montana’s Republican Congressional delegation all voted in favor of the change. U.S. Sen. Steve Daines was critical of the field office’s 2024 decision.

""This means that the BLM prohibited all new coal leasing in the Powder River Basin. By the way, that is the home of the largest coal reserves in the United States,"" Daines said.

Active mines in the region with existing coal leases would not have been impacted.

Resource Management Plans guide how BLM lands are used and managed. They are drafted using feedback from all the people that use these lands. The development of the Miles City plan involved mineral owners, natural resource industry groups, landowners, ranchers, farmers, hunters and 17 tribal nations.

Jeanie Alderson was directly involved with developing the 2024 plan. She’s a sixth-generation rancher in southeastern Montana, and the BLM owns mineral rights under her land. Alderson says this change overrides local voices.

""To have all those years of all of us working on this – it's the best of our, sort of, democratic process, and with people who have to live with the results and the actions. But to have it done from Washington, D.C., just foisted on us, is really unfortunate.""

The BLM’s statement: “During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

The “Cancelled – Cancelled” notice on BLM’s NEPA website applies only to the environmental review stage. The entire project has not been canceled. The original story appears below. The headline has been updated.

LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A cluster of seven solar projects that would have produced enough electricity to power roughly 1.6 million average homes was canceled without explanation on Friday.

The Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, located west of Tonopah in sparsely populated Esmeralda County, now carries the note “Cancelled – Cancelled” next to its status on the Bureau of Land Management’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) register.

The collective output of Esmeralda Seven would have been 6.2 gigawatts of electric power. Three of the seven projects made a list of the five largest proposed solar farms in June 2024. That list of proposed projects was based on data from Global Energy Monitor, which tracks power projects of all kinds worldwide.

The seven individual projects: Gold Dust Solar, Smoky Valley Solar, Esmeralda Energy Center, Lone Mountain Solar, Nivloc Solar, Red Ridge 1 and Red Ridge 2.

The area is about 270 miles northwest of Las Vegas on U.S. 95.

As approval for renewable energy was fast-tracked under President Joe Biden, environmental reviews for the seven projects were combined and the cluster became known as Esmeralda Seven.

President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to end policies that favored solar and wind projects, making oil, gas and even coal his priorities for American energy development. BLM is one of the agencies under the Interior Department, led by Doug Burgum.

A post by the Nevada Republican Party on X Friday afternoon said: “Esmeralda County voters turned out for Trump, and now he has listened to them and cancelled the Esmeralda7 solar scam. Another phenomenal win by @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryBurgum“

8 News Now has reached out to BLM for comment.

Environmental groups including Friends of Nevada Wilderness, Conservation Lands Foundation, Center for Biological Diversity, the Coalition for Nevada’s Wildlife, the Walker River Paiute Tribe and the Yerington Paiute Tribe, and the Coalition for Nevada’s Wildlife had argued against the Esmeralda Seven project.

Another conservation group, Basin and Range Watch, sent a statement when the project’s status changed to canceled.

“The E7 projects would have destroyed significant archeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands. This news is a welcome relief and gives hope that the area could be protected for the long term in the future,” Kevin Emmerick, the group’s co-founder, said in an email.

Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, spoke to 8 News Now last year about serious concerns about the proposal. Among those concerns: nationally significant cultural resources and impacts and impacts on the state’s most genetically pure population of native desert bighorn sheep.

“There are over 400 Paleoindian sites in this area. They are 10-14,000 years old,” Netherton said.

Conservation groups generally support renewable energy over fossil fuels, but concerns often arise over conflicts at targeted locations.",https://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2025/07/solar-panels-e1752866077410.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-10 23:00:16.400418

In some cases, the award amounts given in the leaked document assume planned future federal funding, spending that had not yet been obligated.
Still, clean energy advocates warned that the administration’s latest moves would have widespread economic and environmental costs.
“So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness and clean energy, no matter which way you slice it,” Hoover said.
The DOE’s move to terminate funds that had already been obligated is also likely to face challenges from recipients and clean energy advocates.","Just days after announcing sweeping cuts to clean energy programs across the country, the Trump administration appears to be upping the ante—potentially clawing back billions more in federal funding.

The U.S. Department of Energy initially announced the termination of 321 financial awards on Oct. 2, which the agency said totaled $7.56 billion in taxpayer savings. An additional 327 awards appear on a new, leaked list of projects targeted by the DOE for termination, widely circulated this week among lobbyists, members of Congress and news outlets including Inside Climate News.

The cancellation of all these projects would gut the big federal push in clean energy made under the Biden administration, and experts warned of wide-ranging impacts to jobs, electricity grids stressed by rising demand and the environment. But the tides of economics—in particular the plummeting cost of wind and solar power—mean that renewable energy will likely continue to gain ground. Indeed, some recipients of the targeted projects have vowed to continue with their work, though scale and speed may suffer.

What’s more, an ICN analysis of federal spending data, based on a spreadsheet derived from the leaked document created by the Clean Air Task Force, indicates that the DOE’s estimate of taxpayer savings is overstated. The original 321 canceled awards include many that had already passed their stated end date—two dozen of them before Trump’s inauguration.

Considering only those awards that were still current at the time the government shutdown on Oct. 1, and subtracting funds already sent to the recipients, ICN calculated a potential cut of around $4.87 billion from the terminations announced on Oct. 2.

DOE did not respond to ICN’s questions on where its additional $2.7 billion in savings came from, and said that it could not verify the lists of targeted projects.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” said agency spokesperson Ben Dietderich. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

The cancellations announced on Oct. 2 largely targeted projects in blue states, prompting fierce criticism from Democrats and accusations that the administration was wielding the cuts as a political weapon amid the federal government shutdown.

“This is a shameless and vindictive attack by [Office of Management and Budget] Director Vought, which will eliminate jobs and raise energy costs for Americans across the country,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) in a statement.

But as the government shutdown stretched into its second week, news that the Trump administration was considering even more drastic cuts began to spread on Capitol Hill.

The leaked list of targeted awards contains all of those covered by the DOE’s initial announcement. Across the additional 327 awards, annotations in the document indicate total award amounts of $15.83 billion.

But again, the potential for immediate taxpayer savings if all these projects are abruptly terminated is markedly smaller.

After excluding grants past their end dates and subtracting money already sent to the recipients, ICN calculated potential cuts of $7.84 billion based on awards that had been obligated to receive funding.

In some cases, the award amounts given in the leaked document assume planned future federal funding, spending that had not yet been obligated. For instance, the document notes an amount of $1.2 billion to establish a series of hydrogen production facilities along the Gulf Coast of Texas.

However, only around $22 million in funding had been awarded so far for planning, analysis and design activities. Some $1.2 million of this has already been sent to HyVelocity, the consortium behind the effort.

This project is one of seven hydrogen hubs appropriated $8 billion through the 2026 fiscal year under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021.

Some of the projects covered by the Oct. 2 announcement and among the additional list of targeted projects in the leaked document had already been terminated in May. They include a grant of more than $86 million to Sublime Systems of Somerville, Massachusetts, to create a low-carbon cement factory and a project to replace the use of natural gas with hydrogen at an ExxonMobil plant in Texas that had been awarded more than $330 million, most of which had not yet been sent.

Still, clean energy advocates warned that the administration’s latest moves would have widespread economic and environmental costs.

“There will be job losses in local communities. There will be less reliable electricity grids,” said Zealan Hoover, former senior advisor to the EPA administrator during the Biden administration.

“Federal dollars are designed to solve investment gaps where private capital does not flow,” Hoover said. “So my expectation is that if these grants are terminated, then that work will either not progress, it will progress significantly slower or other sources of public investment at the state and local level or social investment will need to be redirected—but then that comes at the cost of investment that’s not happening elsewhere.”

Because many of the grants aim to catalyze new technologies, cutting them also harms the country’s ability to keep pace with China and other nations, he added.

“So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness and clean energy, no matter which way you slice it,” Hoover said.

Conrad Schneider, U.S. senior director for the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit that promotes climate solutions and reducing air pollution, said he was most concerned about cuts to projects intended to develop new technologies and demonstrate their commercial viability. “With respect to some of these emerging technologies that require the demonstrations, that’s what we would say would be the hammer blow,” he said.

These projects include initial work for the hydrogen hubs championed by the Biden administration as “critical energy infrastructure” that would create jobs and spur investment in technology to power hard-to-decarbonize sectors like heavy industry and long-haul trucking. Two of those hubs, MACH2 and ARCH2, would be located in part in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania.

The hubs have bipartisan support in the state. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro hailed them as a “win for the Commonwealth,” while Republican state Sen. Gene Yaw announced he was “delighted” by the investment when it was first announced and looked forward to “working cooperatively” with the federal government and businesses to realize the projects’ full potential. Just last week, MACH2’s chief operating officer, Manny Citron, told WHYY that Republican Sen. Dave McCormick’s staff had been “incredibly supportive” of the hub.

Andrew Cottone, founder of one of MACH2’s anchor partners, Aternium, said he had not been notified of any changes in the funding status of the hub. Either way, Aternium will move forward with its plans for building hydrogen production facilities in the mid-Atlantic region, he said.

“It’s full steam ahead for us,” he said. “We would love a strong ecosystem, but we’ve launched this company with a responsible business model. We are viable with or without tax credits. We are viable with or without the Department of Energy hub system.”

Others involved in the leadership of the MACH2 and ARCH2 hubs did not respond to requests for comment. It is unclear whether the projects can survive without federal government support.

Part of the problem is that potential agreements with steel and iron companies to use the fuel produced by the hubs did not end up moving forward, said Hilary Lewis, steel director at the nonprofit Industrious Labs, which works to decarbonize industry. The steel and iron industries contribute about 11 percent of global carbon emissions.

“We would have liked to see companies like U.S. Steel really invested in the hydrogen hub process,” she said.

The federal government has long played a key role in technological advances. Lewis said Biden-era tax credits, the hydrogen hubs and other federal investments in making green steel were all “great examples” of supporting clean energy solutions for industry.

“But when the government backtracks on its promises and cancels this type of funding, it puts American competitiveness at risk,” she said. “We are ceding leadership to other countries that are going to make these investments.”

Inside Climate News obtained a copy of the termination letter sent by the DOE to one of the grant recipients targeted in its initial announcement.

In the letter, dated Oct. 1, the agency said the recipient’s award was reviewed in a Portfolio Review Process (PRP) to ensure that the funding was “financially sound and economically viable, aligned with national and economic security interests, and consistent with Federal law and this Administration’s policies and priorities and program goals and priorities.”

“DOE regrets to inform you that the subject [grant] did not pass Standards of the PRP Committee review and will not proceed,” the letter reads.

Not all of the recipients have received notice that funding is being cut off. A spokesperson for the California Energy Commission on Thursday said that it still hadn’t received any communication from DOE that a $630 million grant for improvements to the state’s electric grid had been canceled, despite appearing in the Oct. 2 list of terminated awards.

Other recipients, including Mercedes-Benz—awarded some $285 million for next generation all-electric van production—and the University of North Dakota, which had four awards in the leaked list of wider potential cuts, declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Neither Mercedes-Benz nor UND’s awards were included in the DOE’s initial terminations.

“The Trump administration and its allies are actively restricting the supply of affordable clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes.”

To some groups impacted by the DOE’s moves, the decision to terminate funding capped off a long period of uncertainty stretching to President Donald Trump’s first day back in office.

“[For] a lot of members of our team, there was a certain amount of relief when this finally happened, because the fact that this has been going on since January has been a challenge,” said Zora Chung, cofounder of ReJoule.

Chung’s company had been slated to receive $10 million in federal funding to support its efforts to repurpose electric vehicle batteries for energy storage in commercial buildings. The project also sought to advance opportunities for historically underrepresented workers and businesses, and contribute to widespread adoption of long-duration energy storage in the U.S. by 2030, according to the award description.

To Chung, the DOE’s decision to terminate ReJoule’s award doesn’t reflect the project’s potential to advance the agency’s core mission. “We still believe that the project is aligned with the DOE goals of energy independence and resilience, as well as competing directly with China on battery technology,” Chung said.

Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, agreed.

“Canceling projects that would lower electric bills and make the grid more reliable is not about achieving ‘energy dominance,’” Slaney said, referring to one of Trump’s key priorities. “The Trump administration and its allies are actively restricting the supply of affordable clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes.”

Despite the loss of federal funding, Chung said that ReJoule’s battery project would move forward—slowed and scaled back, but undeterred.

“While the cancellation is certainly a setback for this specific deployment timeline—and a missed opportunity for accelerating American job creation and domestic energy security—it does not change our mission,” Chung said in a LinkedIn post confirming the award’s cancellation.

The DOE’s move to terminate funds that had already been obligated is also likely to face challenges from recipients and clean energy advocates. Chung, in her LinkedIn post, said that ReJoule would be formally reviewing its options, including appeal—while the California Energy Commission said that it “will evaluate options to appeal or reverse federal actions to cut previously allocated funds to these important programs.”

In its Oct. 2 announcement, the DOE claimed that the terminated projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But the administration’s moves come as solar and wind power, in particular, are establishing themselves as the most economically competitive options for energy investment. On Tuesday, a report from the energy think tank Ember announced that renewables had for the first time surpassed coal in the global electricity mix. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s effort to lease rights to extract 167 million tons of coal on federal lands in Montana attracted just one bid, of $186,000.

According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy capacity is poised to more than double globally in the next five years, even as projections for the United States are revised down based on the Trump administration’s policies. Renewables are growing in countries like China, India, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; Germany recently announced a $7 billion investment in industrial decarbonization.

Michael Noble, a Minnesota-based consultant to clean energy companies and a longtime advocate for the energy transition, said that wind, solar, batteries and related technologies are “all kick-ass technologies that are falling in price. Those fundamentals cannot be undone by politicians.”

The administration’s favoring of fossil fuels “is putting all of our money on a horse that’s already lost,” said Sachu Constantine, executive director of Vote Solar, a nonprofit based in San Francisco.

The momentum is unlikely to last. - Marketplace",Henry Epp,,,,,https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/10/10/evs-drive-strong-auto-sales-in-the-third-quarter-of-2025,"The U.S. automotive industry just had a strong quarter.
More than four million new vehicles were sold in July, August and September, according to estimates from Cox Automotive and Edmunds.
But that sales pace might be difficult to maintain as the industry faces growing headwinds from changing federal policies on electric vehicles and international trade.
The third quarter coincided with the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, causing a surge in EV sales that’s likely to be temporary.
But now that the credit’s gone, “we're absolutely going to see a massive drop in electric vehicle sales for the next few months,” predicted Brauer.","The U.S. automotive industry just had a strong quarter.

More than four million new vehicles were sold in July, August and September, according to estimates from Cox Automotive and Edmunds. That’s well above the same period last year, and puts the industry on track to sell over 16 million new vehicles this year, per Cox.

But that sales pace might be difficult to maintain as the industry faces growing headwinds from changing federal policies on electric vehicles and international trade. The third quarter coincided with the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, causing a surge in EV sales that’s likely to be temporary.

That surge was apparent at Audi Oakland, where Daniel Kossut is general manager.

“We started August with over 75 EV units in stock, and we wrapped up September with only three left in stock,” Kossut said.

Kossut said his dealership marketed the end of the tax credit pretty heavily. But he also saw a lot of buyers who already knew they had a hard deadline to get that discount.

“They know what they're looking for. They're pretty savvy, and people knew this was it,” he said.

This EV sales rush ahead of the tax credit expiration is a classic example of a pull forward effect, said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at automotive information site iSeeCars.com.

“Anyone who was on the fence or seriously considering an electric vehicle purchase in the next three, six, nine months ran out and did it before the end of September,” he said.

So, those sales that might have otherwise occurred next January or April, happened in September instead. That pull forward made for the strongest quarterly EV sales in the U.S. on record: over 438,000 according to Cox Automotive.

But now that the credit’s gone, “we're absolutely going to see a massive drop in electric vehicle sales for the next few months,” predicted Brauer.

That drop could have an impact on overall car sales in the months ahead. Because, if you look beyond EVs, sales in the third quarter, especially September, were on the soft side, Brauer said.

“An increasing number of people can't afford new cars, or they're taking out loans they probably shouldn't be taking out,” he said.

Eighty-four-month loans (that’s seven years) are getting more popular. The average monthly payment on a new vehicle is nearly $750.

Pair those figures with low consumer sentiment, and it’s not hard to see why Brauer and other analysts don’t expect a huge rush to dealerships around the holidays this year.

At the same time, automakers are facing rising costs of their own from the Trump administration’s tariffs, which are steadily eating into their profits, according to Tyson Jominy, senior vice president of data and analytics at JD Power.

“We estimate it's about $40 billion of tariff costs that automakers are absorbing, and that is equivalent to nearly 40% of global profits in the auto industry last year,” Jominy said.

So far, carmakers are mostly choosing not to pass those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Jominy said that’s partly because they’re in a competitive industry. Every automotive company has a different supply chain, and therefore a different level of exposure to tariffs.

“Just because you have that cost as an automaker for producing overseas doesn't mean your competitors do,” Jominy said. “That is leading to very competitive price dynamics here in the U.S.”

However, car companies probably can’t eat those costs forever, assuming the import taxes stay in place.

“We would suspect that once we get into the new calendar year, 2026, you'll see some increases in those stickers of the vehicles that are being delivered to dealer lots in time for the spring,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

And the most affordable vehicles on the market, those under $30,000, are the most exposed to tariffs, Smoke said. That’s because they’re more likely to be assembled or include more parts from outside the U.S.

But hiking the cost of those cars, SUVs, and crossovers, “clearly challenges things for the consumer who's already stretching just to be able to afford a vehicle in that price point,” Smoke said.

The auto industry does have one bright spot to look forward to in the new year: Tax refunds. After the GOP tax bill passed over the summer, tax refunds for many Americans could be substantial, Smoke said.

“It's amazing what cash-in-pocket does to vehicle demand and activity.”

But until tax season, it could be a long winter at car dealerships.",https://img.apmcdn.org/e9d2ad83a0866c106ba74c482f924fad71b57d16/widescreen/06a365-20251010-cars-lined-up-in-a-dealership-parking-lot-2000.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 19:01:56.092424

That was the takeaway from a keynote presentation by Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois and Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May at the Tulane Business Forum on Friday. The LED chief argued that a series of major investments portend a new era of economic swagger for the state.

Before a crowd of about 500 at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, Bourgeois pointed to the last 21 months of outside investment in Louisiana, led by the $10 billion Meta data center in north Louisiana and the nearly $6 billion Hyundai steel plant near Baton Rouge, and said it’s time for Louisianans to believe in the state’s prospects again.

“We've been working hard to change the narrative,” Bourgeois said. “There’s been this feeling that we’re not good enough. We want to change that.”

Bourgeois said 58 announced projects could lead to 70,000 new jobs and lend credibility to the state in the eyes of future investors.

Other big investments announced or expanded since Bourgeois took on the role of the state's biggest business booster in 2024 include LNG projects from Woodside Energy and Venture Global, plus the CF Industries “blue ammonia” plant in Ascension Parish. This week, Louisiana-based electrical contractor MMR announced a $55 million expansion of its manufacturing capabilities in Lafayette Parish.

“We’re leveraging the state’s existing strengths in energy with new twists,” Bourgeois said.

Bourgeois said the Meta data center is creating opportunities for existing businesses, like Monroe-based wholesaler Robertson Produce, which just landed a large contract to help feed hundreds of construction workers.

Experts talk coffee, AI and music business

The comments from Bourgeois and May were part of a half-day business forum organized by the Tulane Association of Business Alumni that's been an annual tradition for most of the last half century.

Panels jumped from subject to subject as the lawyers, engineers and accountants in attendance earned continuing education credits in between networking opportunities and a lunch.

Earlier in the day, three coffee industry insiders talked about how the Trump Administration's tariffs are making it more difficult and expensive but businesses are adapting.

Ryan McKinnon of Westfeldt Brothers, the New Orleans-based coffee importer, said that one side effect of the import taxes is buyers are sourcing coffee beans from countries with lower tariffs — like Mexico and Honduras — and moving away from places like Brazil, which has a higher tax.

""There will be some differences in taste profile, but you can get some that are very close,"" McKinnon said.

Tulane University President Michael Fitts used a portion of his time to promote his school's vision to expand its downtown campus, centered around the hoped-for redevelopment of the former Charity Hospital building, which has moldered since Hurricane Katrina.

Fitts envisions a thriving downtown neighborhood, propelled by Tulane biomedical research and the companies it spawns, as the catalyst for a revival of New Orleans' struggling economy.

The Esmeralda 7 project, composed of seven connected solar farms proposed by NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power, and Invenergy, was designed to sit across around 185 square miles of public land, an area nearly the size of Las Vegas. The plan promised to deliver about 5,350 MW of electricity, enough to power nearly 2 million homes – that’s three times the Hoover Dam’s generating capacity.

The Biden administration had permitted the developers’ joint proposals, and the Trump administration had advanced the project’s draft environmental impact statement. However, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) hadn’t issued a final environmental impact statement or record of decision.

Yesterday, the BLM’s website marked the project as canceled. That’s part of a broader shift within the Trump administration away from utility-scale renewable energy development on federal land — even as global clean energy buildout accelerates.

According to Politico, “The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had ‘agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.'”

The BLM had spent years reviewing Esmeralda 7’s potential impacts on wildlife and public lands, so clean energy advocates say the decision to scrap the project is more political than procedural. “The Trump administration’s reported cancellation of Nevada’s largest solar and storage project will restrict America’s ability to produce homegrown clean energy,” the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said in a statement. “This action hurts America’s economy, its energy security, and the jobs of thousands of hardworking Americans.”

Electrek’s Take

Anyone shocked by this move hasn’t been paying attention, but that doesn’t make it any less destructive. Killing the Esmeralda 7 project isn’t just a setback for Nevada — it’s a blow to US energy independence, and making the developers jump through the same hoops all over again is a stall tactic. Utility-scale solar, like Esmeralda 7, is the backbone of the transition away from fossil fuels and toward true domestic energy dominance.

The US still spends billions each year importing oil, even as solar power remains the cheapest source of new electricity in history. Every canceled project like this one delays when the US can power itself with affordable clean energy, which means higher prices, higher emissions, and fewer jobs in the long run. And don’t expect this one to be a one-off cancellation of renewables on federal lands, seeing how Trump is encouraging the buildout of fossil fuel projects on those same lands.

During drinking water treatment, the presence of bromide can create carcinogenic byproducts that utilities need expensive treatment equipment to avoid.
EPA will also give more loopholes to coal plants, including giving retiring coal plants more time to operate without adequate pollution controls.
The Trump administration is now giving the green light for power plants to keep dumping toxic chemicals into drinking water supplies.","Coal-fired power plants discharge wastewater containing toxic chemicals and heavy metals directly into waterways that serve as sources of drinking water for more than 30 million Americans. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized improved wastewater treatment standards for coal-fired power plants. But now, Trump’s EPA is trying to gut these safeguards at the behest of the coal power industry. As part of a recent Trump administration announcement to bail out the failing coal industry, the EPA proposed to delay the compliance deadlines for five years and may use that time to gut the standards altogether.

Power plants have historically been by far one of the largest sources of toxic pollutants in America’s rivers, lakes, and streams. Last year the EPA updated safeguards to require coal power plants to upgrade their technology to meet zero-discharge requirements for their three largest waste streams: wastewater generated by power plant air pollution scrubbers, water used to flush out coal ash that accumulates at the bottom of the coal boiler (known as bottom ash), and leachate from coal ash surface impoundments and landfills. EPA had updated the standards, known as Effluent Limitation Guidelines or ELGs, to require substantial reductions in the amount of arsenic, mercury, and other pollutants that power plants are permitted to dump into U.S. waterways.

Affordable technologies are available to completely eliminate toxic pollution from coal plants’ wastewater — there is no excuse for not requiring coal plants to begin using this technology. The standards will significantly reduce toxic metals and other harmful pollutants such as bromide that are difficult and costly to remove from our drinking water. During drinking water treatment, the presence of bromide can create carcinogenic byproducts that utilities need expensive treatment equipment to avoid. Some drinking water utilities have been forced to install expensive new treatment systems to remove toxic contaminants from upstream coal-fired power plants. Municipal drinking water utilities across the country have pressed EPA to ensure strong guidelines to control discharges of toxic chemicals from coal-fired power plants.

The benefits of requiring power plants to meet the new wastewater zero-discharge standards were estimated to be at least three to six times greater than the costs to industry, including reduced incidences of cancer and cardiovascular disease, reduced lead exposures in children, and reduced drinking water treatment costs.

Under the safeguards that EPA adopted in 2024, power plants are required to notify EPA by the end of the year if they intend to retire rather than meet the new zero-discharge requirements, and to meet the requirements by the end of 2029. EPA’s new proposed rule would postpone those deadlines for five years until the end of 2031 and the end of 2034. EPA will also give more loopholes to coal plants, including giving retiring coal plants more time to operate without adequate pollution controls.

The Trump Administration is trying to bail out the coal industry with direct subsidies and by gutting basic pollution controls, but the fact is that these plants are aging, costly, and polluting and cannot compete with clean energy, which is cheaper and more reliable. Coal now generates just 15% of American electricity because it’s the most polluting, dangerous, and expensive way to produce power. When they prop up corporate polluters, we all pay the price through higher electricity bills and toxic pollution.

Even though the Clean Water Act requires polluters to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available to treat wastewater, prior to 2015 most coal plants had no limits on toxic pollutants in their wastewater discharges. In response to an Earthjustice suit filed in 2010, EPA revised the wastewater standards for the first time in decades. Coal-fired power plants were required to install state-of-the-art wastewater treatment technology and monitor local water quality. But then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler finalized a weaker rule in 2020. Earthjustice filed a lawsuit challenging that weakening of the rules, which resulted in new standards finalized in 2023. For the first time, those standards included new treatment standards for leachate from power plant coal ash disposal sites, a result of a court victory won by Earthjustice and partner groups in 2019, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down a prior attempt by EPA to exempt these waste streams from more stringent discharge limits.

The EPA plans to hold a public hearing on October 14, you can participate. The Trump administration is now giving the green light for power plants to keep dumping toxic chemicals into drinking water supplies. But we will see them in court.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:03:35.521433

The IRA’s tax credit for clean hydrogen production, known as 45V, was meant to help spur supply of the fuel.
The hydrogen hubs, meanwhile, were meant to coordinate producers and offtakers to create regional ecosystems that could someday be interconnected with pipelines and other infrastructure.
California’s regional hub, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES, plans to continue without the financing and could turn to state funds to make up the difference.
The state Clean Truck and Bus Vouchers program, known as HVIP, and the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Program Investment Plans could bolster offtakers.","In July, China launched the world’s largest green hydrogen plant. One month later, India’s government backed 19 projects designed to make the country a leader in producing green hydrogen, which could help decarbonize everything from steel to shipping. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are pumping billions of dollars into infrastructure to produce and export the fuel over the next few years.

The United States, meanwhile, is yanking funding for some of its most ambitious clean-hydrogen projects.

Last week, as part of a list of 321 grants revoked in the name of saving $7.5 billion in spending, the Department of Energy rescinded $2.2 billion in awards to two of the seven hydrogen regional hubs established under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Unlike the five other hubs, the law designed the terminated projects, in California and the Pacific Northwest, to focus exclusively on hydrogen made with renewable electricity, making them an easy target as the Trump administration slashes Biden-era clean energy projects.

Now this week a second Energy Department list shared with Canary Media indicates the agency is considering whether to pull funding from all seven hydrogen hubs, including those in Texas, Appalachia, and the mid-Atlantic and two in the Midwest.

It’s not certain whether the entire $24 billion worth of awards on the new list will be eliminated. Companies whose projects appeared only on the second list, including utilities and carbon removal firms, have yet to receive notice of cancellation. While federal officials gave companies involved in the West Coast hubs a warning before announcing the cuts last week, three separate producers involved in the other five hubs had not heard from the administration as of Thursday, according to California Hydrogen Business Council CEO Katrina Fritz, who checked in with the sources.

But already, the potential cuts are sowing doubt within the emerging sector — and in the clean energy space more broadly.

“Any amount of uncertainty in funding is really detrimental to private-sector investment, and that’s just not a good way to spur innovation domestically and compete on a global stage,” said Rachel Starr, the senior U.S. policy manager for the hydrogen program at the Clean Air Task Force. ​“Plenty of other countries are investing in this. We’re going to lose our competitive edge if we stop.”

“Yeah, I’m worried”

It remains unclear whether the document outlining a fuller list of cuts, which a lobbyist told E&E News was weeks old, represents an expansion of the previous cuts or a maximalist proposal from which the earlier terminations were whittled down.

In a statement, the Energy Department said it was ​“unable to verify” the list but that the agency ​“continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

A former Energy Department official with direct knowledge confirmed that the list is legitimate and said that it represents the grants DOE officials have recommended for cancellation to the White House. The official suggested that the agency is obfuscating its plans to pull the grants to regional hubs in red states until after a federal budget is passed, an effort to prevent congressional Republicans from adding an amendment that preserves the funding into the budget.

“They can’t do that in the middle of a government shutdown,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Canary Media. ​“I do expect them to cancel these funds … [but] not until there’s a full-year appropriations [bill].”

Already, key Republican lawmakers have expressed concern.

“Yeah, I’m worried,” Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito told E&E News when asked about the possibility of losing funding for West Virginia’s hydrogen hub. ​“It’s a big deal for us.”

The uncertainty only adds to the challenges facing the hydrogen industry.

The Biden administration created a two-pronged hydrogen strategy via the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA’s tax credit for clean hydrogen production, known as 45V, was meant to help spur supply of the fuel. The policy survived the rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July, but Republicans shortened the timeline for the write-offs from 10 years to two.

The hydrogen hubs, meanwhile, were meant to coordinate producers and offtakers to create regional ecosystems that could someday be interconnected with pipelines and other infrastructure. Even before the cuts, however, the hubs were struggling to generate enough demand.

“Low demand explains why the West Coast hydrogen ambitions have never amounted to much,” Martin Tengler, the analyst who heads the hydrogen research team at the consultancy BloombergNEF, wrote in a memo to investors Monday. ​“Low demand stems from a lack of incentives such as the quotas or carbon prices that are present in Europe, combined with a focus on sectors where hydrogen use is highly uneconomical.”

As a result, he argued, the decision to slash funding for those two hubs ​“has little direct impact on the pipeline of projects BloombergNEF has expected to come online by 2030.”

Of the six commercial green hydrogen projects larger than 1 megawatt that the consultancy tracked in its latest outlook report, four have reached a final investment decision and just one is operational. ​“All five are very small,” the investor note stated.

In an email to Canary Media, Tengler said the impact of eliminating funding for all the hubs ​“would be negative, but the most important things are the tax credits.”

Back to the States

The hubs won’t necessarily fall apart without the federal grants.

California’s regional hub, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES, plans to continue without the financing and could turn to state funds to make up the difference. The Golden State’s newly overhauled cap-and-invest program is one potential source. The state Clean Truck and Bus Vouchers program, known as HVIP, and the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Program Investment Plans could bolster offtakers.

“California has been a hydrogen hub for many years, and it’s getting bigger and bigger,” Fritz said. ​“It’s already in application. There are people riding on hydrogen fuel-cell buses every day in California.”

Roxana Bekemohammadi, executive director of the U.S. Hydrogen Alliance, said it’s possible that Congress could extend the 45V tax credit before it expires at the end of 2027. But in the meantime, she said, ​“state-level hydrogen incentives are the most stable path forward.”

“The cuts to these hubs seem shortsighted and ultimately will result in the loss of jobs in our country,” said Carrie Schoeneberger, an industrial analyst who covers hydrogen for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ​“This will put the U.S. a step back and threaten U.S. leadership, which is against the stated aims of the current administration for American energy dominance.

AUSTIN, TX, UNITED STATES, October 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As American homeowners face an unprecedented surge in energy costs, with electricity prices rising 6.5% nationally and utilities requesting $29 billion in rate increases for 2025, Metal America is helping families build energy-efficient barndominiums that significantly reduce heating and cooling costs through advanced insulation systems and innovative steel construction methods.

Industry experts describe the current situation as an ""unprecedented utility affordability crisis,"" with high temperatures putting additional strain on the electric grid and driving electricity system costs higher. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports residential electricity prices increased 6.5% year-over-year as of May 2025, reaching an average of 17.47 cents per kilowatt-hour nationally—the fastest price growth since the beginning of the century.

""The dramatic rise in utility costs makes energy efficiency more critical than ever for families building their dream homes,"" said Colin Knutson, founder of Metal America. ""Our comprehensive insulation approach, combined with precision steel construction, creates homes that stay comfortable year-round while protecting homeowners from these escalating energy bills for decades to come.""

RECORD UTILITY INCREASES DRIVE DEMAND FOR EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION

The impact on households has been severe. Winter heating costs have risen 10% compared to the previous winter, according to EIA's revised February 2025 forecast. The average summer electric bill reached $719 for June-September 2024, representing an 8% year-over-year increase and the highest summer costs in a decade.

Consumer advocacy experts report that more than one-third of households have reduced or skipped paying basic expenses like medicine or food to pay energy bills in the past year. Energy assistance directors warn that families are increasingly afraid to turn on air conditioning because of bill concerns.

COMPREHENSIVE INSULATION STRATEGY ADDRESSES ENERGY CHALLENGES

Metal America's energy efficiency advantage begins with their standard double-bubble insulation included on every build, which acts as both a thermal barrier and moisture control system. The company's comprehensive approach incorporates multiple insulation strategies that often exceed local building code requirements.

The recommended insulation strategy utilizes a proven closed-cell and open-cell foam combination. The process begins with 1-2 inches of closed-cell foam applied directly to metal panels, providing R-6 to R-7 per inch while creating a complete vapor barrier that prevents condensation issues. This is followed by 3-5 inches of open-cell foam providing additional R-value at approximately R-3.5 per inch.

Traditional construction often struggles with thermal bridging and air leakage that can reduce actual energy performance by 20-30%. Metal America's systematic approach creates homes that perform closer to their designed efficiency ratings in real-world conditions.

STEEL CONSTRUCTION ADVANTAGES FOR ENERGY PERFORMANCE

Metal America's 12-gauge steel framing with 4-foot on-center spacing provides unique advantages for energy efficiency beyond structural strength. The steel framework allows for consistent insulation installation without thermal bridging issues common with traditional wood framing, while precision manufacturing ensures better air sealing than site-built construction.

The 26-gauge metal paneling, when properly insulated, creates an extremely durable thermal envelope that maintains performance characteristics for decades without settling, shifting, or degrading like traditional insulation materials.

Understanding that energy efficiency requirements vary significantly across the United States, Metal America works with local building codes and climate zones to optimize insulation strategies for each region. The company's flash-and-batt alternative system combines closed-cell foam with high-performance fiberglass batts for cost-effective code compliance while maintaining excellent moisture control.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS AMID RISING UTILITY COSTS

With utility industry experts warning that bills will continue rising, the durability of steel construction and properly installed insulation systems means energy performance remains consistent over the building's life, unlike traditional construction methods, where efficiency can degrade over time.

""We've taken the durability and cost advantages of metal construction and solved the energy efficiency equation through proper engineering and insulation design,"" said Knutson. ""The result is homes that outperform traditional construction in both comfort and efficiency, providing families with protection against these unprecedented utility cost increases.""

TURNKEY SOLUTION FOR ENERGY-CONSCIOUS BUILDERS

Metal America's complete turnkey service includes working with customers to select the optimal insulation strategy for their climate zone, budget, and performance goals. The company's 9-12 month construction timeline ensures proper installation and quality control throughout the insulation process.

The company's partnership with experienced general contractors ensures that insulation installation meets manufacturer specifications and building codes, while their comprehensive approach addresses all aspects of the thermal envelope from foundation to roof.

States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years.
The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.
Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid.
There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects.","A George Mason University report released Friday looks at how Virginia can meet its mandatory goal of decarbonizing the state’s utility providers while also getting more localities on board for certain energy projects. It comes as Virginia faces critical energy demands as ratepayers and lawmakers consider how to meet those needs and make utility bills more affordable.

The report projects that Virginia will see an 8%increase in energy demand by 2030 and a 20% increase by 2035, driven largely by the growth of data centers and manufacturing. In 2023, the commonwealth was the top energy importer from other states. Nuclear power is providing the heaviest lift of energy production in the state, with natural gas and solar increasing the most in bringing power online.

Adjunct Professor Paul Bubbosh of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason said the report is meant to be practical in light of the state’s energy needs. He said with challenges like the loss of federal incentives for renewable energy projects and supply chain holdups, the state will have to rely on natural gas in part during the interim.

“The complicating factor is that solar and wind are on a levelized cost of energy basis cheaper than natural gas and coal and nuclear power,” Bubbosh said. “However, with the added cost of supply chain issues, it further complicates the picture.”

Natural gas is also facing supply chain challenges for proposed gas plants and with fossil fuels continuing to be a scarce commodity, it will add to the steadily increasing fuel costs, Bubbosh said.

Bubbosh encourages utilities to ramp up their efficiency efforts and consider data center advancement that will allow them to pull less power off of the grid. Under the VCEA, Appalachian Power was expected to make a 2% reduction in energy consumption by 2025, while Dominion was told to reduce by 5%. Dominion has not met those goals and additional reductions will be determined by the State Corporation Commission every three years.

“Virginia has not met its targets in energy efficiency, so it needs to do a lot more in terms of getting consumers to reduce consumption during peak periods,” Bubbosh said.

States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years. Many projects are often thrown into the queue before financing or other permits are secured; some data centers may not actually materialize. The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.

“One of the key difficulties with a lot of these large load centers is the financing. So they now need to demonstrate that they have the financing in place and that they’re ready to go and that should improve things,” Bubbosh said.

The regional grid operator PJM has taken heat from most of the governors in the coverage area for slow walking the approval of connection permits, largely for solar and wind projects. Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid.

PJM has pointed to supply chain issues slowing down certain projects already in the queue and delaying their actions. They have also made some reforms to ramp up their permitting process.

But Bubbosh said the real focus should be put on rural Virginia communities, to educate them on renewable energy projects, their own energy needs, and how they can meet their own demand while respecting the local culture.

“The pathway to energy security in Virginia runs through rural Virginia. It’s imperative that the Commonwealth’s government understands that to achieve lasting results, we need to bring those in Virginia, whom we’re asking so much of, such as their land, to be part of the conversation,” Bubbosh said.

There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects. Currently, it is up to local boards of supervisors to vote if a solar, wind, gas, or nuclear project can move forward and what the related ordinances will entail. In some counties, the boards have approved a power-hungry data center project application and denied a solar farm proposal the same night.

The GMU report urges local grassroots movements to aid in creating community energy-need assessments to help rural communities understand which projects need to be built out to keep their own lights on, rather than sending power up north to Data Center Alley.

“The problem with Virginia is legislators are trying to ram through siting requirements at the state level. That will backfire, and you will get greater resistance to large scale solar deployment,” Bubbosh said. “So what we’re trying to do is to say, if you really want to achieve lasting results and energy security, you’ve got to bring on rural Virginians.”

The report suggests expanding solar projects in Northern Virginia where the power need is the greatest. Then the energy will be right at the source of the need. Once the northern parts of the state’s infrastructure has been sufficiently expanded, it would be easier to ask other communities to build out their energy infrastructure.

“Then I believe it would be appropriate for Virginia legislators to turn around and say, ‘Look, we all want to keep the lights on. We have exhausted the full potential in Northern Virginia and now we want to turn our attention to, let’s say, the Southside, or Tidewater’,” Bubbosh said.

Their goal with the report and recommendations is to aid state and local governments in moving forward with solid plans on how to meet the growing energy demands, no matter which party is dominant in the legislature or who occupies the Governor’s Mansion. That will help move the needle on siting issues, researchers hope.

“One administration is gonna come in and they’re gonna want to favor these technologies, A, B, and C. Four years later, another one’s gonna come in, and you’re gonna go back and forth,” Bubbosh said.

Bills spelling out how the state may aid communities in their energy plans are expected to be filed in the next regular legislative session, beginning in January.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_121846-1-1024x7681760120726.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=tK6hqFPG,N,,2025-10-10 16:03:29.309418

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada.
That includes final EISs for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.
The Solar Energy Industries Association did not respond to requests for comment.
Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.","“The administration wants to stop these projects, period, so there is no chance for approval,” he said.

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, agreed. “As the Trump administration continues to take actions hostile to renewable energy projects, that may not be the last solar project on federal land to cancel,” he said.

The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 project to note that the environmental review of the project was “cancelled.”

The decision to cancel the programmatic environmental impact statement was described by a federal government official with knowledge of the situation, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly, as a mutual decision by BLM and the handful of companies that had proposed the seven individual solar power projects that would have comprised Esmeralda 7.

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

Representatives with the energy companies involved in developing the seven individual solar power plants that collectively comprised the Esmeralda 7 project did not respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration has made its skepticism of the solar build-out in Nevada clear in recent months, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and other officials saying solar is an “intermittent” technology that doesn’t provide reliable energy. But some conservationists alarmed by the proposed rollout of large solar projects in Nevada and other Western states celebrated the demise of Esmeralda 7, saying as designed it took up up far too much land.

“Friends of Nevada Wilderness is thrilled that this poorly sited project is dead,” said Shaaron Netherton, the group’s executive director.

“In the push to get this particular project through, the BLM ignored the importance of this region’s cultural significance, biological significance and the fact that it is one of the most intact landscapes remaining in Nevada,” Netherton added.

BLM in July 2024 issued a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project and had originally planned to issue a final review document in April.

At least 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under at least preliminary review by BLM when President Donald Trump took office still await action.

That includes final EISs for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.

What’s more, two major solar projects that were issued records of decision in the final weeks of the Biden administration have since sat in limbo — the Jove Solar Project in southwest Arizona and the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project in southern Nevada, with a combined capacity to power 350,000 homes.

Burgum and his department have increasingly tightened the restrictions on solar and wind projects. Burgum signed a secretarial order that directed the agency, among other things, to eliminate policies granting “preferential treatment” for wind and solar development on federal lands and waters. The department also issued guidance to agency leaders that Burgum and Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor would need to review a long list of procedural decisions for those projects.

Burgum in August also signed an order that requires Interior to consider “capacity density” when evaluating solar and wind projects, which could hinder them because they tend to take up more land than other kinds of energy development.

The Solar Energy Industries Association did not respond to requests for comment.

But Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s president and CEO, sent a letter to Burgum in August asking to meet with him to discuss his agency’s moves to restrict permit approvals for renewable energy.

Interior informally declined the meeting request, according to an industry official granted anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Concerns about project’s size

The Esmeralda 7 project was ambitious by most any measure.

It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands. If built as imagined, it could have produced about 5,350 MW of electricity — enough to power nearly 2 million homes.

Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.

On the surface, at least, the project appeared to be proposed in an ideal spot in Esmeralda County.

The federal government controls 98 percent of the county’s 2.2 million acres, and BLM accounts for the vast majority of that — managing 2.1 million acres there.

There’s not a single incorporated town, and only about 729 residents, ranking it among the 20 least populated counties in the nation, with the nation’s second-lowest population density of residents per square mile.

But the project had garnered concerns about its sheer size and the potential for it to disturb migratory patterns for wildlife.

Conservation advocates, local government leaders and nearby residents have expressed concerns about the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed Esmeralda 7 project, which in addition to covering a huge swath of desert lands would have also included miles of roads and associated transmission lines.

They have argued for placing onshore utility-scale projects on previously disturbed sites and expanding the use of rooftop solar.

The Esmeralda 7 project “would have destroyed significant archaeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands,” said Kevin Emmerich, a co-founder of Nevada-based Basin and Range Watch.

The cancellation of the project “will give us a chance to protect the tremendous resources of the area, including beautiful and wild mountain ranges and valleys, rare plant populations, and bighorn sheep,” said Laura Cunningham, a biologist with Western Watersheds Project.

“Paleontological fossil beds [the Esmeralda Formation] here were formative to understanding the geological history of the Great Basin,” Cunningham added. “This is good news for recreationists and for conservation efforts of an amazing landscape.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4a%2Fdb%2F0757e1e94a558b25616284763f8a%2F29730315801-859a5b0540-c-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 18:03:05.906238

A new study confirms that commonsense workplace protections from extreme heat — water, shade, breaks — help save workers from being injured on the job.

The finding — something labor and climate advocates have long known and pushed for in public policy — comes just as the federal government shutdown may have suspended the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s lengthy rulemaking process to create the U.S.’s first-ever nationwide heat standard for workers.

Some experts now fear that the agency, which ordinarily takes about seven years on average to establish new rules, will face further delays.

In order to calculate the risk of injury on hot days, researchers from the public health schools at Harvard University and George Washington University utilized OSHA’s database for workplace injuries, pulling nearly 900,000 cases from 2023.

They found that 28,000 injuries were attributable to heat, and that workers in all industry sectors, including those who mostly work indoors, were impacted. The study, published this week, also found that the risk for injury starts to increase when the heat index, a measure of how temperatures really feel to the human body, reaches 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and then becomes even more likely once the heat index passes 90.

“This study elegantly confirms what all of us have experienced,” said Charlotte Brody, vice president of health initiatives at the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups. “When it gets really hot, it’s hard to do hard work safely. And the hotter it gets, the more clumsy and fuzzy thinking we get.”

‘First big picture look’ at state heat standards

Much of the prior research on the impact of heat on workers has focused on illnesses caused by exposure to high temperatures — such at heat stroke, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. By examining the likelihood of workplace injuries on hot days, researchers are revealing other hidden costs of extreme heat — for both laborers and employers.

“It’s very clear that heat causes more than simply heat illness and unfortunately heat fatalities,” said David Michaels, one of the authors of the study and a professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.

“But it also causes thousands of injuries every year. When you’re working in heat, you can much more easily make mistakes.” Michaels also served as the head of OSHA from 2009 to 2017.

“The numbers on this one are a little bit eye-opening,” said Juanita Constible, a senior advocate for environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who described this study as the first national look at the impact of heat on workplace injury. (Barrak Alahmad, lead author of the study and senior research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said his team was not aware of any other nationwide study that covered the contiguous United States.)

Constible added that worker injuries hurt employers’ pocketbooks in the form of workers’ compensation claims. Recently, the insurance company Liberty Mutual found that worker injuries cost employers more than $58 billion in 2021.

Crucially, the study also found that states that have enacted their own heat standards to protect workers had a lower risk of injury on hot days compared to states that lack such rules. Constible considered this “the most critical piece of the paper.” She added, “It’s the first big picture look that we have at how well standards are working to reduce these kinds of traumatic health problems.”

The idea that working on hot days may not just be uncomfortable, but also potentially dangerous, is likely not surprising to labor and climate advocates. It’s also probably unsurprising to anyone who has had to work on hot days.

“People know it intuitively when they’re out mowing their lawn for a few hours and they get really hot and miserable, right?” said Constible. “It impairs our judgment, makes our hands slippy, affects our posture.”

With time, the human body can become acclimated to hotter temperatures. But employers often use this to justify not providing basic necessities like water, rest breaks, and shade to workers, said Brody. “This study shows that hot weather creates more workplace injuries and that a commonsense heat rule matters,” she said.

Shutdown complicates OSHA rulemaking on heat

OSHA is currently in the process of receiving final comments from parties that testified on a Biden-era proposal for a national heat rule earlier this year. But the federal government shutdown could potentially drag on or complicate this phase. “I think we can expect that this will lead to delays in promulgating an OSHA rule,” said Brody.

Constible, who testified at an OSHA hearing on the proposed heat rule in June, said that what the ultimate impact of the shutdown will be is unclear. For now, the online portal through which she and others can submit final comments to the agency remains active. Since the shutdown began last Wednesday, OSHA has not extended its deadline for comments, which is currently Oct. 30.

But could a prolonged federal funding shortage change that? The online portal is, after all, just a website, that “like all the others, requires maintenance,” said Constible. Without that, “the question is: Will it continue to work?” She noted that there is an option to email comments to the agency. “If the deadline does not get extended and the website’s not working, then we’ll just start emailing. Or I’ll walk down to OSHA’s office.”

Grist’s emailed request to OSHA for comment returned an automatic message citing the government shutdown as a reason why the account is not being monitored.

Even if the current heat standard proposal continues to move through OSHA without a shutdown-related delay, Constible and Brody expressed concern it may ultimately be watered down — due to industry groups who say following standards is expensive and burdensome and President Donald Trump’s deregulatory agenda.

Michaels, however, argued that, “if the Trump administration recognizes the importance of protecting workers, they will issue a strong standard.”

The average permitting process takes four to five years to complete, which delays an estimated total of $1.5 trillion in investment.

Permit delays impact telecommunications, transit, and dozens of other industries. For example, more than 3,000 homes and businesses in Bedford County, Virginia, were supposed to be connected to the internet via fiber cables by October 2025, but the project was postponed to June 2026, in part due to the problems with obtaining a railroad-crossing permit. An August 4, 2025, Los Angeles Times article noted that third-party permitting requirements were among the reasons for the excessive costs and delays in California’s High-Speed Rail project.

Congress and the Trump administration are working to modernize the permitting process. On July 25, 2025, House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) introduced H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, which would shorten permitting timelines and limit the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. On September 9, 2025, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced new guidance on preconstruction permitting requirements for power generation and reshoring manufacturing projects. At the state level, the National Governors Association has urged Congress to be more proactive about permitting change, while governors are taking legislative action in their states.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘ Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.","As Colorado darts toward a future powered by “clean” energy, a battle is brewing in Pueblo, where coal closures, union jobs and lost tax revenue collide with a community demanding a solution as its power plants are a primary target for a shutdown.

Between 2025 and 2031, six more coal-fired power plants in Colorado are scheduled to be shut down or converted to another energy source, such as natural gas.

With more than 800 jobs to be affected, another three plants are on the list for future closures.

The closures are raising alarm bells, notably for the unions that count the power plant workers as members. A group has put forward an action plan called the Colorado Energy Compact, calling for a “balanced and sustainable energy policy” and a transition that is “clear, stable, and grounded in the realities of our grid, our workforce, and our economy.”

Besides unions and jobs, taxes paid to local communities are also a major worry, with revenue ranging from 12% of the total collected in Pueblo County to as high as 33.7% in Moffat County.

The compact is drawing together more than two dozen organizations and individual experts in energy, labor and public policy, according to Action Colorado’s Sara Blackhurst.

The plan is designed as both a tool and an accountability check for lawmakers and regulators, focusing on a state standard that, the compact maintains, should be technology-neutral and which supports a balanced mix of current and emerging technologies. The goal, the compact said, is to ensure a transition that benefits Colorado’s environmental and economic future, protects families, and sustains local economies.

The fight over Comanche plants

In Pueblo, residents are fighting back to keep the Comanche power plants open. They oppose wind or solar energy, which they claim is unreliable.

The Comanche station just south of Pueblo is a 695-acre site with a rail system, water contracts, transmission capacity and injection, according to a report from the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee. It includes three coal-generating units “that have provided highly-paid, family supporting jobs and tax payments of tens of millions of dollars for decades,” the report said.

Comanche 1 closed in 2022. Comanche 2 will close in 2025. Comanche 3, which opened in 2010, will close no later than Jan. 1, 2031, about 10 years ahead of schedule.

The controversy surrounding the Comanche power plants comes at a time when the Trump administration has withdrawn support for “clean” energy, cutting over $500 million in grants to Colorado companies and universities. Additionally, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a Colorado native, said he wants to “unleash American energy at home and abroad.” Wright said America should focus on ensuring a wide array of cheap, abundant and sustainable energy sources that include geothermal, nuclear, oil and gas.

The campaign to save the Comanche plants suggests a major battle is brewing over the two Xcel units in Pueblo.

The Colorado Fiscal Institute, in a Sept. 2024 report, said the closure of Comanche 3 alone will cost about 77 jobs and about $31 million annually in tax revenue to the Pueblo community.

The same report said the Environmental Protection Agency’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment tool estimated that closing Comanche 3 would result in avoided health costs benefiting Colorado between $52 million and $67 million annually, with Pueblo County specifically benefiting between $4.6 million and $5.6 million.

The report downplayed the benefits of nuclear energy as a replacement energy source and instead recommended wind and solar.

On the opposite side, the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, a group initiated by Xcel Energy and made up of community leaders, has looked at potential replacements for the energy sources at Comanche 3.

The PIESAC group is led by attorney Frances Koncilja and investor Corinne Koehler; members Jerry Bellah, vice president of IBEW local 8; Sara Blackhurst of Action Colorado; Russell De Salvo, who heads the Pueblo Depot Authority; Patty Erjavec, former president of Pueblo Community College; former judge Dennis Maes; Timothy Mottet, a former president of CSU-Pueblo; Duane Nava, head of the Greater Pueblo Chamber; Jeff Shaw, president of Pueblo Economic Development; and former Pueblo County Commissioner Chris Wiseman.

The group’s report, which came out in January 2024, looked at all the impacts, noting “the Pueblo community has supported these early closures and done more to reduce emissions in the state than any other community.”

The report said the economic hit from closing Comanche 3 would total $196 million to Pueblo and result in the loss of hundreds of high-wage, career-level jobs. Pueblo would lose more than $845 million in tax revenues by 2070, the report added.

Its proposed solution: “Of all the technologies we studied, only advanced nuclear generation will make Pueblo whole and also provide a path to prosperity.”

The group believes that nuclear power would support 200 to 300 permanent high-paying jobs and generate $95 million in local property taxes.

The backup plan is combined cycle natural gas plant with carbon capture for 20 to 25 long-term jobs and about $16.5 million in annual tax revenue.

Wind and solar would generate “a handful of non-union jobs” and about $2 million annually in tax revenue, PIESAC said.

‘Just transition’

In August, the Public Utilities Commission deliberated on the first phase of a $15 billion “just transition” energy resource plan submitted by Xcel, Colorado’s largest utility company and operator of the Pueblo plants, that includes the future of the Comanche operations.

The plan is tied to a settlement agreement reached in 2022 between Xcel and partners that include state agencies, environmental groups, local governments, including the city of Pueblo and Pueblo County, and large customers, such as Walmart, and labor unions.

The “just transition” plan would add more than 6,000 megawatts of new generation and storage. Over the next five years, Xcel would add 10,000 megawatts of new generation and storage capacity. Final approval of both phases of the plan, according to Xcel, is expected sometime next year.

The settlement agreement aims to keep Pueblo “whole” regarding tax revenue by compensating the county for property tax revenue due to the acceleration of the retirement date of Comanche 3.

During the meeting, PUC Chair Eric Blank called the “just transition” plan the “single largest resource acquisition in the history of Colorado and an over $15 billion commitment from customers.”

The plan’s cost raised worries among the commission about its potential for “exorbitant” hikes in utility rates to ratepayers.

The PUC said it would issue a final decision on the first phase in the coming weeks.

In a statement issued by the Colorado Energy Office after the meeting, Gov. Jared Polis said he is “enthusiastic about the plan to save people money and achieve faster pollution reductions while bringing new jobs to communities and investing in rural Colorado.”

Polis added that “the free market is driving the transition to clean energy in a way that will help people hold on to more of their hard-earned money, clean our air, achieve energy independence, and continue our state’s economic growth.”

For its part, Xcel said it is committed to supporting its workforce both in Pueblo and Hayden with “reskilling and retraining programs, and efforts to retain employees in both the short and long term.” The company also said it is committed to addressing the tax revenue issue and listening to the voices of local leaders.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘

Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.

At the end of August, Pueblo County commissioners fought back, telling the PUC through a filing that they had invested limited financial resources and time to participate in the PUC’s proceeding, “as well as the promised follow-on ‘Pueblo Just Transition Solicitation’ to ensure that the residents of Pueblo County would receive a meaningful ‘Just Transition’ from a coal community to a high tech clean energy hub.”

The county also spent $2 million on the PIESAC study to develop clean energy generation options for Pueblo, and if implemented, those options, they said, would render Pueblo “whole.”

The commissioners claimed other partners in a settlement agreement, including the Colorado Energy Office, ignored Pueblo’s “bargained-for solutions.” They accused the Colorado Energy Office, the Office of Just Transitions and the Utility Consumer Advocate, which is part of PUC, of failing to act in good faith, including failing to consider the option of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement energy source.

The commissioners asked that Comanche 2 and Comanche 3 continue to operate, saying they would approach the Trump administration and Wright, the energy secretary, “until replacement generation is constructed in Pueblo.”

“The (PUC) has made it clear that it is a futile exercise to participate in these proceedings,” the county commissioners wrote.

The local electrical worker union in Pueblo also weighed in through a letter submitted to U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Grand Junction, whose district includes Pueblo.

In a Sept. 10 letter, Jerry Bellah, international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, told Hurd his group supports green energy “but that the green jobs being offered to Pueblo do not come close to replacing the jobs that are currently at Comanche.”

Bellah said the handful of solar farm jobs are low-paying positions.

“For too long, the hardworking men and women of the IBEW have been ignored with false promises of middle-class, family-supporting jobs in exchange for our support in closing coal plants,” Bellah wrote. “We are smart enough, however, to know when we are getting the shaft, which is what is being done to the Pueblo community and the workers at Comanche. We all deserve better than this.”

Bellah noted Hurd had reached out to Trump to keep Comanche open and said his group would “support any elected leader, regardless of party, who supports jobs, and we will oppose any elected leader who votes to end our jobs.”

Pueblo County voters have now twice voted for Trump over his Democratic opponents.

Blackhurst of Action Colorado added that the union jobs issue is the primary reason for the energy compact.

“Pueblo is being robbed,” she told Colorado Politics. “They (state government) have made labor workers acceptable collateral,” as well as the communities in which they live and work.

The Colorado Energy Compact

Led by Action Colorado, the compact’s authors intend for it to provide a roadmap for building an energy future that is “ambitious, achievable, and rooted in Colorado’s best interests.”

It focuses on five areas — affordability and economic competitiveness; labor, community and “just transition;” energy system reliability and feasibility; legal and regulatory integrity; and transparency and accountability.

The first focus area, on affordability, would look at the cost to consumers, protecting the tax revenue base and long-term economic resilience.

The second focus — on labor and community — said any legislation or regulation should ensure comparable wages and benefits, as well as “enforceable” retraining, union participation and local hiring. It also calls for policies that allow workers to stay in their current communities.

A survey conducted by Colorado Mountain College and the state Office of Just Transition, and as reported by the Steamboat Pilot in March, said 61% of workers at the Craig Xcel plant and the Colowyo and Trapper mines want to stay in their local communities if they transition to new jobs.

The third focus — on energy system reliability — calls for a “realistic” phasing of timelines tied to permitting, workforce readiness and infrastructure — “not political deadlines.” It also recognizes the role of natural gas and emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, geothermal and nuclear power, which was added to the state’s list of “clean” energy technologies by the legislature in the 2025 session.

In the focus on legal and regulatory integrity, the compact said terms like “clean energy” and “eligible technologies” must be defined in law, not by regulators.

Additionally, transparency and accountability must include an open stakeholder process, with full notice and “without surprises” and models made public and independently validated, the compact said. It should also include a regular public review.

“Without accountability,” the compact said, “even well-intentioned rules look like closed-door deals and public trust collapses.”

Blackhurst told Colorado Politics that the groups behind the compact are sharing it with lawmakers, hoping it would provide a tool for reviewing legislation in the future.

That’s critical, Blackhurst said, as the PUC is going through a sunset review in the 2026 session.

A fact sheet provided to the Town of Gilchrist earlier this year stated that the compact, unlike the governor’s “top-down” Clean Energy Planning process, is more inclusive and offers a framework rooted in local control.

It is not a lobbying effort, the fact sheet insisted. But “without stakeholder-driven guardrails, the direction will be set by others — without you in the room,” it said.

Gilchrist town councilmembers unanimously approved joining the compact in August, along with providing some financial support.

Office of Just Transition

Approved by legislation in 2019, the Office of Just Transition focuses on economic development for communities affected by the closure of coal mines.

For the past several years, the office, with 3.5 full-time employees, has spent about $15 million annually on community development, worker education, and training for those areas.

What’s missing, many said, is wage parity — what workers earn when they transition from high-paying jobs to whatever comes next.

The BlueGreen Alliance, in a 2023 report, pointed to the wage parity issue.

When coal mines close, workers are vulnerable to job loss, and many will struggle to find comparable employment that aligns with their existing skills, experience, and compensation levels, according to the report.

The office has made progress in economic development by supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship, the report added. But the opportunities to find local “high-road” jobs for former coal workers have been missed.

“The quality of the job — such as the benefits offered like health insurance, a retirement plan, and workers’ compensation benefits, or wage parity to previous employment — is not being considered in program development or implementation” for OJT, the alliance said.

‘Extreme claims‘

In a response to Pueblo commissioners on Sept. 12, several environmental groups said any decision by PUC to change votes would lead to further controversy and litigation over procedural improprieties.

That’s a reference to comments by Blank, the PUC chairman, in a Sept. 4 hearing that he is considering taking “another look at some of the labor issues raised in the county’s response,” as well as revisiting a prior vote tied to Xcel’s plans for “credits for resource located in communities with retiring coal plants,” a main concern raised by Pueblo County.

The credits are part of a Near Term Procurement request by Xcel — a solicitation for the development of energy generation that would draw federal and state tax credits.

The coalition of environmental groups includes GreenLatinos, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado.

“Moreover, promising to revisit votes in response to baseless accusations of political bias and extreme claims (including a threat to invite federal interference) sets problematic precedent and may incentivize parties to make similarly baseless and extreme claims in the future to get the Commission’s attention when they are displeased with the Commissioner’s oral deliberations and decisions,” the coalition said.

The coalition, in particular, took issue with Blank’s statements and the Sept. 4 hearing, which the group said hinted at “unfairness,” since the PUC had already deliberated on the Xcel plan in August and failed to provide opportunities to other parties to address the issues raised by Pueblo County.

By revisiting votes on the Xcel plan, the PUC would reward Pueblo County for “flouting the Commission’s well-established hearing and deliberations process” without allowing other parties the same opportunity, the coalition said.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/default-social-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 19:02:45.328168

“This bill will ensure that California adopts best-in-class regulations for carbon dioxide pipeline safety through a public process that elevates community input while encouraging major investment in the clean energy transition of our most fossil fuel intensive industries,” said Senator Stern. “I am grateful to Governor Newsom for charting this new path.”

In 2022, Governor signed SB 905 (Caballero) as part of the Climate Commitment to encourage the development of these projects in California with the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework. SB 614 builds off this effort and supports these projects with the authorization to develop safe carbon dioxide pipelines from where the carbon is captured and removed to where it will be permanently stored. In addition, SB 840 (Limon) allocates $85 million in the 2026-27 budget year from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to advance climate-focused technological innovation, related research, and the deployment of climate solutions, such as carbon capture and removal projects. The GGRF is supported by revenue generated from the state’s world-leading Cap-and-Trade, now Cap-and-Invest program, which places a price on climate pollution. These efforts are examples of policy momentum aimed at fostering the decarbonized economy of tomorrow.

“Carbon capture is an important part of the climate puzzle – we need CCUS technologies to deliver on our climate goals and build California’s clean energy future,” said bill co-author Assemblymember Petrie-Norris. “I’m grateful for the Governor’s partnership to ensure the safe deployment of carbon pipelines in California. SB 614 will accelerate California’s climate progress, spur billions of dollars in climate investments, and create thousands of high road jobs across the state.”

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy.

Esmeralda 7 was supposed to produce a gargantuan 6.2 gigawatts of power – equal to nearly all the power supplied to southern Nevada by the state’s primary public utility. It would do so with a sprawling web of solar panels and batteries across the western Nevada desert. Backed by NextEra Energy, Invenergy, ConnectGen and other renewables developers, the project was moving forward at a relatively smooth pace under the Biden administration, albeit with significant concerns raised by environmentalists about its impacts on wildlife and fauna. And Esmeralda 7 even received a rare procedural win in the early days of the Trump administration when the Bureau of Land Management released the draft environmental impact statement for the project.

When Esmeralda 7’s environmental review was released, BLM said the record of decision would arrive in July. But that never happened. Instead, Donald Trump issued an executive order as part of a deal with conservative hardliners in Congress to pass his tax megabill, which also effectively repealed the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable electricity tax credits. This led to subsequent actions by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to freeze all federal permitting decisions for solar energy.

Flash forward to today, when BLM quietly updated its website for Esmeralda 7 permitting to explicitly say the project’s status is “cancelled.” Normally when the agency says this, it means developers pulled the plug.

Carmaker walks back program that would have allowed dealers to offer $7,500 US tax credit

Ford Motor is walking back a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 US tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired Sept. 30, the company said on Thursday.

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today,"" a spokesperson said.

The decision follows a similar move from General Motors on Wednesday. While automakers including Hyundai and Stellantis have offered cash off incentives to bridge the gap for buyers, Ford and GM took a different approach.

The in-house lending arms at these two automakers planned to initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory, and the companies would apply for the $7,500 SU credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives, a spokesperson said.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. It is unclear why Ford canceled its program.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: A Rhode Island labor union earlier this week filed a lawsuit to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency’s effort to cancel $7 billion in funding for the Solar for All program. The initiative established by the Biden Inflation Reduction Act helped low-income communities install solar energy, while creating jobs in the field.

Amy Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island said, “Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy.”

“EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program,” Romero said.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PULLS THE PLUG ON NEVADA SOLAR PROJECT: The Bureau of Land Management canceled Nevada’s massive solar project yesterday evening.

The department updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 solar project, stating that the environmental review has been “canceled.” The agency did not provide a reason for the cancellation. The project cancellation was first reported by Heatmap.

The Esmeralda 7 project would have built seven solar power plants with battery energy storage on nearly 118,000 acres of federal land near Tonopah, Nevada. The project would have produced nearly 6.2 gigawatts of power.

The cancellation of the project is part of a series of moves by the Trump administration to stymie clean energy projects. BLM’s move furthers the administration’s efforts to hinder renewable energy sources like offshore wind projects.

TRUMP RESPONDS TO CHINA ON RARE EARTHS: President Donald Trump responded this morning to China’s move to curb rare earth element exports by threatening a “massive” increase in tariffs.

“There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least,” the president wrote in a post to Truth Social.

He also threatened unspecified other “countermeasures,” and suggested that he would be canceling the planned meeting with Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Korea later this month.

KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE REVIVAL: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said today that a proposal to revive the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta to the U.S. could help economies of both countries.

“We are looking for areas where the integration of our economies will be better for us both. We have opportunities in the energy sector – there are many possible projects, including Keystone XL, but there are others,” Carney said at a press conference, Reuters reports.

Carney floated the idea during a meeting with Trump earlier this week to discuss easing tariffs. The approvals for the pipeline permits have fluctuated depending on the administration in power.

Former President Barack Obama denied the pipeline’s permit. It was later revived during Trump’s first term, and then it was revoked by former President Joe Biden.

CURTIS TO LEAD COP30 DELEGATION: Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah will lead a bipartisan delegation to the COP30 global climate conference next month in Brazil, alongside Sen. Chris Coons.

Curtis told E&E News that at least three other Republicans expressed interest in the trip.

There won’t be an executive branch delegation, as the relevant State Department offices have been limited by the shutdown.

“We have an agenda that is really coming together nicely. We’re super happy with it,” Curtis told the outlet.

For years now, Curtis has been one of the Republicans most engaged on the issue of climate change. As a member of the House, he formed a GOP group dedicated to climate change.

OIL DROPS BELOW $60 AS RISKS DECLINE: Oil prices hit the lowest levels in months as traders digested the implementation of the peace deal between Israel and Hamas.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the $60 a barrel mark this morning, a drop of nearly 4%. Brent crude dipped below $63.

“Finally having some kind of peace process in the Middle East is lowering the shoulders a little bit,” Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, told Reuters. He said that the deal could ease fears about oil tankers passing through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea.

‘DRILL, BABY, DRILL’ UPDATE: The U.S. oil and gas rig count fell this week by two to 547, Baker Hughes said today.

The rig count is now down 7% on the year.

The lower prices this week will likely not help with the pessimism in the industry.

STORM TO HIT THE EAST COAST THIS WEEKEND: A nor’easter storm is set to hit the East Coast this weekend, bringing flooding, heavy winds, and beach erosion.

The storm is forecast to develop off the Florida coast and then move northward this weekend into next week. There is potential for major flooding in places like North Carolina, New Jersey, and Cape Cod.

What is a nor’easter? It is a storm that occurs along the East Coast, bringing coastal winds inland. The wind direction is what defines a nor’easter. The storm carries winds from the northeast at around 58 mph or more. It could cause beach erosion and coastal flooding.

“This will be a damaging storm for some along the Atlantic coast,” AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.

TEN LARGE NUCLEAR REACTORS UNDERWAY IN NEXT FIVE YEARS? BECHTEL SAYS YES: Bechtel CEO Craig Albert said that it is possible to have 10 new large nuclear plants under construction in the next five years, if the risks of projects are shared properly among stakeholders. That aligns with the goal laid out in Trump’s nuclear power executive order.

“Everyone at the table realizes they’re going to have to take on more risk than they have in the past,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.

Bechtel has built 80% of the U.S. nuclear fleet, including the most recently built one, the Vogtle plant in Georgia. That project was subject to huge cost overruns.

Albert said that the company would be willing to take on more risks for future projects. In the past, it has been paid based on its time and effort.

U.S. WEIGHS FUNDING FOR GREENLAND’S POLAR BEARS: State Department officials are working on proposals to spend $50 million protecting polar bears in Greenland and $25 million for snow leopards in Nepal, the Washington Post reports.

That would equate to around $100,000 per polar bear.

The funding is especially noteworthy because the Trump administration has tried to slash funding not aligned with its America First agenda.

The publication notes that some observers have flagged that the two countries in question are particularly sensitive with respect to the Trump administration’s aims. Trump, of course, has repeatedly discussed taking control of Greenland. And Nepal is of geopolitical importance because of its location between China and India.

Trump’s nomination of Douglas Troutman to be the Environmental Protection Agency’s assistant administrator for toxic substances fell along partisan lines at a confirmation hearing Oct. 8: Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee praised his experience, while Democrats voiced concerns about his industry ties. Both sides asked him about efforts to speed up chemical reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), but from different perspectives.

Ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called Troutman an “industry operative” who “has spent his entire career as a lobbyist for oil, gas, and chemical interests . . . aping the fossil fuel disinformation campaign to undermine science and obstruct efforts aimed at protecting people from pollution.”

Whitehouse said in his opening remarks that he has “zero confidence that Mr. Troutman cares either about chemical safety or pollution prevention.”

But Republicans, including EPW chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said Troutman’s tenure at the American Cleaning Institute—a cleaning products industry association, where he led legal and government affairs for more than a decade—has prepared him well for the role.

Troutman couldn’t respond directly to Whitehouse’s opening remarks but said in his testimony that, if confirmed, he is committed to working to “provide a clean, safe environment, with an eye toward strong economic growth.”

Questions on PFAS, new chemical reviews

Capito kicked off questioning by asking Troutman about the speed and efficiency of chemical safety reviews under TSCA, which Troutman would oversee. “American innovators need certainty,” she told Troutman, before asking, “What specific reforms would you pursue to achieve both faster reviews and predictable, commercially viable outcomes?”

Troutman did not cite any specific reforms, but he said he would follow statutory requirements while welcoming new staff and information technology resources that will help deliver his promise to press for more “timely” and “certain” reviews of chemicals.

The EPA has taken a number of steps this year to streamline its process for reviewing new chemicals. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced a program last month to begin “expeditious reviews” of chemicals relevant to the buildout of data center infrastructure for the artificial intelligence sector.

Troutman said that his intent is for “nothing to change with regard to [EPA’s] robust reviews of new and existing chemicals based on the risk-based process under TSCA.” But Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) pushed back. “Zeldin said that the Trump EPA is going to ‘get out of the way,’ so that these [data centers] can be built without protections against toxic chemicals,” he told Troutman. “I'm not hearing you say that you’re going to stand up to him.”

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) pressed Troutman on the health risks of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), microplastics, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals highlighted in the White House’s recent Make America Healthy Again report and stressed the need for clear action to minimize harm that can come from the use of plastics. Troutman acknowledged the concerns and alluded to ongoing EPA programs and interagency strategies but offered few specifics.

“I’m expecting a strategy of doing nothing,” Merkley said. “I’d love for you to surprise us.”

Pesticides use was also discussed at length. “Crop protection tools such as glyphosate and dicamba are critical to modern agricultural practices,” Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NB) said. He urged Troutman to propose some kind of reform to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the nation’s primary federal pesticide law. FIFRA regulates pesticides in a way that “doesn’t reflect what’s really happening on farmers’ fields,” Ricketts said. Troutman said that, if confirmed, he’s committed to following FIFRA’s risk-based statutory requirements.

Several lawmakers, including Merkley and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA), grilled Troutman on the EPA’s recently proposed changes to implementing TSCA that would, among other things, limit the agency’s consideration of fence-line or “overburdened” communities when assessing the risks of chemicals.

“We see in study after study that cancer rates are higher around certain facilities,” Merkley said. But, “when asked if you believe certain communities have higher risk to harmful chemicals, you chose not to answer with a simple yes or no,” Padilla told Troutman. Instead, Troutman made “a big circular, bureaucratic journey around the question,” Merkley said.

The committee will accept written questions from senators, along with the nominee’s responses, by Oct. 17 and 27, respectively, and will then deliberate and vote on whether to advance Troutman's nomination to the full Senate.

New factory in Austin to anchor U.S. energy resilience and grid modernisation efforts.

Participation in Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource program enables homeowners to feed power directly into the grid.

Austin startup aims to decentralize the grid

Base Power, a fast-growing energy technology company based in Austin, has raised $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the rollout of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by venture firm Addition, with participation from Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, and Elad Gil, as well as new investors including Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The funding positions Base Power among the most well-capitalized startups in the U.S. energy transition, reflecting investor confidence in distributed energy solutions as the grid faces mounting strain from extreme weather, ageing infrastructure, and rising electrification demand.

CEO and co-founder Zach Dell said the company is driven by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent how power is generated, stored, and shared. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality,” he said.

Distributed storage meets domestic manufacturing

Base Power’s business model revolves around leasing batteries directly to homeowners, offering reliable backup power while allowing participants to sell excess energy back to the grid. This decentralised system strengthens grid resilience and helps integrate renewable energy, addressing one of the core challenges of the U.S. clean energy transition: balancing supply and demand in real time.

As part of its expansion strategy, Base Power is developing its first energy storage and power electronics manufacturing facility at the former Austin American-Statesman printing press site in downtown Austin. The company plans to establish additional facilities to meet surging demand for distributed battery systems.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware,” said co-founder and COO Andrew Lopas. “We need to make that hardware here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning our second.”

By investing in domestic production, Base Power is aligning with national efforts to reindustrialize the energy sector, reduce dependence on imported components, and strengthen supply chain resilience — a priority under the Biden administration’s clean energy and manufacturing policies.

Powering the grid from the ground up

Base Power recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, allowing it to aggregate thousands of home batteries and sell electricity directly into the state’s power market. The initiative could prove pivotal for grid operators struggling with growing demand volatility and the integration of intermittent renewables.

The company’s distributed model also complements recent federal initiatives encouraging grid-edge technologies, such as the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. With utilities and regulators seeking cost-effective ways to improve reliability, distributed batteries — collectively acting as “virtual power plants” — are emerging as a scalable alternative to large, centralized infrastructure.

For investors, the model offers exposure to one of the fastest-growing segments of the energy transition: behind-the-meter storage. BloombergNEF projects U.S. residential battery capacity could increase fivefold by 2030, driven by falling costs, rising solar adoption, and regional incentive programs.

Rebuilding American energy capacity

Beyond its immediate commercial ambitions, Base Power’s approach speaks to a broader transformation in the U.S. energy economy — one that blends software, manufacturing, and local ownership to rebuild resilience from the household level up.

The company’s long-term vision extends beyond residential markets. Executives have indicated interest in expanding to small businesses, microgrids, and community-scale deployments, leveraging the same distributed platform to support energy equity and grid flexibility.

As Lopas put it, “We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrialising America and reinventing the grid.”

If successful, Base Power’s model could help redefine how power is produced and consumed in the world’s largest economy — turning homes into active participants in the clean energy transition while strengthening the backbone of U.S. grid infrastructure.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Base-Power-Secures-1B-to-scale-U.S.-Home-Battery-Network.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 20:02:45.603667

The state’s efforts to install infrastructure for electric vehicles have fallen short of its goals.

That’s according to a recent audit report from State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. It's a follow-up for an initial audit in 2022.

It determined that NYPA had not placed chargers in optimal locations and failed to review and analyze usage data for better charger placement.

It also found that the New York Power Authority’s installation of high speed EV chargers was as much as two years behind schedule.

For example, of the 200 chargers that were scheduled to be installed by the end of 2019, only 29 had actually been placed by March of 2021.

Amazon prioritized bio-based materials for the facility’s construction, with wood studs instead of metal ones at interior partitions, wood fiber insulation instead of fiberglass, and an ultra-light, lower-carbon alternative to standard drywall.

The retailer also used lower-carbon, bio-based finishes for the acoustic ceilings and flooring and salvaged wood for 43 desks used by the site operations team.

Heat pumps reduce carbon emissions and don’t require burning fossil fuels on-site, while “air curtains,” which prevent outdoor air from entering the building, are intended to reduce air-conditioning usage and boost employee comfort.

In addition, Amazon says the clerestory windows in the warehouse and the glazed glass in the office block bring in enough daylight to allow for less electrical lighting and the interior LED lighting is designed to reduce power usage.

Other sustainable features include a water reclamation system and more than 170 electric-vehicle charging stalls located outside. In total, Amazon says the facility features more than 40 technologies designed to reduce resource usage and shrink its carbon footprint.

""We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,"" said Daniel Mallory, VP of global realty, Amazon, in a corporate blog post. ""DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them.

(NYSE: TE) (“T1,” “T1 Energy,” or the “Company”) has made a strategic investment in Talon PV LLC (“Talon”), acquiring a minority equity stake in the developer of a solar cell fab.

T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Talon is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell plant in Baytown, Texas. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S.

The T1 and Talon projects are examples of American companies investing in American energy, supported by President Trump’s OBBBA and 45x tax credits. The Texas projects are expected to reshore jobs and deliver power to meet rising electrical demand driven by AI, industrialization and residential load growth.

Both projects are expected to meaningfully add domestic manufacturing capacity and produce TOPCon solar cells, the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S. TOPCon cells utilize the quantum tunneling technology awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics earlier this week.

Under terms of the deal, T1 has entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire an equity stake in Talon. T1 and Talon remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

T1 Energy owns the 5 GW G1_Dallas solar module facility in Wilmer, Texas, and this summer signed a long-term deal with Corning Inc to obtain polysilicon and solar wafers manufactured in Michigan.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of U.S. solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Talon.

Talon PV LLC is a privately held U.S. company developing an advanced 4.8 GW TOPCon solar cell manufacturing fab with anticipated commercial availability starting in Q1 2027. The company is majority owned by Eagle Group, a diversified industrial firm with a long-standing commitment to investing in and advancing American energy production.

(WSAV) — State leaders are looking for new ways to keep electric vehicle (EV) interest charged up — after federal tax credits for EV buyers expired at the end of September.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, created under the ‘Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,’ had offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. But a bill signed in July shortened its end date from 2032 to September 30, 2025, effectively ending the incentive early.

‘Range Anxiety’ No Longer a Major Issue

EV owners say Georgia’s expanding charging infrastructure is helping ease common concerns about long-distance travel.

“The charging network in Georgia is really being built out in a very robust and easy way,” said James Marlow, President of Southface and an EV owner. “When I drive to the Georgia coast, it’s no problem to stop, charge, and grab food or coffee. Charging is becoming much less of an issue.”

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Georgia now has over 90,000 registered EVs and about 2,200 charging stationsstatewide.

Local Incentives May Be the Next Step

With federal credits now gone, experts say car manufacturers and local governments may need to step in with new incentives to keep buyers interested.

“The withdrawal of incentives has definitely changed the market,” Marlow said. “But if you zoom out, electric vehicles now make up about 10% of the U.S. new car market — and that’s growing.”

He also pointed to falling battery costs, which are expected to make EVs more affordable in the coming years.

Cheaper to Operate, Easier to Charge

“I have a Tesla 3, and a full charge to 80% costs me about $12,” Marlow said. “That’s compared to nearly $60 for a full tank of gas in my Jeep — so it’s cheaper to operate.”

The Georgia Department of Transportation is currently reviewing roadways to identify potential “charging deserts” and plans to expand access across rural and suburban areas.

The ‘Battery Belt of the South’

Governor Brian Kemp has called Georgia the ‘Battery Belt of the South’— as major EV manufacturers like SK Battery, Rivian, Kia, and Hyundai continue to expand operations in the state.

Hydrogen may not grab headlines like electric cars, but it may yet power a good share of the future.","This week we received a release from Nebraska Public Power District marking the 11th annual National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Observation, which takes place each Oct. 8 in a nod to hydrogen’s atomic weight of 1.008. The release was straightforward and refreshingly free of political rhetoric. Hydrogen, it noted, is already at work providing fuel, feedstock and power to sectors across the United States, with promising applications in everything from transportation to national defense.

Roman Estrada, NPPD’s Generation Research Senior Program Manager, described hydrogen as a “technological solution available today that is flexible, domestically sourced and capable of being deployed across multiple sectors critical to our economy and national defense.” In an era when our energy debates often resemble shouting matches between wind farms and tailpipes, that’s a quietly radical statement.

Hydrogen is not a distant, pie-in-the-sky idea. It’s abundant, energy-dense, and can be produced domestically, creating the kind of economic resilience policymakers say they want but rarely seem to act on. Properly deployed, it can stabilize the grid, reduce emissions, and support industries that can’t be electrified easily — such as freight transportation, heavy manufacturing and aviation. It also has the potential to work alongside, rather than against, other energy sources.

Of course, hydrogen technology isn’t a magic wand. Storage, distribution, and infrastructure challenges remain real and expensive–but so were the early hurdles for natural gas, nuclear power, and yes, electric cars. The difference is that hydrogen never received the kind of marketing blitz or regulatory favoritism that battery electric vehicles did. Billions in subsidies and incentives have been shoveled toward lithium batteries, often with modest gains in performance, persistent supply chain vulnerabilities and as discussed in yesterday’s Gazette, a substantial fire hazard.

The federal government has invested tens of billions of dollars in subsidizing electric vehicles through a combination of tax credits, grants, and infrastructure spending. Much of that commitment stems from provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded and extended tax incentives for EV purchases. Estimates suggest that the cost of these incentives to the government over the coming decade could reach well into the tens of billions of dollars, with each new EV purchase effectively costing taxpayers between $23,000 and $32,000, even though the consumer may receive only a $7,500 credit.

Meanwhile, hydrogen remained the quiet workhorse of laboratories and niche industries — less flashy, more practical, and perhaps, more promising.

We cannot, of course, discuss fuel cell technology without the name Stanley Meyer popping up. Readers may recall Meyer as the man who, in the 1980s, claimed to run a car on water.

Meyer’s work has lived on more in legend than in mainstream engineering journals, but it’s a reminder that the allure of hydrogen isn’t new. The difference now is that the science has matured and technology is catching up.

If NPPD makes it a point to formally recognize the potential, it’s worth asking a simple question: what if we’d spent a fraction of the effort pushing hydrogen that we spent subsidizing a single drivetrain technology? We might be a lot closer to energy independence — and a lot less dependent on what’s happening in someone else’s rare earth mine.

The annual report is mandated in statute by the legislature.

“With the expansion of regional hubs, a growing portfolio of grant-funded projects, and hands-on commercialization support, NCInnovation is delivering on its mission to accelerate the commercialization of UNC system applied research,” NCI President and CEO Bennet Waters said in a press release.

“The university-to-industry pipeline has long underpinned American innovation, and North Carolina remains well positioned to create regional economic development from its world-class research successes,” said Waters.

NCInnovation (NCI) is the nonprofit university research accelerator that was given a $500 million endowment by the General Assembly in the state’s 2022-23 budget. Under that endowment, NCI was allowed to use $50 million as investment income in the 2023-24 fiscal year and $90 million in the 2024-25 fiscal year.

Of the $500 million, $140 million was authorized for direct spending, but NCI instead invested the principal amount, accumulating around $20 million in interest that was put toward the group’s first set of grants. NCI also raised $25 million in outside funding from companies and businesses, which was used for items like salaries and operating expenses.

The NCI 2025 Annual Report includes $18.8 million in research funding awarded to 14 UNC System schools for 25 active projects since NCI launched.

“Our role is to ensure that university researchers in North Carolina are not just commercializing breakthrough ideas, but that those ideas have the resources, partnerships, and strategic support needed to get to the next stage here where they are started,” said NCI’s Executive Vice President and CIO Michelle Bolas. “This Annual Report shows our commitment to incorporating those best practices for the ultimate success of our innovators and other partners.”

Also noted was the expansion of NCI’s Regional Innovation Network from four hubs to seven, the launch of the entrepreneur-in-residence program, and more than 250 partnerships statewide across various industries with a focus on biohealth, agtech, defense, advanced manufacturing and energy transition.

NCI’s 2025 annual report is 72 pages long and includes detailed descriptions of the projects approved for grant funding.

Pilot grants totaled more than $2.3 million for eight grants across seven schools, and statewide RFP grants totaled nearly $7.6 million, according to the report.

Total expenses were stated at just under $12.3 million, including grants, more than $1.5 million in salaries and benefits, and regional hub expenses just below $850,000.

The pilot grants in the report include:

• $974,000 for East Carolina (biohealth) melanoma treatment

• $1,082,696 for UNC Wilmington (biohealth) multiyear vaccine development

• $999,963 for Western Carolina (biohealth) mosquito-borne infectious disease identification and risk assessment

• $641,951 for Appalachian State (AgTech) beehive improvement and monitoring system

• $369,024 for North Carolina A&T (biohealth) neuro drug delivery system

• $404,999 for UNC Greensboro (energy transition and electrification) lithium purification

• $400,971 for NC Central (biohealth) drinking water purification

• $354,607 for NC Central (energy transition and electrification) power-grid efficiency

There were 17 statewide RFP grants approved in mid-May totaling $13.6 million across 12 UNC System schools. The projects are described as having “achieved proof of concept” and showing commercial promise.

The largest of the 17 grants, more than $1.1 million, went to UNC Pembroke in the area of biohealth. The project is titled “Alzheimer’s/Traumatic Brain Injury therapeutic.”

The only other project receiving more than $1 million was for a hemp-based biopesticide for commercial poultry houses being worked on at Fayetteville State University.",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NCInnovation-logo.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 00:58:45.904629

The specter of additional, deeper federal funding cuts is haunting the clean-energy sector. A Department of Energy list shared this week with Canary Media suggests the agency is thinking about canceling a whopping $23 billion worth of energy projects.

Well, maybe.

Here’s what we know for sure: Last week, the DOE terminated $7.56 billion in federal funding for grid upgrades and energy projects, which were largely set to benefit Democratic-voting states. Right after, Energy Secretary Chris Wright called the announcement a ​“partial list” and promised that more cuts were coming — in both blue states and red ones.

From there, it gets fuzzier.

On Tuesday, sources shared a leaked spreadsheet with Canary Media that looks a lot like a follow-up to last week’s hit list. It lists the word ​“terminate” next to not only the 321 grant cancellations from last week, but hundreds of other projects too.

But despite headlines declaring this a new wave of grant cancellations, the exact nature of the list remains murky. A former DOE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John that the list is legitimate and that it represents the grants DOE officials have recommended for cancellation to the White House.

DOE, meanwhile, hasn’t confirmed the list’s authenticity and denies that it has yet decided to cancel any of the projects that appear only on the second list. In a statement, the DOE said it is still conducting an ​“individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” and that ​“no determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced.”

Recipients who appeared only on the second list also say they haven’t heard that their grants will be canceled.

Vikrum Aiyer, global policy head at carbon-capture startup Heirloom, whose major hydrogen-hub project was included on the second list, told Canary Media’s Maria Gallucci that the company wasn’t ​“aware of a decision from DOE” to cancel its federal award.

Alliant Energy, a utility holding company whose Wisconsin Power and Light subsidiary was listed on the new spreadsheet, said in a statement that it has not been made aware of changes to its DOE grants.

And aside from the two blue-state hydrogen hubs whose funding was cut last week, several of the firms working on the other five hubs have yet to receive cancellation notices, Alexander C. Kaufman reports.

At best, the latest leaked list is just another layer of chaos and uncertainty for federal funding recipients, who are stuck trying to get answers about the status of their projects from a department that has been depleted by layoffs. At worst, though, it’s a harbinger of billions more in cuts to come for innovative American energy projects.

State and federal hurdles pile up for community solar

Community solar is in trouble, and it’s not just because of federal shakeups, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports. These shared arrays help make solar power accessible to those who can’t put panels on their own roofs, whether that’s because they rent, can’t afford them, or face other barriers. That power can in turn help households reduce their bills.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July set an early sunset for tax credits that can cover as much as half of a community solar array’s cost. And states are also contributing to the decline. Developers in New York, a major community solar market, are facing higher costs for land and permitting, while in Maine, developers have to reckon with changes to its solar net-metering program, as well as lowered compensation and new fees for community solar projects.

Those state challenges, combined with the looming threat of more federal funding cuts, have all led Wood Mackenzie to reduce its forecast of new community solar installations by 8% through 2030.

Global clean energy keeps growing

Two new reports contain some good news for clean energy around the globe. For starters, solar and wind installations outpaced global power demand growth in the first half of this year, according to an analysis out this week from think tank Ember.

The number was inflated by the rush to claim EV tax credits before they expired

Americans bought over 438,000 electric vehicles (EVs) in the third quarter of 2025 – a record number. EVs accounted for 10.5% of all new cars sold, according to Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive.

The figure, however, was inflated by a rush to claim the federal government’s $7,500 EV tax credit before it expired at the end of September.

Fourth-quarter numbers will likely be much lower, as many who would otherwise have bought in Q4 rushed to shop in Q3 while they could still claim the discount.

Some automakers have extended their own $7,500 discounts to keep the vehicles as affordable as possible for the rest of this year.

But scratch the surface and you’ll see that most “options” are just variations of the same puzzle. Insurers continue to toggle the same three levers — premiums, deductibles, and networks — and present them as innovation.

The result? A marketplace that feels more like a shell game than a menu of possibilities. Narrow networks often mean consumers can’t actually see the doctors they want. In rural areas, the choices shrink even further. And this year, there’s a looming complication: the enhanced ACA subsidies that kept coverage affordable for millions are set to expire at the end of 2025.

That financial cushion — first introduced under the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act — has masked how expensive healthcare truly is. When it disappears, many families will feel the full cost of care for the first time. But while the system may seem rigged, consumers aren’t powerless. A few disciplined strategies can turn open enrollment from a confusing annual chore into a financially savvy exercise in protection and planning.

The Smart Buyer’s Checklist for Open Enrollment

As a healthcare advisor, I see families pay thousands more each year — not because they’re sicker, but because they’re on the wrong plan or using the right one the wrong way. That’s why a disciplined review during open enrollment can make all the difference.

1. Start with your health, not the brochure.

Good coverage begins with a realistic medical assessment. Match your expected needs like chronic conditions, medications, upcoming procedures to the details of each plan. Without that, you’re comparing numbers in a vacuum.

2. Read the fine print. Always.

Premiums are just the cover price. Deductibles, coinsurance, prescription tiers, and exclusions are where the real costs hide. A low premium with a high deductible can easily become a false economy if you end up using care.

3. Verify your doctors and hospitals every year.

Networks shift constantly. Just because your doctor accepted your plan last year doesn’t mean they still do. Check directly with your provider and confirm in writing.

4. Never leave a gap in coverage.

Even a single uninsured day can expose you to catastrophic financial risk. Think of coverage as a seatbelt: you don’t take it off just because the road looks smooth.

5. Question your broker’s incentives.

Some brokers are paid more for selling certain plans — or represent only a limited roster of insurers. Ask how they’re compensated. You deserve transparency when your health and money are on the line.

6. Focus on hospital coverage above all else.

The biggest exposure isn’t your annual checkup — it’s hospitalization. Confirm that your preferred hospitals, especially for emergencies or chronic care, are covered in-network. That’s where the biggest bills — and biggest risks — hide.

7. Be wary of “off-market” or non-ACA plans.

So-called “alternative” health plans may look attractive but often skip essential benefits like maternity, mental health, or preventive care. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

The ACA Subsidy Cliff Ahead

The enhanced subsidies that have kept ACA premiums within reach for millions are set to disappear at the end of 2025. Originally introduced under the American Rescue Plan as part of COVID-19 relief and later extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act, these expanded tax credits reduced the share of income people had to devote to benchmark plans and extended financial help to households above 400% of the federal poverty level. Analysts at Health System Tracker, among others, note that these subsidies reshaped affordability across the market, making coverage more accessible for both low-income and middle-income households.

Now, if Congress fails to extend the subsidies, the financial shock will be significant. Premiums after subsidies could climb by 50% to 75% or more depending on income, geography, and plan type. Out-of-pocket burdens would rise sharply as the government covers less of the cost, and millions are projected to drop coverage altogether.

The Bottom Line: Treat Open Enrollment as a Financial Strategy

Healthcare costs have become one of the largest and most unpredictable line items in the modern family budget — rivaling housing and education. Treating open enrollment as part of your broader financial plan isn’t optional anymore; it’s essential risk management.

Two-thirds of bankruptcies in America involve medical debt — a reminder that the right health plan isn’t a luxury; it’s protection. Choosing wisely during Open Enrollment 2025 is one of the most important financial decisions a family can make.

Approach open enrollment 2025 health insurance like a financial review: an opportunity to reassess, reduce exposure, and plan ahead. Because when healthcare and wealth intersect, the smartest move isn’t to react — it’s to prepare.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68e923586f9956ea44e704b9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-10 15:03:08.415143

There are at least 3 things wrong with the way we do it now:

1. Too many Michiganders cannot afford the rates DTE and Consumers charge. Too many Michiganders are forced to decide between paying their electric bill and buying groceries. Inflation was the big issue in the 2024 election. It still is and DTE’s and Consumers’ rates are going up at 2 and 3 times faster than other costs.

2. Residential rates are exploding because of unjustified speculative frenzy around AI and data centers. DTE and Consumers want residents to pay for new methane-burning plants to power these data centers without any financial commitments from the big tech companies. Runaway speculation on data centers also strains our ground water and the Great Lakes.

3. Michigan has the worst electric outages in the nation. It takes our utilities an average of 12 hours to recover from outages. Even with a guaranteed 10% return for shareholders, they have failed to make the necessary investments in our grid infrastructure. They just keep blaming the trees.

At the Sierra Club, our mission is to ENJOY and PROTECT the wild places on Earth. We can’t enjoy them if we can’t afford to visit them because we had to pay our utility bill or because we had to throw out a refrigerator of food after an outage. We can’t enjoy them if the new data center has dried up the wetlands next door.

We’re not protecting them if we allow utilities to blow past our commitments to 100% clean energy by 2040. Burning coal and methane is warming up the Great Lakes, making our fisheries even more susceptible to invasive species. Rising temperatures are driving wildfires, flooding, an increase in tornadoes and ice storms that are wreaking havoc on our parks and forests.

The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC), the regulatory agency that approves our utilities’ plans, is holding public hearings about what rules should be used in approving these plans. This is an opportunity for all of us, as members and supporters of the Sierra Club, to exercise our mission to enjoy and protect our wild places.

The money would be used to hire a firm to create a report on the subject.

A working group of Oklahoma researchers and utilities has been assembled to gather information ahead of the study. The OCC partnered with the Hamm Institute for American Energy and identified nuclear energy experts from the University of Oklahoma.

The participants are working as volunteers, said Mark Argenbright, director of the OCC’s public utility division. He said Enercon Services, which completed Michigan’s nuclear feasibility study, is among the potential companies eyed for the task.

The request comes as the agency reports funding challenges and staffing shortages.

“ We're unable to fill them because we cannot pay the salaries commensurate to draw people to these jobs,” Commissioner Todd Hiett said. “And so, we're already cutting and operating very thinly already, and maybe to the legislature, a couple hundred thousand dollars doesn't sound like much, but in our world, that's quite a bit.”

The agency could continue its information gathering without hiring a firm, though Argenbright said the product wouldn’t be as comprehensive.

“ We'll create a report regardless of how we deal with the consultant issue,” he said. “But it will be at a different level than it would be with a consultant, where we would have a much deeper dive and a broader range of information that would be able to bring to bear on the report.”

The agency could also use money pulled from its assessment fees of utility companies. Chairman Kim David said that the option would result in higher costs for Oklahoma utility customers.

“ I'd like to make a motion that we requested supplemental appropriation for the $125,000 for the report and put it back in their lap,” David said of the state legislature. “We have a lot of different people that have given a lot of time and effort and energy into this.”

In response to Hiett voicing support for completing a study that the state can one day use, Commissioner Brian Bingman said the OCC should continue its report without hiring a third-party firm.

“ I kind of disagree because I just don't think the legislature is serious about this,” he said.

These high-stakes dialogues, unfolding against a backdrop of escalating global demand and geopolitical tensions, aim to secure a stable and diversified supply of minerals essential for defense, advanced technology, and the burgeoning clean energy transition. The urgency of these conversations underscores a collective recognition that securing these foundational resources is paramount to national economic security and technological sovereignty.

The discussions center on establishing robust frameworks, including potential direct supply agreements and financial mechanisms like guaranteed minimum prices and production-linked tax credits, to enhance domestic stockpiling and production capabilities. As of October 10, 2025, the focus is sharpened by the ongoing regulatory review of a proposed merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American (LSE: AAL), a deal poised to create a global powerhouse in critical minerals, particularly copper. This strategic alignment could profoundly reshape the global critical minerals landscape, offering North America a stronger hand in a market increasingly dominated by a few key players.

Strategic Dialogues and a Shifting Global Landscape

Teck Resources' active participation in these strategic discussions highlights a concerted effort by Western nations to de-risk their critical mineral supply chains, particularly in light of increasing export restrictions from countries like China, which has historically held significant sway over the supply of several key minerals. The company has specifically put forth recommendations for a Canadian Strategic Metals Reserve, advocating for a comprehensive framework that includes floor-price agreements, production-linked tax credits, and federal procurement backing to support the domestic stockpiling of strategic materials such as germanium, antimony, and gallium. These minerals are vital for semiconductors, advanced defense applications, and 5G technology, making their secure supply a matter of national security.

A pivotal element influencing these ongoing discussions is the proposed ""merger of equals"" between Teck Resources and Anglo American. This ambitious plan seeks to forge a new ""global critical minerals champion,"" primarily focused on copper—a metal indispensable for the energy transition—along with other essential metals. The combined entity, tentatively named Anglo Teck Group, would be headquartered in Vancouver. This proposed consolidation is currently undergoing rigorous regulatory review by the Canadian government, which is meticulously assessing its alignment with Canada's critical minerals strategy, national security concerns, including economic security, and its potential to generate significant job creation and economic benefits within Canada. As part of their commitment, the companies have pledged approximately $4.5 billion in Canadian spending over five years, encompassing investments in critical minerals exploration, technological advancements, and upgrades to key facilities like Teck’s Trail smelter.

Teck's CEO, Jonathan Price, has been vocal about the company's potential to meet the germanium needs of North America, and even the entire G7 nations, signaling a clear strategic intent by Western countries to diversify and stabilize their critical mineral supply chains away from over-reliance on dominant suppliers. However, Price has also expressed concerns that Canada's allocated C$4 billion over eight years for critical mineral development falls short when compared to the annual investments made by countries like China. He argues for more ambitious, targeted government incentives and investments to bolster North American critical minerals capacity and streamline cumbersome regulatory processes, which he believes currently lag behind investments in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plants.

The urgency driving these strategic discussions is further underscored by the unprecedented and rapidly escalating global demand for critical minerals. This surge is predominantly fueled by the expansion of the technology sector and, more significantly, the accelerating global transition to renewable energy sources and a low-carbon economy. Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite are indispensable for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, with lithium demand alone projected to increase over 40 times its current levels by 2050 to meet net-zero emissions targets. Rare earth elements are crucial for wind turbines and EV motors, while copper remains the backbone of all electricity-related technologies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported robust growth in critical mineral demand in 2023, with projections indicating a nearly quadrupling of overall mineral demand for clean energy technologies by 2040. This escalating demand, coupled with the concentrated refining and processing in a few countries, elevates critical minerals to a paramount national economic and security interest, driving urgent efforts to secure and diversify supply chains.

Potential Winners and Losers in the Critical Minerals Race

The intensified focus on North American critical mineral supply chains, coupled with the proposed Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger, is poised to create a significant ripple effect across various industries, establishing clear winners and losers in the evolving global resource landscape. The primary beneficiaries are expected to be domestic mining companies, technology firms, and defense contractors who can secure reliable access to these essential materials.

Among the mining companies, MP Materials (NYSE: MP), North America's largest rare earths producer, stands to gain substantially. Operating the Mountain Pass mine in California, MP Materials is strategically integrating vertically to produce rare earth magnets domestically, a move bolstered by significant government funding and a supply agreement with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Similarly, USA Rare Earth (USAR), developing a vertically integrated domestic rare earth magnet supply chain, and Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE American: IDR), with its significant rare earth element exploration properties, are well-positioned. Companies like United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY), the sole antimony smelter in the U.S. and Mexico, and Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSEAmerican: TMQ), which has received direct U.S. government investment for its Alaskan copper and zinc projects, will also benefit from the drive for domestic supply. In Canada, Green Technology Metals (ASX: GT1), focusing on lithium projects in Ontario, is pursuing an integrated mine-to-chemical strategy for battery-grade lithium hydroxide, securing an offtake agreement with LG Energy Solution (KRX: 373220).

The proposed $50-53 billion merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American, which is now reported as agreed, is set to create a new mining giant, ""Anglo Teck,"" headquartered in Vancouver. This combined entity, poised to be among the top five global copper producers, will benefit from enhanced portfolio diversification, operational synergies estimated at $800 million in pre-tax annual savings, and increased scale, particularly in copper production. Their strategic focus on copper and other critical minerals positions ""Anglo Teck"" favorably to meet demand from renewable energy, EVs, and green technologies, further strengthening Teck's ongoing discussions with the U.S. and Canada for critical mineral supply. This mega-merger could also trigger further consolidation in the mining industry, making smaller players with valuable deposits attractive acquisition targets.

Conversely, companies heavily reliant on uninterrupted, low-cost critical mineral imports from China, without diversified supply chains, could face increased costs and supply disruptions due to tariffs, export restrictions, and geopolitical tensions. Major mining competitors in copper and zinc, such as BHP (ASX: BHP, NYSE: BHP), Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO, NYSE: RIO), and Glencore (LSE: GLEN), could face heightened competition from the newly formed ""Anglo Teck"" powerhouse. These companies, some of whom previously made bids for Teck, have missed a significant strategic opportunity, potentially forcing them to seek other growth avenues. Furthermore, smaller mining companies, while some may become acquisition targets, could struggle to compete with the sheer scale and financial prowess of the merged entity, particularly in securing capital or developing new large-scale projects.

Wider Significance and Geopolitical Chessboard

The strategic maneuvers by Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and the governments of the U.S. and Canada transcend mere corporate dealings; they represent a critical inflection point in global resource geopolitics. This event fits squarely into broader industry trends defined by the accelerating global energy transition, which demands unprecedented quantities of critical minerals for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and advanced technologies. The projected 400-600% increase in demand for rare earth elements and up to 4,000% for lithium and graphite in EV batteries over the coming decades underscores the profound shift occurring in industrial supply chains.

The ripple effects of securing critical mineral supply chains are vast, impacting competitors, partners, and the overall balance of global power. The geographic concentration of mineral extraction and, more critically, processing—with China holding near-total dominance in rare earth processing and significant shares in strategic battery minerals—has created market fragility and geopolitical leverage. This has spurred Western nations to pursue ""derisking"" strategies, reducing reliance on single dominant suppliers, and ""friendshoring,"" collaborating with trusted allies like Canada and Australia. For competitor nations lacking domestic reserves or processing, disruptions can lead to significant economic impacts, driving them to diversify or face substantial economic output reductions. Conversely, resource-rich developing nations gain increased strategic leverage, becoming key partners in building diversified supply chains.

In response to these trends, governments worldwide are actively developing sophisticated legal frameworks and policy instruments. The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act and the U.S. Critical Minerals Strategy, alongside initiatives like the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), aim to encourage domestic production, processing, research, and recycling, while fostering international cooperation. These policies often include investment incentives, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, and a growing emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards to ensure responsible and sustainable mining practices. The imposition of export controls by some mineral-rich nations, as seen with graphite, gallium, and germanium, further highlights the urgency of these policy shifts.

Historically, the current drive for critical mineral security echoes past instances of resource nationalism and strategic competition. The U.S. Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1939, enacted at the onset of World War II, and the Defense Production Act of 1950 during the Korean War, both recognized that low commercial reserves posed a direct threat to national security, underscoring a long-standing understanding of material importance for military readiness. The present geopolitical competition over critical minerals is often compared to the 20th-century struggles over oil and gas, now seen as foundational to the 21st-century economy. This era marks a return to state intervention in mineral markets, reversing decades of global economic integration and signifying a fundamental shift in international relations driven by wider geopolitical tensions.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Critical Minerals

The strategic discussions involving Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and the proposed Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger signify a pivotal moment for the future of critical mineral supply chains in North America. In the short term, the focus will remain on solidifying government initiatives and funding, such as the U.S. Defense Production Act and Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, to accelerate domestic mining, processing, and recycling. Efforts to streamline the notoriously lengthy permitting processes for new mines will be crucial, alongside the establishment of strategic mineral reserves to buffer against immediate supply shocks. The ""friendshoring"" approach, strengthening alliances with trusted partners like Australia, will continue to be a key strategy to diversify supply.

Looking long-term, the vision is to cultivate a robust, sustainable, and self-reliant critical mineral ecosystem across North America. This necessitates building an integrated value chain, from upstream exploration and extraction to midstream processing and refining, which currently remains a significant weak point. A comprehensive circular economy model, encompassing responsible mining, advanced recycling, and urban mining, will be essential for long-term sustainability and reduced environmental impact. Investment in technological innovation, such as deep-sea mineral exploration and alternative materials research, coupled with critical workforce development, will underpin this strategic pivot. The ultimate goal is a fundamental geopolitical rebalancing, reducing reliance on dominant suppliers and establishing new processing hubs within allied nations, a process that will require sustained collaboration over decades.

The market opportunities emerging from this shift are immense, driven by the projected six-fold increase in the energy sector's mineral needs by 2040 and the booming electric vehicle market. This creates significant economic growth and job creation potential across North America, attracting a surge in investment, particularly for projects that qualify for government support. However, formidable challenges persist, including North America's continued heavy reliance on external suppliers for processing, the long lead times and high costs associated with developing new mines, and persistent regulatory and environmental hurdles. Workforce shortages in mining engineering also present a critical bottleneck. The agreed-upon merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American, set to create the ""Anglo Teck"" entity headquartered in Vancouver, is a significant scenario that could accelerate project development and enhance supply chain security, particularly for copper and other critical minerals, aligning with governmental security objectives. However, it will undoubtedly face rigorous regulatory scrutiny to ensure it provides a net benefit to Canada and does not raise undue market concentration concerns.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Securing the Future

The strategic discussions led by Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) with the U.S. and Canadian governments, culminating in the proposed Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger, mark a defining moment in North America's quest for critical mineral security. Key takeaways from these developments underscore a clear and urgent shift towards diversifying supply chains away from concentrated foreign sources, particularly China, to safeguard national economic and defense interests. The escalating global demand for critical minerals, driven by the clean energy transition and advanced technologies, has elevated these resources to a geopolitical imperative, reminiscent of historical struggles for vital raw materials.

Moving forward, the market for critical minerals is set to experience unprecedented growth and transformation. The formation of ""Anglo Teck"" promises a new global powerhouse, particularly in copper, which will significantly bolster North American supply capabilities. However, the path to self-sufficiency is fraught with challenges, including the need for substantial investment in domestic processing infrastructure, streamlined regulatory processes, and a skilled workforce. The emphasis on sustainable and ESG-compliant mining practices will also differentiate North American producers and shape future investment decisions.

The lasting impact of these events will be a more resilient, albeit potentially more expensive, critical mineral supply chain for North America and its allies. This strategic realignment aims to reduce vulnerability to geopolitical disruptions and ensure consistent access to materials vital for future economic growth and technological innovation. Investors should closely monitor regulatory approvals for the Anglo Teck merger, progress on government funding initiatives for critical mineral projects, and the development of new extraction and processing technologies. The long-term success of this strategic pivot will hinge on sustained collaboration between governments and industry, fostering a robust and integrated North American critical minerals ecosystem that can withstand future global shocks.

These pensions are some of the biggest investors in the country, so where they invest matters. Right now, they're using our money to fund Big Oil, other polluters, and greenwashed “climate solutions” that don’t actually cut pollution. That means workers’ hard-earned savings are being used to prop up the industries driving the climate crisis, instead of protecting their future.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Pensions could be part of the solution, investing in ways that secure workers’ retirements and support a safe, livable planet.

That's why the Sierra Club is calling on public pensions to adopt our Climate Solutions Investment Principles — commonsense guidelines that direct money into real climate solutions like clean energy, good union jobs, and resilient communities.

Take action: Add your name now to demand that public pensions invest in a livable future. (If you are a public pension member, please include that in your personal message!)

We are already facing (and paying for) the impacts of climate change. Not only do we face threats to our homes from storms and flooding, but rising temperatures are raising the cost of food, utility bills, and more.

There’s a growing body of research that shows climate change isn’t just an environmental threat, it’s a financial one. The projected financial impacts of the climate crisis means upending the economy and devaluing investments, directly threatening workers' retirement savings. The long-term security of our retirement savings depends on the stability of the economy, which in turn depends on the health of the environmental and social systems that underpin it. To safeguard our ability to retire, we need to decarbonize our economy, and that requires making investments in clean energy and other climate solutions.

Investing in clean, renewable energy isn't just the right thing to do for our planet. It also makes financial sense.

Pensions have a fiduciary duty not only to avoid losses from climate risks, but also to seek out investment opportunities. Credible climate solutions can deliver stable, long-term returns that protect workers’ retirement savings in the long run.

Without redirecting capital toward things like clean energy technologies, green manufacturing, and zero-emissions transportation, pensions risk underinvesting in the energy transition and missing out on the growth that the clean energy economy will generate for decades to come.

Right now, we're seeing the Trump administration roll back 50 years worth of environmental protections. We can and must fight back in every way possible, and that includes investing our tax dollars and our retirement savings in ways that protect the planet and our retirement portfolios

Together, they are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant long-term economic benefits for the Rio Grande Valley.","BROWNSVILLE, Texas - At the southernmost point of Texas, where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf, the Port of Brownsville is driving a new era of growth and opportunity. Vessels, trains, and trucks traverse the port’s industrial landscape, signaling more than just cargo in motion. This is the economic engine driving the Rio Grande Valley’s economy.

As the only deepwater seaport located on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Port of Brownsville has become a gateway for trade, a magnet for investment, and a catalyst for opportunity across South Texas. Currently, more than $20 billion in projects are in the pipeline, promising to further transform the economic landscape of South Texas.

The port’s long-term vision is guided by the Brownsville Navigation District Board of Commissioners. This five-member elected body oversees policy, planning, and major investment decisions. The current board includes Chairman Esteban Guerra, Vice Chairman Sergio Tito Lopez, Secretary John Reed, and Assistant Secretaries John Wood and Ernesto Gutierrez. Together, their leadership reflects a strong commitment to economic growth, public trust, and regional impact.

The Port of Brownsville continues to play a central role in the success of the region. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the port climbed to No. 41 among the nation’s 150 maritime ports for waterborne cargo, its highest ranking to date. In 2023, the port moved 11.2 million tons of waterborne cargo, up from 9.1 million tons in 2022.

That momentum carried throughout 2024, with total cargo reaching 28 million tons marking a 57 percent increase from 2023. Operating revenue at the port in 2024 surpassed $30 million for the fourth consecutive year, reaching $43.3 million.

This growth represents more than statistics. It means jobs for families, new business, and broader momentum across South Texas. Every ton of cargo supports a ripple effect that fuels the local economy.

Contributing to the port’s success are consistent investments in infrastructure. A centerpiece of that effort is the Brazos Island Harbor Channel Improvement Project, which will deepen the 17-mile-long ship channel from 42 feet to 52 feet. The increased depth will allow larger vessels to enter more safely, reduce wait times, and improve overall efficiency.

The project is divided into two phases. It’s backed by a Public-Private Partnership involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of Brownsville, and energy company NextDecade. In 2019, NextDecade committed to funding Phase 1, a $400 million investment, which includes deepening the channel near its Rio Grande LNG site and building two ship berths and a turning basin. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company received the contract from NextDecade for work on Phase 1. Phase 2, led by the port and the Corps, is supported by $68 million in federal funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In 2024, a $104 million contract was awarded to Callan Marine Ltd. The estimated completion date of the project is late 2026.

Infrastructure improvements on the port’s land are moving just as quickly. The port has expanded laydown yards, modernized roadways, and improved berths to handle high-volume cargo, including wind energy components. These updates are essential for maintaining the port’s competitiveness in a changing global market.

The Port of Brownsville continues to attract some of the largest private investments in the energy sector. Projects like Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG are shaping the future of U.S. energy exports. Together, they are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant long-term economic benefits for the Rio Grande Valley.

Rio Grande LNG, built by Bechtel Energy Inc., is a natural gas liquefaction and export facility with up to 48 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of potential capacity, making it one of the world’s largest LNG projects in development. Trains 1 through 4, representing about 24 MTPA and $25 billion in investment, are under construction and scheduled to begin operations between 2027 and 2030, supported by customers such as ADNOC, Aramco, Shell, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies. Train 5, with commercial agreements secured from Jera, EQT, and ConocoPhillips, is advancing toward a positive Final Investment Decision, while Trains 6 through 8 are in early development and permitting.

Texas LNG, a project of Glenfarne Energy Transition, is a planned 4 MTPA export terminal at the Port of Brownsville designed to be one of the lowest-emission LNG facilities in the world. It has secured offtake agreements with companies including EQT Corporation, Gunvor Group, Macquarie, and a major European utility. Texas LNG recently cleared a key regulatory milestone with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and is targeting a Final Investment Decision by the end of 2025. Kiewit Corporation has been selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, with the project expected to be completed by 2029.

The port is also prioritizing sustainability. From habitat restoration projects to native species conservation, it is working to ensure that economic development goes hand-in-hand with environmental responsibility. These efforts help maintain a balance between progress and preservation.

The port’s location and multimodal access position as a unique link between global trade and emerging industries. It plays a growing role in renewable energy logistics, particularly in the transport of oversized equipment like wind turbines. It’s also supporting the commercial space industry. Just a short distance from SpaceX’s Starbase launch site, the port offers specialized logistics that support space innovation and advanced manufacturing.

With competitive costs, unmatched logistics, available land, and a growing labor force, the Port Brownsville is one of the most attractive locations in the country for nearshoring and industrial investment.

EPA Plans to Redefine a Key Air Permitting Threshold,Not Available,,,,,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/when-does-construction-really-begin-epa-5543176/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to propose, by 2026, a rule revising the definition of “begin actual construction” under the Clean Air Act’s (CAA) New Source Review (NSR) regulations.
How the EPA Has Interpreted “Begin Actual Construction” Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source may not “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.
The EPA concluded that these actions do not constitute “beginning actual construction,” provided that no emissions units or related components are installed.
Implications for Project Planning and Risk The EPA’s evolving interpretation of “begin actual construction” may provide meaningful flexibility for project developers navigating lengthy NSR reviews.
Even modest adjustments to the NSR “begin construction” threshold could materially affect project timing, costs, and compliance strategies in an era of accelerating energy demand and capital-intensive infrastructure development.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to propose, by 2026, a rule revising the definition of “begin actual construction” under the Clean Air Act’s (CAA) New Source Review (NSR) regulations. This threshold determines when a new or modified major stationary source must obtain an NSR permit before starting construction—a distinction with major implications for project sequencing, financing, and regulatory risk.

The EPA’s announcement comes at a critical time for U.S. energy and industrial policy. National electricity demand is projected to rise sharply over the next five years, driven by growth in AI data centers and widespread electrification. The International Energy Agency estimates that data centers alone will account for nearly half of the nation’s total increase in electricity demand through 2030—and, within five years, consume more power than all U.S. production of aluminum, steel, cement, and chemicals combined. In this context, the EPA’s reinterpretation of when “construction” truly begins could have favorable implications for energy and industrial developments nationwide.

How the EPA Has Interpreted “Begin Actual Construction”

Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source may not “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.[1] The EPA regulations define this term as “the initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature,” including activities such as installing building supports and foundations, laying underground piping, or constructing permanent storage structures.[2]

Historically, the EPA interpreted this provision broadly. In a March 28, 1986, memorandum from Edward Reich (the “Reich Memo”), the agency concluded that construction of structures intended to accommodate emissions units could itself constitute “actual construction,” even if no emissions equipment had yet been installed.[3] For decades, the regulated community treated this as effectively prohibiting most preparatory construction until an NSR permit was issued, a view reinforced in subsequent memoranda and guidance letters.[4]

In March 2020, however, the EPA under the first Trump administration issued draft guidance that adopted a less restrictive approach.[5] The March 2020 Draft Guidance clarified that:

Source owners or operators may undertake physical on-site activities prior to obtaining an NSR permit—including activities that may be costly, significantly alter the site, or are permanent in nature—provided those activities do not constitute physical construction on an emissions unit, as defined in 40 CFR § 52.21(b)(7).

In contrast to the 1986 Reich Memorandum, an “installation necessary to accommodate” the emissions unit is not considered part of that emissions unit, meaning construction activities involving such accommodations may occur before an NSR permit is obtained.

In short, NSR obligations are triggered only by direct work on emissions units, not by general building or site preparation. The EPA emphasized that any on-site construction undertaken prior to obtaining an NSR permit remains “at risk”—meaning that if a permit is later denied or additional controls are required, developers may face costly redesigns or delays.

The EPA’s 2025 Maricopa County Semiconductor Decision

In September 2025, the EPA reaffirmed this narrower interpretation in response to a request from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department regarding a proposed semiconductor manufacturing complex.[6] The developer sought to construct the building’s “core and shell”—including the foundation, steel frame, and exterior walls—before obtaining an NSR permit, while deferring installation of emissions units, related foundations, and piping until after permit approval.

The EPA concluded that these actions do not constitute “beginning actual construction,” provided that no emissions units or related components are installed. The agency clarified that the term applies specifically to on-site construction of emissions units, not other parts of a facility. The EPA also noted that the 1986 Reich Memo reflected an “overly broad” interpretation by treating structures accommodating emissions units as part of the units themselves.

Although the Maricopa County decision responds to project-specific facts, it aligns with the March 2020 Draft Guidance. The EPA confirmed that it does not plan to finalize the 2020 guidance; instead, the agency intends to initiate a formal rulemaking to revise the NSR program’s definition of “begin actual construction” consistent with this narrower approach. This rulemaking is included in the EPA’s 2025 Spring Agenda, with a proposed rule expected by January 2026 and a final rule targeted for September 2026.

Implications for Project Planning and Risk

The EPA’s evolving interpretation of “begin actual construction” may provide meaningful flexibility for project developers navigating lengthy NSR reviews. A clarified, narrower definition could allow certain preparatory site and building activities to proceed without triggering NSR requirements. However, the EPA has stressed that any such activities remain “at risk.”

Developers in Texas should also consider recent state-level changes. In 2019, the Texas Legislature amended the Texas Clean Air Act through House Bill 2726 (codified at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 382.004), authorizing limited “construction at risk.” Under this law, applicants for a permit amendment may begin construction once the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issues a draft permit, rather than waiting for final issuance. The statute requires compliance with federal law and specifies that all work proceeds at the applicant’s own risk. If the EPA finalizes its narrower definition of “begin actual construction,” TCEQ’s permitting approach may adjust accordingly, potentially broadening the range of activities it may approve before final permit issuance.

Looking ahead, the EPA’s forthcoming rule is expected to clarify when NSR preconstruction obligations attach and align federal policy with practical construction sequencing. The outcome will be closely watched by developers, permitting authorities, and environmental advocates. Even modest adjustments to the NSR “begin construction” threshold could materially affect project timing, costs, and compliance strategies in an era of accelerating energy demand and capital-intensive infrastructure development.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases have ended, but state-level programs still offer relief to some buyers. Depending on where you live, you might still qualify for thousands in state tax breaks. However, you could also pay higher registration fees than your gasoline-driving neighbors.

The change highlights a major transition in U.S. transportation policy. States are trying to balance environmental goals with the need to fund roads and bridges.

Federal Credits End as Congress Pulls Plug

Congress ended the Biden-era EV tax credits on Sept. 30. Those credits offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. The end of the federal program caused a surge in last-minute EV purchases as consumers rushed to beat the deadline. Analysts now predict a temporary dip in nationwide EV sales.

Still, several states — including Colorado, California, and New Jersey — continue offering rebates or tax incentives to maintain sales momentum.

Balancing Incentives with New Fees

The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, notes that state EV policies often conflict. While incentives encourage electric adoption, other laws impose higher registration or “road use” fees. States justify these costs because EV owners do not pay gasoline taxes, which fund most transportation infrastructure.

Oklahoma drivers, for example, pay an annual EV fee of $110 on top of registration costs. Lawmakers say that keeps road funding balanced while encouraging responsible electric growth.

The Bigger Picture — Infrastructure and Fairness

As EV adoption grows, states face pressure to replace lost fuel-tax revenue. The transition requires creative policy solutions that reward clean energy without draining highway funds. Many transportation experts predict more states will adopt mileage-based user fees within the next decade.

The debate reflects a crossroads for America’s energy and transportation policy — one where sustainability and fiscal responsibility must meet in the middle.",,N,,2025-10-10 13:06:12.510549

Both Ford and General Motors had ideas about how to offer a slight extension to folks, but both companies have officially nixed those plans; GM called it off on Wednesday this week, and Reuters reports that Ford just eliminated its offer on Friday, October 10.

GM told Reuters that, ""after further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit.” A Ford spokesperson said, “Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today.”

The two companies originally came up with a creative idea to work around the demise of the tax credit, at least for those vehicles still on the lot today: both the Ford and GM in-house lending arms were planning to initiate the purchase of EVs in inventory while the credit was still applicable, and then pass those savings onto the customers who would ultimately lease the vehicles.

Pushback came from the Republican U.S. senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio. Moreno and fellow senator John Barrasso (R-MD) wrote a public letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concerning the matter.

“It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal down payment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months,” the senators wrote. “Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors.”

After GM pulled back from the program, Moreno expressed his happiness in an interview with Reuters.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a more consensus-minded society like Sweden, or top-down authoritarianism like China. Governments pick winners and losers. In America, those losers are anyone in the EV supply chain.

There’s a new article out that talks about the ‘Battery Belt,’ which is a useful neologism for the mostly rural and historically Republican areas that were supposed to be the source of batteries for future electric cars. That’s not happening at the speed most predicted, so what happens to those communities?

The Morning Dump is a news roundup, and all the news today is built around batteries. We know what’s happening, but who is to blame?

Is it the automakers who had too lofty ambitions? Is it the politicians who halted an industrial policy before it could be started? And where does this go?

‘That’s On Everybody’s Mind, Quite Frankly’

Back in 2022, Ford announced it would spend billions building a battery and EV truck-making facility in Stanton, Tennessee. This small town of 450 people would suddenly get thousands of new workers.

This facility was to be a part of the Battery Belt and, maybe, still will be. Ford keeps delaying the project, just like nearly every major automaker with EV ambitions in the United States.

What if it never happens? From the Reuters piece on the dashed dreams of the Battery Belt, that’s the question:

The uncertain fate of these massive, high-tech factories and their employment has rattled the small rural communities that spent years hitching their economic futures to these projects.

“That’s on everybody’s mind, quite frankly,” said Allan Sterbinsky, who retired as mayor of Stanton in December and advocated for the site for years before Ford came to town. Some residents worry that Ford will never follow through on the plant, the former mayor says. Others hope the company will repurpose the 3,600-acre site if demand doesn’t increase for EVs.

A Ford spokesperson pointed to the automaker’s community work in Stanton, including grants to public safety organizations as part of a broader $9 million commitment to the area.

Essentially, the industry was preparing to build enough battery capacity to cover roughly 80% of the current car market, or around 13 million cars. Now? Maybe a quarter of that will be necessary.

What happens to these communities? How did we end up here?

‘Electric Vehicle Subsidies Were… Distorting The Market’

I have already written at length here about how electric vehicle subsidies were, ultimately, bad politics, even if you think they were good governance.

Ford and General Motors thought they’d be clever and use a loophole in the IRS guidance around the ending of the IRA tax credit to extend it for a few months. Both GM and Ford have bailed on those plans after two Republican Senators cried foul.

Here’s the letter from the Senators that explains some of their reasoning:

We write to alert you to a serious violation of Congressional intent that threatens great harm to U.S. taxpayer dollars and ask for your immediate assistance in rectifying this problem.

As you know, Congress recently enacted Public Law 119-21, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, giving working class families massive tax relief, ending the Green New Scam, and fully funding our border security and national security needs. As part of this law, Congress amended Sections 25E, 30D, and 45W of the tax code, which collectively provide tax credits for the purchase of certain “clean vehicles.” These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off.

Senator Moreno is a car dealer, so you might expect he’d have some sort of sympathy for dealers or automakers who are now trying to move these vehicles (that the previous government pushed).

I think the bit about how these subsidies were “distorting the market for automakers” kind of gives the game away. A 2023 report from Climate Power showed that there were 24 planned battery projects and 11 electric vehicle projects in rural areas, representing more than $20 billion in investments. Because it’s hard to build plants in urban areas, it’s not surprising that most of these plans were in Republican districts. They are in a mix of historically swing and not-so swing Republican states, however.

The political ramifications of potentially killing many of these projects seem, from the Republican side at least, not to be as big of a deal as continuing the tax credit.

‘It’s Going To Be Smaller, Way Smaller Than We Thought’

Credit to Ford CEO Jim Farley for having a quote for every topic. While recently expanding on his belief that we need more skilled tradespeople (we do), he also made a point of being honest about how expectations for EV adoption were not matched to the reality of consumer demand.

Per CNBC:

Farley on Tuesday said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% this month — which is expected to be a record — to 5% after the incentive program ends.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said during a Ford event about promoting skilled trades and workers in Detroit. “We’re going to find out in a month. I wouldn’t be surprised that the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%.”

Farley said the industry learned that “partial electrification,” such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept for the time being.

Even if the Democrats won every seat in every election and the White House, it’s not like all that battery capacity we were building would have exactly been necessary (some plans were being paused before the election). We’d have ended up somewhere in between, or at least closer to in between than where we are now.

Either way, the post-Tesla overheated projections definitely contributed to this mess.

‘It’s Not Something (We), In Any Way, Shape, Or Form, Expect To Give Up’

Could General Motors do the one thing it doesn’t normally do? Could GM be right on the technology and ahead of the market, and not suddenly retreat at the first sign of an obstacle?

Here’s a quote from a Detroit Free Press interview with GM President of North America Duncan Alred:

Still, GM invested significant money and planning to offer the range of EVs it has today. Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM’s leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

“We believe EVs will remain a strong part of the GM portfolio. Quite honestly, it’s one of the reasons why our market share has grown so much this year,” Aldred said. “It’s not something (we), in any way, shape or form, expect to give up.”

Year to date, GM estimates that its 17.2% market share across vehicle propulsion systems is the highest it’s been in 10 years. So far this year, EV total sales more than doubled to 144,668 vehicles.

Cool? Cool! GM is already deeply invested in its EV project and has approximately a dozen models out there, compared to just three for Ford. It also has affordable vehicles like the reborn Bolt coming to the market.

EVs are the right car for a lot of people, including consumers who haven’t been able to afford one yet.

If everyone else (other than Tesla) is retreating to some degree, it’s maybe not the worst position for GM to be in to soak up all that excess market share.

GM never received the federal funding and will work with the DOE and Piston to determine next steps on closing out the programs, Fowle said.
GM's retrenchment follows Stellantis' cancellation of hydrogen fuel cell development efforts, announced this summer.
Automakers including GM, Stellantis and Toyota invested substantially in hydrogen as a viable propulsion technology, especially for heavy-duty vehicles.
""High costs and limited hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S. has limited consumer adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles.""","Crain’s confirmed with GM that its project with Southfield-based Piston Automotive, which was to create more than 140 jobs at the former Michigan State Fairgrounds site in Detroit, would be scrapped. Crain's first reported in May that the project was paused due to regulatory uncertainty.

GM spokesman Stuart Fowle said policy changes and the automaker's reassessment of its portfolio triggered the decision. The lack of hydrogen infrastructure and longer-than-expected transition to electric vehicles are key reasons for the shift.

""Certainly the decisions of the DOE are an element of that overall climate but not the only driver,"" Fowle said. ""We want to prioritize the engineering talent and resources and everything we have to continuing to advance EVs given hydrogen is in a different spot.""

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded GM $30 million in grants for its hydrogen fuel cell programs in March 2024 as part of $750 million in total funding for 52 projects around the country. The DOE announced last week it would terminate 321 financial awards worth $7.56 billion, but did not specify the projects.

GM never received the federal funding and will work with the DOE and Piston to determine next steps on closing out the programs, Fowle said. ""Today we shared the news with employees. Next step is discussions with external stakeholders,"" he said.

GM's retrenchment follows Stellantis' cancellation of hydrogen fuel cell development efforts, announced this summer. Automakers including GM, Stellantis and Toyota invested substantially in hydrogen as a viable propulsion technology, especially for heavy-duty vehicles. But the timeline for market traction and return on investment has repeatedly been pushed out.

""While hydrogen holds promise for specific high-demand industrial applications like backup power, mining, and heavy trucking, the path to reaching a sustainable business in fuel cells is long and uncertain,"" GM said in a statement posted on its website. ""High costs and limited hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S. has limited consumer adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles.""

Crain's first reported a year ago about the GM-Piston project in Detroit. The 292,550-square-foot building along Eight Mile Road was expected to serve as the automaker's first standalone hydrogen plant.

GM said it will ""work with Piston to determine another use for the facility.""

This isn’t the first obstacle the Park Service has endured under Trump’s second term.
National parks have warmed at double the rate of the rest of the country, according to research from Patrick Gonzalez, formerly the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service.","This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

This summer, national park employees and visitors were asked to do something highly unusual: report any signs that failed to make America look great. The effort, stemming from an executive order from President Donald Trump, has already resulted in the removal of signs about the horrors of slavery, massacres of Indigenous peoples, and the threat of climate change, even on lands directly in harm’s way.

Consider Acadia National Park in Maine. More intense storms and rising seas are accelerating erosion and killing native plants along its iconic coastline. Warmer temperatures are assisting the spread of an invasive insect that totally wiped out the park’s red pines. And yet last month, park employees removed multiple signs explaining how climate change was contributing to these changes.

“Getting access to that information when you’re right there is a way to see with your own eyes what is going on,” said Chellie Pingree, a Democratic representative from Maine. The removed signs didn’t just educate visitors about environmental problems — they also outlined steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions, such as taking a shuttle bus instead of a personal vehicle to visit popular park sites.

Trump’s executive order in March directed the Interior Department to remove descriptions that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living” and focus instead on “the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.” The directive also demanded an emphasis on “the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.” Even items at national park gift shops were subject to review.

This isn’t the first obstacle the Park Service has endured under Trump’s second term. Due to federal cuts, the National Park Service has lost a quarter of its permanent staff, many of whom worked to preserve species and natural features in the parks over the long term. Employees at Acadia are stretched very thin, with more than 60 vacant year-round staff positions, according to Todd Martin, senior program manager for the Northeast for the National Parks Conservation Association. The administration has also proposed cutting the Park Service’s budget for 2026 by $1.2 billion.

Gutting those resources, particularly at a time when climate change is altering national parks, means that the very beauty Trump wants to highlight is at risk of disappearing.

National parks have warmed at double the rate of the rest of the country, according to research from Patrick Gonzalez, formerly the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service. “More severe heating occurs in national parks because extensive areas of the national park system are located in extreme environments — in the Arctic, at high elevations, and in the arid Southwest,” he said.

Some of the parks’ namesake features could be lost: the glaciers of Montana’s Glacier National Park could vanish within decades, the Joshua trees could eventually disappear at California’s Joshua Tree National Park, and more severe wildfires have already taken out a fifth of California’s famous sequoias. Warming temperatures could hurt Yellowstone National Park’s bison population, and sea level rise is reducing habitat for the Florida panther in the Everglades.

“We as a country worry about losing these spectacular resources, and people want to know what the Park Service is doing to keep them alive and to make sure they survive past this generation,” said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association. “Hiding this information from the public is just not what the Park Service is about.”

Some signs explaining environmental threats came out of the Park Service’s climate change response strategy created under President Barack Obama in 2010, which placed a focus on communicating the risks of global warming — and what could be done about it — to the public. The interpretive signs were carefully vetted by scientists and other experts to ensure they were accurate before they went up, according to Gonzalez.

It’s unclear how many of these signs will be removed as a result of Trump’s executive order, but many have been brought to the administration’s attention. Park officials at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, flagged a plaque explaining how fossil fuels cause air pollution that harms plants and animals. At Everglades National Park, an employee noted that signs about farming and urban development damaging the land “could be conceived as being disparaging to the development of industrial America.” Meanwhile, at Cape Hatteras National Seashore on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, an employee wondered if a sign about sea level rise threatening the Ocracoke ponies’ habitat “reduces the focus on grandeur, beauty, and abundance.”

Other environmental information has already disappeared from park signs. In July, Muir Woods National Monument in Northern California removed its “history under construction” exhibit that had added historical and cultural context to its existing signage. The new information had included explanations of how the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo peoples maintained the land for centuries through cultural burns, as well as informing visitors that the conservationist Gifford Pinchot, who worked to preserve Muir Woods, also promoted eugenics.

Park Service staff have told Brengel that being asked to report and censor their own signs has been a morale killer. “They’re devastated,” she said. She’s heard that some parks have been told not to remove any more signs because of “bad publicity,” but also that many parks west of the Mississippi have been told to keep flagging signs to comply with the directive.

“This is not over,” Brengel said. “They’re planning to censor more parks. It’s just a matter of time at this point.”

None of the national parks Grist contacted commented on the environment-related signs that were removed or flagged for review, deferring to the Department of Interior or the National Park Service. (National parks employees have been told not to talk to journalists, sources told Grist.)

“Thanks to President Donald Trump, Interior is ensuring that the American people are no longer being fed the lies of the delusional Green New Scam,” said Aubrie Spady, the Interior’s deputy press secretary, in a statement. “The content was taken down because this administration believes in only administering facts based on real science to the American public, not brainless fear-mongering rhetoric used to steal taxpayer dollars.”

Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the National Park Service, put it a more neutral way: “The president has directed federal agencies to review interpretive materials to ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values.”

The sign removals are part of a larger pattern to hide information about climate change from public view. In his second term, Trump has launched an assault on climate science, deleting landmark climate reports, slashing funding for climate research, and ending a program that tracked the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Language about the changing climate has vanished from federal websites, including entire pages about it on the Park Service website.

In response, scientists, academics, and other volunteers have worked to save the data that’s being lost and try to make it available for the public to find again.

The erasure of “negative” stories at national parks has spurred another such initiative, called “Save Our Signs.” The goal is to crowdsource photos of signs from National Park Service sites all around the country to create a publicly accessible collection. So far, Save Our Signs has received more than 10,000 photos from hundreds of sites, said Jenny McBurney, a government publications librarian who helped start the project.

Politicians are also pushing back. Last week, Pingree and dozens of representatives signed a letter to National Park Service director Jessica Bowron condemning the removal of historical signs and asking for detailed information on all the signs that had been flagged for violations, altered, or removed.

McBurney said that the Save Our Signs project is still accepting photos, even though it’s already seen an outpouring of support. “You can just tell that people really care about our parks, and they want to make sure that this important information is preserved.”",https://dxu6k2kio89d8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07133340/Acadia-climate-change-sign-NPS-Jay-Elhard-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:22.455382

The site features more than half a million board feet of southern yellow pine in walls and ceilings, lower‑carbon concrete, generous daylighting and over 170 EV charging stalls, all intended to test which sustainability measures can scale across Amazon’s global portfolio.

“We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,” said Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s vice president of global realty. “DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas, not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them,” Mallory said. Amazon will treat the site as an operational testbed, gathering the complex data needed to decide which materials and systems merit wider rollout.

Wood Central understands that timber is DII5’s defining feature. Mass timber — engineered by laminating standard softwood into large panels and beams — delivers structural performance comparable to concrete and steel while dramatically reducing embodied carbon and storing atmospheric CO₂ in long‑lived building elements.

Kristen Dotson, Amazon’s principal for sustainable buildings, said locking carbon into timber for 50 to 100 years creates a tangible carbon “bank,” preventing that CO₂ from returning to the atmosphere and materially lowering a building’s lifecycle emissions. “The game‑changing part around mass timber is that it’s taking a ready commodity and turning it into this structural element that can replace much of the concrete and steel that goes into a building,” Dotson said.

DII5 pairs its timber structure with proven performance systems: heat pumps, clerestory daylighting and LED controls to cut operational energy; a 15,000‑gallon rainwater capture and filtration system for toilet reuse; and more than 170 EV chargers supporting roughly 125 electric delivery vehicles already on site. Local fabricators supplied and finished the timber components, and lower‑carbon concrete technologies were used where concrete remained necessary.

Marty Brennan, design architect and sustainability lead at ZGF, described DII5 as both a design and supply‑chain experiment. “The scheme brings together numerous partners from across the building industry to create a welcoming experience of light, wood, and native prairies,” he said, reflecting an intent to pair environmental performance with material and spatial quality.

Amazon will judge DII5 against measurable outcomes: construction impacts, lifecycle carbon, cost, fire performance, durability and constructability.

The region has lagged behind the rest of the world in the adoption of the renewable energy sector, and this new development fosters international cooperation that could catapult green hydrogen into the global energy conversation. The new report comes to us from H2-diplo and is called the “Green Hydrogen and Regional Cooperation in Central Asia” study. It aims to develop green hydrogen possibilities for nations in Central Asia.

The report highlights the role that green hydrogen could play in transforming the energy sector in Central Asia

The world has embraced the potential that the green hydrogen sector has in troves and has implemented measures to develop the technology enabling us to finally make use of green hydrogen in the energy sector.

Despite Central Asia’s untapped wind and solar potential, renewable energy accounts for 2% of energy generation in the region as of 2022. Green hydrogen could alter that percentage significantly, as the report states.

Despite the overwhelming global narrative that has emerged recently, calling for a more practical approach to the hydrogen sector, most nations in Central Asia have not been able to take advantage of the new approach to the energy sector. The report calls for significant investments from international bodies that could foster growth for the hydrogen sector in the region.

Kazakhstan recently hosted the second Central Asian Regional Forum on Decarbonization Diplomacy

Kazakhstan is the Central Asian nation leading the push to integrate the hydrogen sector into its plans for the future of the energy sector. The event in Astana saw more than 150 participants from the government, international organizations, business, academia, and civil society.

Among the topics discussed at the Central Asian Regional Forum on Decarbonization Diplomacy were:

National hydrogen roadmaps

renewable grid integration

inclusivity and investment conditions

Regional certification for a trusted hydrogen market

Exemplifying international cooperation is key to the Central Asian region, as proven by the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Kazakh Ministry of Energy and the German Hydrogen Diplomacy Office, which happened at the event. Green hydrogen has come exceedingly far in a very short time frame as certain European nations aim to boost aid for green hydrogen and ammonia-powered ships.

Among the high-level government attendees was none other than Kazakhstan Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Issetov, who delivered the opening address.

“This gathering comes at a crucial time across the globe. The energy transition is no longer a distant vision for Central Asia. This transition is not just about reducing emissions. It is about economic resilience, regional stability and global relevance. When we talk about energy transition, a key question arises: who will drive this process? It is about people ready to bring the green strategy to life. (…) We believe that we have to invest in our human capital” – Kazakhstan Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Issetov

He also noted that by fostering regional cooperation in training and research, Central Asia has the potential to dominate the hydrogen sector for the foreseeable future.

Multiple species of great whales—North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and minke whales—are currently experiencing unusual mortality events off the East Coast.
But again, there is no evidence that offshore wind development is the cause.
Offshore wind development is a critical component of mitigating climate change, and responsible offshore wind development enjoys broad support from coastal communities and environmental organizations.","Federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths. In fact, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Fisheries, the agency responsible for marine mammal conservation and management, explains in its FAQ on offshore wind and whales: “There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.” Earlier this year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office similarly reported that NOAA Fisheries “does not anticipate any death or serious injury to whales from offshore wind related actions.” And the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)—the agency responsible for siting and permitting offshore wind projects—stated in 2024 that “[a]ll current evidence indicates that there are no links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, including site characterization surveys.”

Independent scientists have likewise found “no evidence” that offshore wind development resulted in whale deaths or strandings (when a whale is found onshore due to injury, distress, disease, or death).

There is simply no credible evidence to support claims that offshore wind has caused whale deaths. Over the last 10 months, President Trump and others in his administration have implied or alleged that offshore wind projects harm whales and that environmental reviews and other permitting processes for offshore wind were rushed or carried out improperly. Yet the administration has not identified a single piece of evidence or produced a credible scientific study to back up its claims.

On day one of his second term, President Trump issued a memorandum directing federal agencies to assess the impacts of offshore wind projects on wildlife, including marine mammals, but no assessment has been released. And on April 16, 2025, BOEM ordered the Empire Wind project off Long Island to halt construction while the agency “address[ed] feedback it has received, including from [NOAA], about the environmental analyses for that project[.]” However, the agency never provided an explanation as to why work was stopped or what feedback was received from NOAA, beyond publishing online an almost entirely redacted report. BOEM eventually allowed Empire Wind to resume construction.

Offshore wind projects undergo extensive multiyear reviews and are subject to a variety of laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires agencies to review the environmental impacts of development, and the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, which require protective measures to help ensure that activities do not harm protected whales. Existing federal permitting requirements provide a robust and established way for federal agencies to engage with developers, state and local agencies, Tribes, and the public to address potential impacts to the environment, national security, and other uses of the ocean from offshore wind projects.

These processes are proven and have helped protect wildlife and improve government decisionmaking for decades. Not to mention that the Trump administration is speaking out of both sides of its mouth—decrying multiyear offshore wind permitting processes as “rushed” while rolling back some of the very same permitting requirements for the fossil fuel industry, even though offshore oil and gas activities pose well-documented and major threats to whales like Cook Inlet beluga whales and Gulf of Mexico Rice’s whales.

Multiple species of great whales—North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and minke whales—are currently experiencing unusual mortality events off the East Coast. Such events are declared when there is a marked increase in death, injury, or morbidity (defined as sublethal injury or illness) for a particular mammal species. But again, there is no evidence that offshore wind development is the cause. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are by far the largest direct human sources of mortality for most whales. These two threats are pushing North Atlantic right whales to the brink of extinction.

For humpbacks, roughly 40 percent of necropsies show harm from vessel strike or entanglement. Necropsies of minke whales indicate that many animals are suffering from infectious diseases or have been impacted by human interaction. The other large whale species found off the East Coast—blue whales, fin whales, and sei whales—are all listed as endangered due to the lasting impacts of industrial whaling and are similarly impacted by human activities.

Climate change exacerbates the stress on whales. As ocean warming changes the distribution of key prey, large whale distributions are shifting. These shifts have brought whales into greater conflict with human activities like fishing and vessels and increased their susceptibility to malnourishment, poor health, and vessel strikes.

Rather than tilting at windmills, the Trump administration could take real steps to address the actual causes of whale injuries and deaths on the East Coast. Science confirms the value of vessel speed restrictions in reducing deaths of large whale species and sea turtles from vessel collisions. If it adopted additional 10-knot speed limits for certain vessels in whale habitat, NOAA would meaningfully reduce vessel strike risk.

The administration could also address entanglement in vertical buoy lines by issuing stronger regulations and investing in ropeless (on-demand) fishing systems for the American lobster and Jonah crab fisheries to offset the economic burden of obtaining new gear.

And, if the administration cares about the long-term health of whale populations in a changing climate, federal agencies should continue to advance responsibly developed offshore wind projects that include mitigation and monitoring requirements to protect whales and other wildlife. Offshore wind development is a critical component of mitigating climate change, and responsible offshore wind development enjoys broad support from coastal communities and environmental organizations.

Instead of attacking the renewable energy sources that we need to avoid climate catastrophe and firing the very scientists working to monitor and protect our beloved whales, the administration should implement science-based protections for these iconic marine mammals.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/seismictesting_549495370_900x600.jpg?h=b69e0e0e&itok=zRbJyx7V,N,,2025-10-10 13:08:10.196826

All approved 2026–29 utility plans and stipulated agreements between utilities and advocates can be found on the ICC’s Stakeholder Advisory Group website.

Consistently considered the key to our clean energy future and the lowest-cost energy resource, energy efficiency reduces household utility bills and energy demand, creates good-paying jobs, and reduces pollution from our buildings and strain on our energy systems. Since energy efficiency programs launched in 2008, they have demonstrated how critical more robust Illinois utilities’ investments are and how they can—and must—be improved.

Although arduous, the 2026–29 energy efficiency plan negotiations toward settlement were successful in modeling that under inclusive and accessible energy decision-making processes, historic gains can be made to ensure clean and efficient technology investments benefit all—especially communities that have been disenfranchised by the legacy energy system.

Key highlights of the approved negotiated portfolios

An increase in income-qualified (low-income) energy efficiency program investments by $25.4 million per year above their 2022–25 portfolio commitments and $41.7 million per year more than companies had first proposed to spend before negotiations began

Nearly $408 million per year invested in workforce training programs and initiatives to expand or launch new local and diverse businesses and community-action agencies in energy efficiency

A significantly expanded focus for electric utilities on installing heat pumps for electrification and in affordable multifamily buildings with highly inefficient electric resistance heat (i.e., window units and baseboards)

Sunsetting methane gas furnace rebates for higher-income residential Ameren customers after 2027 in light of federal appliance standards and focusing on building weatherization improvements for all Illinois gas consumers

Increasing ComEd’s focus on all-electric new construction/gut rehab programming and Ameren’s new income-qualified electrification program for propane-heated homes

Other successful outcomes include greater investments into small business, commercial, and industrial programs; more robust health and safety budgets to address pre-weatherization issues like mold and roof repair; and improved data reporting metrics to better hold utilities accountable to the effectiveness of their programs.

NRDC has estimated that through these programs, the equipment and building upgrades invested each year will, over their lifetime, save enough electricity to power roughly three million homes and save enough gas to heat about half a million homes annually. That’s the annual carbon pollution equivalent of 122,358 average gas-powered cars!

But the work doesn’t end here

The Illinois General Assembly is expected to gather during October 2025’s veto legislative session to reexamine Senate Bill 25 (SB25), a version of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act that the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition introduced last session—which was blocked before a vote could make it law on the final day of session.

SB25 makes critical improvements to the state’s electric energy efficiency program by increasing energy savings targets to 2 percent of total utility sales, introducing a goal to reduce peak demand on the grid, tripling minimum requirements for income-qualified investment, and increasing the amount of building electrification utilities can facilitate.

Blame Democrats",Sabrina Cynova,,,,,https://www.detroitchamber.com/oct-10-2025-this-week-in-government-dont-like-decoupling/,"Now, under state law, the federal tax changes will not have bearing on state taxes.
But, Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, is wary of a new economic development tool in general.
Additionally, the bill would require lawmakers to submit their request before the date the budget bill containing it was passed by their chamber for the first time.
“This legislation will help address that in the future.” The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has not reported receiving millions of that grant back to the corporation.
Anthony said she also didn’t want to create a cumbersome process for organizations that are traditionally overlooked in the state budget.","Policies like decoupling are “what you get when you support Democrats,” House Speaker Matt Hall said during a press conference on Tuesday.

After the budget passed, business groups pushed back on the plan to separate federal and state tax code, which was an integral part of the plan to provide funding for roads. A coalition of business chambers and stakeholder groups said it would make taxes more confusing and expensive for businesses, thereby making Michigan less competitive.

The legislation, HB 4961, now PA 24, responds to the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that allows businesses to pay less in taxes federally, around $677 million less to the state. Now, under state law, the federal tax changes will not have bearing on state taxes.

“These business groups support Democrats. Some of them even endorsed Gretchen Whitmer,” Hall said. “That’s what you get when you support Democrats… If you look at the Republican plan, the Republican plan was to eliminate $3 billion of waste, fraud, and abused. We showed how we could do that and fix the roads.”

He said that any plan that raised taxes for working Michigan residents, such as increasing the gas tax or raising registration fees, was untenable to Republicans.

“Actual working people and seniors don’t have lobbyists,” he said. “One thing we’re never going to have is increases in our hunting and fishing fees… as long as I’m speaker.”

Hall said he was willing to stand up to the interests of business groups.

“They don’t like my position on getting rid of the MEGA credits either,” he said. “The ones that get the MEGA credits and the ones that are affected by decoupling, they overlap a lot.”

Hall also touted other Republican wins in the budget, including no taxes on overtime and tips, record education spending– including money for the school safety and mental health, requiring 80% occupancy in state-owned buildings, eliminating unfilled full-time equivalent employees and putting money into the Public Safety Trust Fund.

“Our priorities were public safety, education and fixing roads. Democrats tried to tell you that you had to pick between fixing the roads and funding education, I always said we didn’t have to,” he said. “Decoupling helped us accomplish those priorities.”

The budget process also brought about greater transparency, Hall said.

“You saw the Democrats do some transparency in this budget,” he said. “The reason that these negotiations went on as long as they did…we were just at a standstill for a very long time over transparency.”

He went on to say that legislation was coming that would make the transparency requirements for public hearings and disclosure prior to the budget passing permanent.

During this budget process, Hall said Republicans achieved what they set out to do when they walked off the floor last term during lame duck, which was earned sick time, tipped minimum wage, and funding for local roads.

Next year’s budget will have more cuts, Hall said.

“We’re right sizing this budget,” he said. “We’re getting value for your dollars, and we’re setting priorities… this is the trajectory we’re moving on to eliminate further waste, fraud, and abuse next year.”

In a post-Strategic Outreach and Attraction Revenue fund Michigan, the question stands: If not SOAR money for economic development, then what’s next?

The SOAR fund was ended in the budget passed early Friday morning, not depositing its annual $500 million. Some lawmakers are calling for a brand-new tool to attract businesses and others want to see other issues addressed in efforts to attract businesses without subsidies.

With the critics of SOAR, one theme stands: getting rid of “picking winners and losers.”

In TV interviews on Friday following the passage, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the next challenge facing the state was not ceding the state’s “competitive edge” in creating more jobs in the state (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Oct. 6, 2025).

Stacey LaRouche, press secretary for Whitmer, said Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, and House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, have agreed to pass legislation before the end of the calendar year that would “make it easier to create and retain good-paying, high-skill jobs in Michigan.”

Hall told reporters on Tuesday that his preferred route in economic development would be through a bill not yet introduced by Rep. Mike Hoadley, R-Au Gres, that would change the High-Wage Incentive for Regional Employment program.

Hall also called for eliminating SOAR altogether outside of just defunding it as well as repealing mega credits.

He said the state needs a tool that can prove the jobs are being created and are high-paying, especially with promises from President Donald Trump to help Michigan land deals, and that economic development will take precedence over other conversations.

Hall said one economic development bill from Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, HB 5073, that would raise the tax cap for the transformational brownfield plans, is not a priority he would like to chase now.

Farhat was the first to say early Friday morning after the House passed the budget bills that the Legislature was going to pivot its focus to economic development (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Oct. 2, 2025).

Farhat told Gongwer News Service on Tuesday that the next economic development plan is a mix of addressing seemingly outside issues from direct business, like the roads deal to make infrastructure changes, but also in creating something new for business attraction.

“I’ll continue having these conversations around what that the new tools look like, but I’ll definitely say we’re going to want something that holds developers accountable to any promises they make, keep employers accountable, but it also spurs growth, and that is something that’s going to generate a positive impact,” Farhat said.

Farhat said the state cannot simply “do nothing” and allow families to face economic uncertainty.

But, Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, is wary of a new economic development tool in general.

“The best thing that can happen right now is for us not to replace SOAR with anything,” Wegela said. “There are already a million different ways businesses can get help from the state, and we should be repealing those instead of expanding them.”

There are more tax abatements and “tools” that businesses have at their disposal than he can name, Wegela said, making it “absurd” to him that there would be a need to replace SOAR with something else.

He said economic development should not be about handouts, but instead about making life more affordable for Michiganders including addressing public housing, having strong unions, funding roads, in which he said the funding plan probably does not go far enough for all the infrastructure needs, and other “basics” that result in a better economic impact.

The state can’t meet basic functionalities, Wegela said, but is planning again about how to build more tools for businesses.

“To be quite frank, I don’t care about giving businesses more tools, I care about working-class people having things that their taxes paid for first,” Wegela said. “The state hasn’t learned that lesson. I don’t think SOAR going away is going to (teach) that lesson. I guarantee you there is going to be some new magic wand that’s going to make business come here.”

Sen. Mallory McMorrow, D-Royal Oak, said the Legislature is in a “healthy place” where they can acknowledge that while SOAR was well-intentioned, it’s not working and look to the future instead.

She touted her legislation, SB 213 and SB 214 , as something that could change the course of development with the 10-year strategic plan along with a board that would develop and oversee the plan, which would address both underlying issues of access to education, housing, population and others, but then also creating tools that would make sense for the state.

She said there must be this plan before creating more avenues because if not, it may feel like the state is “grabbing copies of tools to put in a toolbox that may not necessarily take us into one singular direction.”

When it comes to Hall’s wishes, McMorrow said she aligns with him on the fact that the state cannot “incentivize our way out of our fundamentals,” like building the talent.

McMorrow said brownfield transformation is essential to avoid businesses passing communities by for other land and there is considerable support in her caucus for that.

Rep. Mark Tisdel, R-Rochester Hills, said his view is that if there were to be a new incentive tool, it should be run on a reimbursement schedule rather than upfront funding, wanting to see more accountability on the backend.

Tisdel pointed to boilerplate language in the recent budget as to what to expect out of a new phase of development that pushes for reimbursement instead of grants and the directives for money only being sent to established businesses or organizations, referencing the 2022 legislative grant for Fay Beydoun and her international business accelerator, Global Link International, which was created only a few days before the money was awarded.

Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers, said the plan after SOAR should be lower taxes across the board and less regulations so all businesses can thrive.

“Government is getting in the way with too much red tape, paperwork, compliance, data mining by the state, guilty until proven innocent type of governance is suppressing business in general,” Carra said. “If we can have a business-friendly environment with lower taxes across the board for everybody it will be setting our state up for success.”

Alongside the sunsetting of SOAR, lawmakers like Sen. Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, have raised the idea of dismantling the Michigan Economic Development Corporation altogether.

When looking at how the changes in SOAR could affect the MEDC, Wegela said there is still need for some of the uses of the corporation outside of government subsidies. He said there needs to be drastic leadership changes inside the corporation, but that there is no need to get rid of it.

The MEDC was formed in 1999 through an interlocal agreement as a successor to economic attraction efforts housed directly within state government.

He said while people like to blame the MEDC for problems in development, the Legislature ultimately gives the corporation “the green light.”

McMorrow said what she hears from her constituents is a call for decentralizing the economic development arm that may not “accurately reflect the needs or strengths of the different regions,” whether that means resizing or spreading out across the state.

She said Michigan is now in the position that Virginia was in a few years ago, in which their lawmakers were upset with their equivalent of the MEDC, that led to “steep reform” and a plan for development like hers.

On the other hand, Tisdel said there isn’t really a purpose for the MEDC, envisioning the reimbursement incentives he wants to see handled by the Department of Treasury, wanting to push against potential political pressure in these grants that he says the MEDC has. Carra wants to fully abolish the MEDC as well, saying getting rid of SOAR is steps in the right direction.

When asked if there is one correct answer to economic development in the state, Carra said “stop doing it.”

“Let the market run its course,” Carra said.

Danielle Emerson, spokesperson for the MEDC, said in a statement to Gongwer News Service that while SOAR was contemplated to sunset, MEDC will be working with the Legislature on “tools and resources to meet this moment in time while continuing to provide support for Michigan’s small businesses, entrepreneurs, local communities, and more the way we always have.”

The MEDC also released a statement after the budget was signed by Whitmer, saying the corporation would continue work on the “Make it in Michigan” economic development strategy.

“We are encouraged that this budget will sustain investment in job creation and grow our tax base by supporting small businesses and communities on both peninsulas, ensuring continued focus on people, places and projects across the state,” MEDC Chief Executive Officer Quentin Messer Jr. said in a statement. “This budget provides a path forward for Team Michigan, investing in programs ranging from the arts and tourism and hospitality to supporting dual use aerospace and defense activities. While work remains, these budgetary investments ensure Pure Michigan remains a great place to visit, work, create businesses, and put down roots.”

A cannabis industry group has sued the state over a newly passed wholesale tax on cannabis products as part of a long-term road funding deal, arguing the Legislature and executive branch violated the state Constitution.

In a lawsuit, filed Tuesday afternoon in the Court of Claims the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association contends that the Legislature violated the Constitution by passing a law that amends a voter-initiated law without the necessary three-fourths vote required in both chambers.

The bill, HB 4951, now Public Act 23 of 2025, was signed Tuesday by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer moments before the suit was filed.

The suit is against the Department of Treasury and Treasurer Rachael Eubanks in her capacity as state treasurer.

As passed, PA 23 enacts a 24% wholesale tax on cannabis products in Michigan, a move that was staunchly opposed by industry when it began moving through the Legislature late last month. The tax will be collected beginning Jan. 1, 2026.

Member of the House voted 78-21 for the bill on Sept. 25, five votes shy of a three-quarters majority. The Senate early last Friday morning passed the tax 19-17.

In its suit, the group states that the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act passed by voters in 2018 is the exclusive vehicle for imposing excise taxes on all sales and transfers of marijuana.

“Section 13 of MRTMA provides that “in addition to all other taxes, an excise tax is imposed on each marihuana establishment and on each person who sells marihuana[.]”” the suit states. “The import of this language is clear: while other taxes may generally apply to marihuana, such as the sales tax, MRTMA is the exclusive mechanism for imposing excise taxes. Legislative authority over marihuana excises taxes is exclusive to MRTMA; no other statute may intrude upon or duplicate the marihuana excise tax. Thus, additional excise taxes require a direct amendment to MRTMA itself.”

The Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act created under PA 23 of 2025 by the Legislature without the three-quarters majorities in both chambers is in violation of Article 2, Section 9 of the Michigan Constitution, the lawsuit states.

It was pointed out that many of the definitions and parts of language in the new act were lifted directly from the 2018 voter-initiated law, meaning that Treasury must rely on the 2018 law to implement and enforce the newly passed law.

“Any ambiguity as to which transaction, products, or entities are subject to CRFTA’s excise tax can only be resolved by reference to MRTMA,” the suit states. “It is impossible to construe CRFTA independently without reference to MRTMA. CRFTA is therefore fundamentally dependent on MRTMA.”

The lawsuit also alleges that the new law violates Article 4, Section 24 of the Constitution, which states that no laws can contain more than one subject, nor can a bill be altered by the Legislature to change its original purpose as determined by its content and not alone by its title.

Further, the new law unlawfully amends the 2018 tax law by reference, the suit adds.

The suit seeks a declaratory judgment that PA 23 of 2025 is invalid and unenforceable. The group also seeks an order that the defendants comply with the court’s order and judgement as well as provide for any other relief the court deems proper.

As part of the deal to pass the state’s budget for fiscal year 2025-26 last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee met on Wednesday to discuss a bill that would enshrine transparency measures around budget earmarks, or legislatively directed spending items, in statute.

The committee took up SB 596, which outlines the requirements for earmark transparency, which would require requests to include the name of the requesting legislator, the total amount of the item and estimated cost of the project, the name of the intended recipient or intended location, the expected outcomes and deliverables of the request, a statement attesting there was no conflict of interest, verification of a recipient’s nonprofit status, or a statement that the recipient was not a for-profit entity. Additionally, the bill would require lawmakers to submit their request before the date the budget bill containing it was passed by their chamber for the first time. The bill would allow each chamber to establish other deadlines.

The bill is similar to the earmark transparency passed by the House earlier this year (See Gongwer Michigan Report June 4, 2025).

“The Senate may add more exposure, and the House may have its own spin,” bill sponsor and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Sarah Anthony, said. “Ideally, we would have a shared set of disclosure that we would all make sure are contemplated, and then the flavor the Senate does it versus the House, I think ultimately it’s up to this body.”

The goal, ultimately, Anthony said, is for the public to know how their tax dollars are being spent.

Sen. John Damoose, R-Harbor Springs, said he was eager for this form of transparency in the budget process.

“By and large, I want people to know that I have something in the budget. We’re all trying to prove to our constituents back home that we’re effective for them,” he said.

Damoose went on to say having these measures in place also protected lawmakers from having earmarks put into the budget in their name without their knowledge.

“Now that we have this, we can take credit, basically, for the things we did try to get in there and also have proof of the things we didn’t try to get in,” he said.

The bill also includes requirements for recipients to enter an agreement with the state before receiving the funds, and if they are found not to meet the terms of the agreement, the state would be able to cease payments and cancel the grant if a satisfactory correction plan was not submitted.

“Even when we look at the Fay Beydoun incident, it should not have taken that long to retrieve taxpayer dollars,” Anthony said. “This legislation will help address that in the future.”

The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has not reported receiving millions of that grant back to the corporation.

Senators raised questions about the requirement of making grants only for nonprofit or not for profit entities, which Anthony said could be discussed further.

Anthony said she also didn’t want to create a cumbersome process for organizations that are traditionally overlooked in the state budget.

She said she had little interest in taking up some of the other transparency legislation passed by the House, such as the cooling off period for lawmakers before becoming lobbyists. Instead, Anthony said it would be better to pass legislation that would open the House, the Senate and the Governor’s Office up to FOIA requests, and other legislation that would get the public more involved in transparency.

“It would be great if your average Michigander was interested and involved in (the budget) process. I have always been committed to lifting up the voices of men and women across our state, so I’m looking for ways to make the process not just more transparent, but more accessible,” Anthony said. “I would be thrilled if the Speaker started with FOIA reform. When we talk about transparency, shining a light on how decisions are made in this place is something that I think the speaker has supported in the past. It was one of the first things that came out of our Senate majority this year. It all starts with FOIA reform and making sure that we have a process. From there, I think we build upon that.”

Anthony also briefly discussed the path forward for economic development, now that the budget is passed and transparency legislation is moving.

She said that people on both sides of the aisle were tired of incentives that didn’t yield results for taxpayers.

“I hope that we can get to a place that we can have strong tools to make sure that we are competitive on not just a national stage, but a global stage,” she said. “What we don’t need to do is pay corporations and not get much back in return.”",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Michigan-State-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:03:46.508980

As the EPA’s authority expanded through the passage of landmark environmental statutes, criticism of the agency has grown to a point where deregulation has become a recurring rallying cry for industries and conservative politicians who see EPA rules as costly, burdensome and an overreach of federal power.

“We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years.
The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide.
“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said.
Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.","DES MOINES — Iowa biofuels and corn experts congratulated Nebraska for its first shipments of carbon dioxide on the Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline, but said Wednesday that the development means Iowa is no longer king at turning corn into ethanol.

Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said now that Nebraska has a functioning CO2 pipeline, ethanol plants in the state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.

“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a new conference Wednesday. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”

Trailblazer and 45z

Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3.

The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide. By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit.

These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican led tax cut law, known as the “one big beautiful bill.”

Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.”

Impacts to Iowa

According to IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.

“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.”

Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy.

Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs have also added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.

“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”

Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050.

Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases.

“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.”

Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”

“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said.

Harder said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend.

Challenges

Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”

“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.

Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.

The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.

Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They have also said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain.

Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines.

On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026.

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restricting law in South Dakota. The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage.

Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.”

“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_8614-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:08:55.063334

A Bureau of Land Management webpage providing updates on the progress of Esmeralda Seven Solar—a 6.2 gigawatt (GW) installation in rural Nevada—now states that the endeavor is cancelled, without further context. If built to full spec, the site would’ve been one of the largest power plants in the United States, comparable to the Grand Coulee Dam (about 6.8 GW).

Of course, this should come as no surprise to anyone following the actions of Trump 2.0’s offices. Solar, if you haven’t heard by now, is a big ‘scam’- and it must be a really good one, too, considering so many utilities, states, and hyperscalers continue to fall for it and pursue clean energy projects regardless of federal sentiment and a looming tax incentive rugpull.

If you can think of another use for 62,000 acres of desert wasteland superior to providing clean power to millions of homes and businesses, please enlighten me. And while you’re at it, take any lingering ‘American energy dominance’ rhetoric somewhere else, because I don’t buy it for a second. Those are just words, and the actions of the administration show they have no intention of ‘winning the AI race’ or being dominant in anything other than shooting itself in the foot, repeatedly, at the expense of Americans coast to coast.

“The president doesn’t like windmills” is not even close to being a valid reason to sabotage an entire industry; “The sun doesn’t always shine” is how a six-year-old thinks about solar power.

Clean energy is not just a part of our future- it is the only future, and the longer we wait to catch up to China (and Europe in many respects, quite frankly), the worse off we’ll be for it.

Arevon Starts Up Solar Operations in Indiana

Developer, owner, and operator Arevon Energy announced this week that operations are underway at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Pike County, Indiana. Together, the projects add 264 megawatts (MWdc) to the grid and are the company’s first owned and operational utility-scale projects in the Hoosier State.

Ratts 1 and Heirloom represent an investment of nearly $400 million and will disburse more than $86 million to local governments over their lifespans, supporting schools, infrastructure, and other essential public services. The two facilities employed more than 200 full-time equivalent personnel to build the projects. Ratts 1 Solar is under a long-term power purchase agreement with Indiana Municipal Power Agency (IMPA), and hyperscaler Meta is the offtaker for Heirloom Solar.

“Ratts 1 and Heirloom are about more than megawatts — they are tangible illustrations of the positive and real impact renewable energy can bring to local communities,” said Arevon CEO Kevin Smith. “These facilities will produce American-made power for decades, while also supporting Pike County’s economy and quality of life. Arevon is proud to be a long-term partner here, as we continue to invest in Indiana’s future.”

“Pike County is an energy community, and renewable energy sources are a piece of our diversified energy strategy. We are grateful for Arevon’s investment in our area,” added Ashley Willis, MPA, EDFP, Executive Director at the Pike County Economic Development Corporation. “Solar power is a wonderful asset for rural communities, like Pike County, to increase assessed value and has had a positive impact on our tax revenue for our taxing districts.”

Arevon, which owns and operates more than 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of solar and energy storage projects across 17 states, is actively growing its portfolio in the Midwest. Besides Ratts 1 and Heirloom, the company is currently constructing the two-phase 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri, and developed and managed the construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company.

Base Power Raises A Billion Bucks

Typical fundraising announcements on this website rarely include a corresponding dollar value starting with the letter ‘B,’ but that should tell you how hot energy storage is right now.

Texas-based distributed storage pioneer Base Power announced Wednesday that it has raised $1 billion in Series C financing, led by Addition. All other major investors in the round are re-investing, including: Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, 137 Ventures, Terrain, and Waybury. New major investors include Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” stated Zach Dell, CEO and co-founder of Base Power. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

In less than two years, Base Power has deployed more than 100 MWh of residential battery capacity, making it one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the country. The company has also partnered with homebuilder Lennar and several utilities on virtual power plants, recently qualifying for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the grid.

Base Power is building its first energy storage and power electronics factory at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press in the heart of downtown Austin.

Doral Finds Offtaker for Cold Creek Solar

Utility-scale developer and independent power producer Doral Renewables has executed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a corporate buyer for its 430 MWac Cold Creek Solar Project located in Schleicher and Tom Green Counties, Texas. The Agreement covers 75% of the facility’s energy output and 100% of the associated Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The Cold Creek Solar project is expected to deliver over 1 million MWh annually.

Cold Creek Solar is expected to deliver over 1 million MWh annually. The project will boost local infrastructure and community impact initiatives, such as road improvements and emergency responders, as part of its community engagement. The project also supported a local non-profit during a recent summer flooding emergency.

“Our ability to work with top companies and utilities is a testament to our business plan and commitment to new renewable energy projects across the United States,” said Sean Boyle, Vice President, Markets of Doral Renewables. “This new relationship is a substantial accomplishment and a foundational agreement as Doral continues to expand its operating portfolio across the country”.

The transaction increases the company’s contracted energy generation to more than 1.6 GW in total.

Nexamp Scores $330 Million Construction Warehouse Facility

Distributed solar and storage solutions company Nexamp announced the closing of a three-year, $330 million Construction Warehouse Facility (CWF) with a consortium of leading financial institutions. The financing will enable Nexamp to develop, construct, and finance a revolving portfolio of approximately 20 new distributed generation assets, advancing the company’s mission to address increased energy demand with reliable, affordable domestic resources.

The CWF provides flexible construction capital to support Nexamp’s near-term pipeline of solar and energy storage projects. Once completed, these assets are expected to transition into long-term financing structures, including tax equity funding or refinancing, ensuring sustainable growth and deployment of renewable energy infrastructure nationwide.

MUFG committed $200 million as the largest lender in the facility, also serving as Mandated Lead Arranger and Administrative Agent. ING followed with a $100 million allocation and additional responsibilities as Mandated Lead Arranger, Lender, Hedge Provider, and Green Loan Structuring Agent. Siemens Financial Services contributed $30 million as Joint Lead Arranger. U.S. Bank National Association acted as Collateral Agent.

Zaid Ashai, CEO of Nexamp, said the transaction marks a pivotal moment in the company’s expansion.

“By securing flexible construction capital, we are better positioned to deliver the clean energy projects that communities across the country urgently need as demand rises. Solar continues to be the most cost-effective and easy-to-deploy source of new electricity, outpacing all other sources by a wide margin already this year,” Ashai explained.

Nightpeak Fires up 150 MW Texas Battery

Do-it-all developer and operator Nightpeak Energy announced last Friday that Bocanova Power, a 150 MW, 2-hour duration battery storage project located in Brazoria County, Texas, is now operating. Located 24 miles south of downtown Houston, Bocanova Power reached commercial operation in August 2025 and is now providing quick responding, flexible power to support the Houston region’s peak capacity needs.

Bocanova Power utilizes Tesla’s Megapack 2 XL battery storage systems manufactured in Lathrop, California. The facility operates under a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment-grade power purchaser, unnamed by the company. Nord/LB and MUFG Bank served as co-lead arrangers on the debt financing, which included a tax equity bridge loan, construction to term loan, and letters of credit. Traditional tax equity partnership financing was also utilized for this transaction.

“We submitted an interconnection request for Bocanova Power in mid-2023 and just two years later, this 150 MW project is providing flexible, dispatchable capacity to the Texas grid. Bocanova Power demonstrates the speed at which Nightpeak Energy is overcoming complex challenges to energize projects that support America’s growing need for affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” noted Paris Hays, co-founder and CEO/CDO of Nightpeak Energy.

Nightpeak says its focus is on developing projects in the Western United States and Texas specifically, where the rapid growth of intermittent renewable energy resources has created a significant need for flexible, dispatchable generation assets.

NineDot Lands $175 Million Debt Facility

Northeast community-scale battery energy storage systems developer Ninedot has completed a $175 million revolving debt financing from Deutsche Bank.

The company will use the financing to support activities across its development timeline, from grid interconnection deposits to equipment procurement and project construction. NineDot supports a vision for broad, distributed energy storage throughout New York City, in alignment with New York State’s goal of having 6000 megawatts of battery storage in operation by 2030. The facility also enabled NineDot to pay back its existing revolver for funding grid interconnection deposits with NY Green Bank.

“NineDot’s mission is to create innovative urban energy solutions for a cleaner and more sustainable future, and battery storage is a key part of that for New York City,” said David Arfin, NineDot Energy CEO and co-founder. “With seven projects operating during this past hot summer, we’ve proven that we can deliver safe and reliable energy solutions in a dense urban area. Our next step is to accelerate our growth and scale our business, and Deutsche Bank recognized the importance of and opportunity in our approach.”

NineDot Energy currently has seven operating projects across four locations in The Bronx and Staten Island. These projects recently supported approximately 26,000 New York City households on hot summer days. With more than 60 additional projects in some phase of development or construction, NineDot remains on target to achieve its goal of having 400 MW in development, construction, or operation by the end of 2026.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FT-Template-31-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:50.300862

Maybe that’s the lesson Wyatt left us with: Who cares if you get shot down three times?","I’m sure there are a lot of folks who will only attend Oscar Wyatt’s funeral to make sure he’s dead. The Houston oilman, who died Wednesday at age 101, made plenty of enemies.

In the seventies, the questionable business practices of his company, Coastal States Gas, stuck the people of San Antonio with sky-high bills. In the eighties, he convinced one of his stepsons to sue his uncle, a.k.a. Wyatt’s brother-in-law, Robert Sakowitz, when he thought the latter was mismanaging the family department store chain. In the nineties, he paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s government, in violation of United Nations sanctions. (For that he was convicted, at age 83, and spent nine months in federal prison.)

Married four times, Wyatt was considered—to put it politely—a swordsman. “Oscar is the only man I know that has a mattress strapped to his back for convenience,” his first wife told Texas Monthly’s Jan Jarboe Russell.

But he was also shrewd, charming, hilarious, and fearless. He worked with his BFF, former Texas Governor John Connally, to convince Saddam Hussein to release American hostages—after Wyatt had warned George H. W. Bush, whom he did not particularly like, not to go to war with Iraq over Kuwait in the first place.

I’m sure there were many other good deeds that would make Wyatt’s bad deeds pale in comparison—he was very sentimental—but there’s really no point in trying to be binary about him. Wyatt was sui generis. Love him or hate him, we may never see the likes of him again—he was an exemplar of the brash, wily, hell-for-leather Texan. J. R. Ewing was a cheap imitation.

Born in Beaumont, he was shaped by a fatherless, poverty-ridden childhood in Navasota. After serving as a bomber pilot during World War II and graduating from Texas A&M with a mechanical engineering degree, he sold drill bits in the oil fields. He founded his first oil company with an $800 loan and by 1955 had started Coastal. Over the subsequent decades, he did whatever he had to do to acquire millions upon millions, and eventually billions.

His fourth marriage was to Lynn Wyatt (neé Sakowitz), whose name was rarely free of the modifier “international socialite.” So, along with all the Middle Eastern strongmen and U.S. politicians that Wyatt could reach with one phone call, Oscar found himself in the company of Princess Grace, Mick Jagger, Elton John, Karl Lagerfeld, Andy Warhol, Liza Minelli, Rudolph Nureyev, Truman Capote, Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and the Reagans (whom he wasn’t particularly fond of either).

Reading about Wyatt’s constant socializing and deal cutting, I sometimes wondered whether he ever wished he could just stay at home and watch a football game while popping a cold one and snacking on pretzel sticks. But that wasn’t his thing. He nurtured, pruned, and shaped his spectacular life in a way most people couldn’t even begin to imagine. Who puts his own plane into a dive while proposing marriage to scare his lover into saying yes? Who shoots feral hogs from a helicopter at his South Texas ranch to entertain (or shock) his wife’s hoity-toity guests?

Later, after serving his prison time, suffering a stroke, and hitting his nineties, Wyatt was much diminished. Wheelchair-bound, he was unable to speak anywhere close to as fast as he could think. His once bright eyes grew vacant.

Yet he seemed to enjoy his ninety-seventh birthday celebration, in 2021, when he was inducted into the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame at a fancy-pants party at the Lone Star Flight Museum. Old friends, many white-haired and memorable from the heady oil-boom days of the seventies, patted his shoulder and gave him hugs. A B-25, the type of plane he had flown, was prominently displayed. Wyatt wept when his sons paid him tribute, and he squeezed a friend’s hand three times to indicate how many times he had been shot down.

If Oscar Wyatt wasn’t exactly a hero, maybe he was something more important. He was the last real deal, the cunning rogue who provided living proof that our state’s mythology wasn’t just a lot of hot air.

Des Moines – The Iowa Environmental Council (IEC), Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC), and Food & Water Watch have sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) challenging the agency’s action to rescind its partial disapproval of Iowa’s 2024 Impaired Waters list under Clean Water Act section 303(d).

EPA issued that partial disapproval on December 30, 2024, listing seven water segments in the state as impaired due to nitrate levels. IEC and ELPC commented in support of the proposed additions to the 2024 impaired waters list in order to limit nitrate contamination in drinking water sources. Drinking nitrate-contaminated water is linked to a host of negative health outcomes including birth defects and cancers.

On July 11, 2025, EPA took the highly unusual step of rescinding its partial disapproval, claiming that it was removing the newly listed impaired segments because it was “appropriate to allow EPA to evaluate additional information.” This unprecedented action means that major rivers in Iowa are not treated as exceeding the nitrate standard for purposes of the Clean Water Act. (Read more about the timeline, the Impaired Waters List, and nitrate impairments here.)

The public only discovered EPA’s action weeks after its decision. EPA and DNR did not provide notice to the public or opportunity for input.

“EPA’s action undermines the public process defined in federal regulations and limits public transparency,” said Michael Schmidt, General Counsel for IEC. “No law says that EPA can change its mind after it made a final decision the way it did in this case, especially when it is weakening protections for the public. The path to this decision lacks transparency and is based on outdated and incomplete information.”

EPA rescinded its December listing of the waters after DNR explained its position in a phone call and provided additional information. IEC submitted a records request that showed the only written communication was an email sending decades-old documents that had already been submitted to EPA, along with EPA’s own decades-old approval letter. The DNR email did not include the DNR position cited in EPA’s letter.

“EPA rolling back water quality protections based on ‘back room’ conversations is not how agencies should operate,” said Josh Mandelbaum, Senior Attorney at ELPC. “While Iowa is in the midst of ongoing and serious water quality problems, there is no justification for EPA to flip-flop because of old documents it already had, especially its own letter from 2002.”

Food & Water Watch Staff Attorney Dani Replogle said:

“The data is clearer than ever that Iowa waterways are overwhelmed with persistent, toxic nitrate contamination. Iowans need more clean water protections — not less. EPA’s baseless decision to turn its back on central Iowa’s water crisis without even providing an opportunity for public input does not inspire confidence in the federal agency meant to safeguard clean water and protect our health. Iowans demand and deserve better.”

The environmental groups’ letter highlights that the new direction will increase regulatory costs for downstream water users, including Iowa’s most populous metropolitan areas. DNR and EPA seek to treat the drinking water standard for nitrate as a long-term, chronic standard – despite the short-term effects such as blue baby syndrome.

“While this path may seem complex, the issue is simple: EPA is not doing the important work of protecting public health. Claiming that our waterways meet drinking water standards when EPA has found those same nitrate levels could cause blue baby syndrome is unjustified and dangerous,” said Colleen Fowle, Water Program Director for IEC. “Removing the impairment at the same time Central Iowa had to implement unprecedented water use restrictions made no sense. EPA’s action fails to put the onus on the polluters to adopt practices that will actually fix the problem.”

The letter sent by the environmental groups states that because EPA has reopened the process to consider additional information, it should consider public input. The letter includes additional information about the application of the drinking water standard on a short-term basis.

$26 billion in reduced energy system costs to 2035 compared to the previous Labor Government’s early closure plan.

The Energy Roadmap provides clarity for the future of coal and gas, and support for private sector investment in renewables and firming projects.

The Crisafulli Government has unveiled its Energy Roadmap to deliver affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for Queenslanders.

By improving Queensland’s existing energy assets while building what is needed for the future, the Crisafulli Government is putting downward pressure on energy prices, optimising investment to respect taxpayer money and boosting private sector investment in new generation.

The Roadmap presents a sensible and pragmatic plan to meet Queensland’s energy needs, contrasting with the undeliverable timeframes, poorly scoped projects and tens of billions of dollars in cost blowouts under Labor’s implausible Energy and Jobs Plan.

It also reduces energy system costs for taxpayers by $26 billion to 2035, preventing the average Queensland household paying an extra $1035 a year that they would have paid under Labor.

The Roadmap includes:

$400 million Queensland Energy Investment Fund and Queensland Investment Corporation’s new Investor Gateway to drive private sector investment in new energy generation and firming projects.

$1.6 billion Electricity Maintenance Guarantee to improve our current energy assets.

Clear decision-making framework for the operation of state-owned coal assets, balancing system needs, asset integrity, and economic viability.

A tender for 400MW of new gas-fired generation in Central Queensland.

Consolidated management of future pumped hydro proposals by QIC to provide a consistent approach to assessment and investment.

New $10 million investment into community level batteries for greater solar storage and to help manage minimum system load.

Construction of the Eastern Link of the CopperString transmission line in North Queensland and beginning of work on the Western Link.

Establishment of Regional Energy Hubs to put downward pressure on development costs.

Development of a new code of conduct for renewable energy developers to guide responsible behaviour and set community expectations.

Treasurer and Minister for Energy David Janetzki said the Energy Roadmap was based on economics and engineering, not ideology.

“Our Energy Roadmap delivers what Queenslanders need, which is affordable and reliable energy that enhances their quality of life, fuels economic growth, and ensures long-term sustainability, all while ensuring our state is an attractive destination for private sector capital and creating jobs,” Mr Janetzki said.

“Labor’s energy plan lacked credibility, was undeliverable and would have resulted in Queensland households paying thousands more on top of their energy bills.”

Underpinned by robust electricity system modelling and extensive consultation with investors, industry, and stakeholders, the Energy Roadmap highlights the importance of leveraging existing assets to keep energy prices low while planning for the future.

“The former Labor Government’s ideological decision to close coal units by 2035, regardless of their condition, is officially abolished,” Mr Janetzki said.

“Queensland’s coal-fired fleet is the youngest in the country and state-owned coal generators will continue to operate for as long as they are needed in the system and supported by the market.

“This is an economic solution that places downward pressure on prices for households, businesses, and industry, while ensuring developers have the confidence to plan for the future.

""We’re laying the groundwork for private capital to flow into new energy infrastructure, unlocking economic growth and ensuring Queensland remains competitive in an evolving energy market.”

Chair, Senate Environmental Quality Committee

1021 O Street, Room 3230

Sacramento, CA 95814

RE: Support for AB 30 (Alvarez) State Air Resources Board: gasoline specifications: ethanol blends

Dear Chair Blakespear,

On behalf of Growth Energy, I write in support of AB 30 (Alvarez) which would make transportation fuel blends of up to 15% ethanol (E15) legal for sale and use in California. Growth Energy is the world’s largest trade association representing 97 U.S. biorefineries that

produce more than nine billion gallons of cleaner-burning, renewable fuel annually. Our members account for more than half of the bioethanol produced in the United States each year. Together, we are working to bring consumers better and more affordable choices at the fuel pump, improve air quality, and protect the environment for future generations. We remain committed to helping diversify our country’s energy portfolio, grow more energy jobs, decarbonize our nation’s energy mix, sustain family farms, and drive down the costs of transportation fuels for consumers.

AB 30 will significantly reduce light-duty fuel costs for California’s consumers. A recent study by the University of California, Berkeley and the United States Naval Academy indicates that California drivers could save as much as 20 cents per gallon with the inclusion of E15 in the fuel supply. The same study indicates California drivers could save as much as $2.7 billion annually at the pump if E15 replaced E10.

Furthermore, E15 reduces fuel emissions and has notable environmental benefits. Testing by the University of California, Riverside shows E15 significantly reduces tailpipe emissions compared to E10. This includes the reduction of greenhouse gases and harmful

particulates that contribute to air pollution.

E15 is well tested and has already been used across the country. After extensively testing the fuel in 86 vehicles for a total of six million miles, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved E15 in 2011 for all passenger vehicles model year 2001 and newer. Since

its approval, E15 has efficiently fueled 150 billion miles driven in the United States. E15 is available for sale in 34 states at more than 4,200 fuel retail locations. It is time for California to approve the sale and use of E15, just as every other state in the nation has done.

For the reasons outlined above, Growth Energy is pleased to support AB 30 and urge an AYE vote on this critical measure. We look forward to continued collaboration with your office and other policymakers to implement E15, reduce air emissions, and make fuel more affordable for Californians.

Sincerely,

Emily Skor
