NLC India Limited will invest significantly to boost its power generation. The company aims to increase its capacity substantially by 2030. A large portion of the investment is dedicated to renewable energy projects. NLC is also exploring opportunities in critical mineral mining globally. NLC India Renewables Limited is planning an IPO.

NLC India Ltd, a public sector enterprise, is planning to invest Rs 1.25 lakh crore by 2030 to expand its capacity from the existing 6.7 gigawatt to 20 gigawatt, Prasanna Kumar Motupalli, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of the company has said.

He said, out of Rs 1.25 lakh crore planned capex, the company will be spending around Rs 65,000 crores on renewables and other green initiatives, while around Rs 45,000 crores will be earmarked for thermal and around 15,000 crores for mining.

The official elaborated that out of the Rs 65,000 crore capex on renewables, around Rs 15,000 crore will be on the battery storage system.

""We are having an aggressive capacity addition plan, adding the renewable capacity as well as the conventional capacity to take the capacity from the existing 6.7 gigawatt to 20 gigawatt. For that, the Capex requirement is around 1.25 lakh crore by 2030,"" Kumar told PTI Videos.

NLCIL is arranging finance for the planned capex of Rs 1.25 lakh crore through internal accruals, domestic loans, Initial Public Offering's (IPOs), External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), he explained.

Live Events

NLC is contemplating starting a consulting business abroad, initially in Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Africa, and the Middle East and acquire battery mineral assets overseas - especially in Vanadium, Cobalt, Lithium and Copper, among others, he said.

Recently, NLC got two critical mineral blocks in Chhattisgarh and with that experience the company is exploring the possibilities of critical mineral mining abroad also.

""Some due diligence is being done for some lithium mines in Mali. And some copper and cobalt mines in the African state of Congo. So, we are open for exploration of critical minerals across the globe. We are finding opportunities and doing due diligence to take it forward,"" he said.

NLC India Renewables Limited (NIRL), a wholly owned subsidiary of NLC, is expected to go for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) during the current financial year aiming to enable value unlocking in the renewable business for its parent company.

The proposed IPO will help raise funds for NIRL, which will likely be utilised for green energy projects.

According to the official, NLC has already received in-principle approval to invest up to Rs 3,720 crore in NIRL, subject to necessary approvals and compliance with guidelines.

NLCIL signed an agreement with the Telangana government to supply 200 MW renewable energy. The construction of the project in Gujarat is expected to be completed in the current financial year.

NCL India earned a consolidated net profit of Rs 2714 crore on a total income from operations of Rs 15283 crore during the last financial year.

Used EV sales topped 100,000 for the first time in the second quarter, according to industry-services business Cox Automotive. It is a rare bright spot for the EV industry, which is contending with lackluster demand and the looming elimination of federal tax credits. Sales for new EVs fell in each of the last three months.

What buyers are finding in the used market is deals. Used EV prices fell nearly 32% in 2024 from 2023, almost 10 times the drop in used gas-powered car prices, according to iSeeCars.com, an automotive research site.

Last year, the average used EV cost around $30,900, in line with the average used gas car, even though a new EV sells for $17,300 more than a comparable gas model on average.

Discounts have drawn in buyers like Christopher Andrzejczak, a systems engineer from Orlando, Fla., who has owned five EVs over the past decade. Last year, he picked up a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E with 6,000 miles on it for $36,000—less than half of its sticker price.

That price included an extended warranty and several upgrades like tinted windows that the previous owner had paid for.

Deals on used EVs are especially pronounced because EVs lose value faster than gas-powered cars once they drive off the lot. The depreciation often reflects concerns about battery life and longevity. Replacing a battery out of warranty is costly but uncommon. New technology could quickly make a used EV antiquated. The vehicles also require specialized parts and labor that make them more expensive to repair when something goes wrong.

EV owners spend roughly half as much on upkeep and repairs compared with gas-car drivers, according to Consumer Reports. Over the life of the car, that adds up to about $4,600 in maintenance costs for an EV compared with $9,200 for a traditional one.

Used cars also don’t depreciate as quickly. In January, Andrzejczak purchased a used 2021 Audi E-Tron Prestige for $27,000, with the intent to get ahead of tariffs and eventually gift it to his teenage son. When his son made it clear he wasn’t interested in March, Andrzejczak sold the car to Carvana for $26,000.

“It’s like I borrowed it for a few months for $1,000,” he said.

Jason Wallace, who owns Electrified Autos, a used EV dealership in Joplin, Mo., says more buyers are realizing they can save money by making the switch to electric. In an economy pinched by years of inflation and high interest rates, he said, “that’s all that matters to them.”

The used-car dealership has been in Wallace’s family since 1975 when his grandfather opened it, but Wallace and his brother made the decision to focus exclusively on selling electric vehicles last year. So far, it has paid off.

“There’s demand for EVs at the right price,” he said. “Not everyone is going to spend $60,000 on a car but they will look harder when it’s $20,000 or less, and we have no problem selling those.”

Another reason for the rush is looming changes in EV policy. A $4,000 federal tax credit for used EVs is set to expire at the end of September as a result of the new tax law passed earlier this month. The $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, which made new models more affordable and helped keep prices down in the used market, is also expiring at the same time.

Eli Cook decided to buy an electric vehicle after researching gas prices in the Bay Area. He and his wife, both recent college graduates, plan to move there from Missouri later this year for work. Expecting far higher gas prices in California than Missouri, the couple wanted something affordable and efficient. As newlyweds, they are determined to avoid going into debt.

They could have waited until after the move, but worried they would miss out on the tax credit. Last month, they paid $15,000 cash for a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The window sticker, Cook said, showed it had sold for nearly $40,000 four years earlier.

“It really seems like we’re buying the dip for used EVs right now,” he said.

,American Energy,2025-07-13 15:42:07+00:00,STLtoday.com,"Ameren aims to replace Rush Island coal power with gas plant, batteries - St. Louis Post-Dispatch","bryce gray, Post-Dispatch, Image courtesy of Ameren, Jacob Barker",,,,,https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_bf121232-0833-4a00-9b46-65ca6df6c842.html,"Collectively, the 800-megawatt gas plant and the 400-megawatt battery storage facility would roughly match the generating potential that Rush Island had, taking advantage of the site’s existing transmission capacity and access to the power grid.
The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.
“The technology has matured.” The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.
Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.
Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.","Ameren is looking to build a natural gas-fired power plant and the company’s first large lithium-ion battery facility on the Jefferson County site of its former coal-based Rush Island Energy Center, which closed last year after continuous Clean Air Act violations.

The St. Louis-based electric utility will call the complex the Big Hollow Energy Center, the company announced late last month. Collectively, the 800-megawatt gas plant and the 400-megawatt battery storage facility would roughly match the generating potential that Rush Island had, taking advantage of the site’s existing transmission capacity and access to the power grid.

“That was the idea,” said Ajay Arora, Ameren Missouri’s senior vice president and chief development officer. “The infrastructure is extremely valuable … certainly the transmission aspect of it.”

The proposed switch to gas at one of its former coal plant sites follows a familiar playbook for Ameren. The utility is also building an 800-megawatt gas plant — called the Castle Bluff Energy Center — for about $800 million at the former site of its smallest and oldest coal plant, the Meramec Energy Center in south St. Louis County, which closed at the end of 2022.

The Rush Island plant was used fairly sparingly in its later years — primarily as a “peaker” plant, when power demand was greatest.

Ameren said it intends for the new facility to play a similar role, “as a reliable backup source of energy,” with the gas plant designed to provide power when demand peaks on cold winter days, hot summer afternoons, and to support the grid when renewable generation is unavailable.

Meanwhile, the project’s energy storage component would do much of the same. For instance, the batteries could be charged when cheap, excess energy is on the grid and then used when needed, in any weather conditions.

“Fully charged, the entire array could power thousands of homes for hours and help overall grid reliability, especially during times of peak energy needs,” Ameren said in its announcement.

While the site offers plenty of existing attributes, such as its readymade transmission access, Ameren said that the Rush Island building could not be retrofitted to accommodate the new projects, and that its demolition is already underway.

Ameren still needs approval from state utility regulators before proceeding with its Big Hollow proposal, which it hopes to receive by March. The company then aims to complete the project by 2028.

The utility said that the estimated cost of the project is currently confidential.

‘About time’ for battery storage

Ameren’s plans for the Rush Island site’s redevelopment have elicited some mixed reactions from energy experts — and raised questions about costs.

For example, the company’s push to build new generation and aid grid reliability comes as it says it faces a wave of demand from prospective developers of highly energy-intensive projects, like data centers.

Utilities are fielding similar requests nationwide, although Missouri has not yet seen the explosions in energy demand that so far have been concentrated in scattershot places across the map, such as Virginia, Texas and North Dakota.

Predicting if or when that wave of demand could materialize in Missouri is one challenge that now confronts regional utilities and state regulators, raising questions about how to shoulder costs of energy projects that largely cater to heavy users, and carrying risks of a possible “overbuild” that leaves customers on the hook for hefty investments.

“The question is what supply should be built and how do you pay for it?” said Ashok Gupta, a Kansas City-based energy economist for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

While the payment question will eventually be part of the regulatory review process for Ameren’s Big Hollow proposal, it is also being broadly examined and debated in separate cases before the Missouri Public Service Commission. For example, outside groups and watchdog agencies that police utility spending will soon weigh in on cases about how to serve large-load customers seeking power from the state’s biggest electric utilities: Ameren and Kansas City-based Evergy.

Federal energy policy whiplash out of Washington now “makes the calculus even harder” in determining what to build and when to build it, Gupta said, as tax credits for wind and solar projects are now set to lapse within a couple years — projects that represent the bulk of new power generation in the U.S.

But costs at Big Hollow could at least partially be reduced by federal tax credits for battery storage projects. Unlike the tax credits for wind and solar, those for battery storage projects were spared the widespread cuts contained in the massive spending bill passed by Congressional Republicans this month, and signed by President Donald Trump.

Some, like Gupta, cheered the battery portion of the proposed project.

“It’s about time,” said Gupta, noting that storage can nicely complement renewable energy and smooth out issues with intermittent generation, whenever solar or wind generation stops or slows. “It’s exciting, it’s necessary.”

Ameren said its battery investment aligns with industry trends and that it can learn from other utilities that adopted the technology earlier.

“A lot of our peer utilities are investing heavily in batteries,” said Arora, the Ameren senior vice president. “The technology has matured.”

The proposed gas plant faces questions from some, for reasons beyond making a large financial investment in fossil fuels that contribute to climate change.

Gas has had issues with reliability and affordability at times, particularly in the extreme weather conditions when peaker plants are needed, as illustrated during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when gas plants faltered and fuel prices skyrocketed.

And building gas plants, themselves, has become considerably more expensive in recent years, with costs tripling amid high demand and long waits for gas turbines, said John Ketchum, the CEO of NextEra Energy, a giant Florida-based utility, at recent energy conferences in March and June.

Gupta, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, questioned Ameren’s choice to pursue a simple-cycle gas plant — a less efficient alternative than combined-cycle gas plants, which recover exhaust heat and use it to generate additional power.

“You’re gonna burn all this gas. Let’s get as much energy as possible,” Gupta said.

Ameren, though, said that simple-cycle plants are better for peaker plants, rather than those relied on for baseload power generation.

Some would also prefer to see more emphasis on energy efficiency, rather than focusing on building new power plants.

“The lowest-cost resource is still energy efficiency,” said Gupta. “We should be doing hundreds if not thousands of megawatts of energy efficiency to keep energy affordable.”

Filling the void

The proposed next chapter for the site would mark the coda to Rush Island’s unique — and criminal — background. Between 2007 and 2010, Ameren illegally modified the plant’s generators near the end of their intended lifespan without obtaining permits — enabling them to produce more energy and emit more air pollutants, and sparking a decade-plus lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice.

The plant was one of a dwindling number of U.S. coal plants that did not have widely adopted pollution controls, called scrubbers, that remove sulfur dioxide, or SO2, from emissions. Ameren’s biggest coal plant, the Labadie Energy Center west of St. Louis, also lacks scrubbers and emits far more SO2 than any other U.S. coal plant.

A judge in the marathon legal case over the plant’s air pollution sought to have the company offset Rush Island’s illegal SO2 emissions by reducing Labadie’s emissions by an equal amount. But an appeals court scrapped that order, saying that Ameren was never given notice of an alleged Clean Air Act violation at Labadie — despite the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency had issued “Notices of Violation” to the company about that very issue at Labadie, years ago.

The company ultimately reached an agreement to pay $61 million for electric school buses and charging equipment, as well as the distribution of air purifiers to residential customers, prioritizing low-income households.

The new plans for the site bring potential relief to local leaders dealing with lost tax revenue from Rush Island’s closure. For instance, the Jefferson R-VII School District will see a budget reduction of $1.1 million in the upcoming school year, thanks to the plant’s retirement.

“It’s a tough number to look at,” said David Haug, the district superintendent.

But the site’s planned redevelopment figures to eventually bring the money back. And it would provide longer-term certainty and stability compared to Rush Island, with Haug saying it felt as if the “clock was ticking” throughout the aging plant’s later years, as both the facility and the school district’s finances faced an unclear future.

“It was certainly a good day when we became aware that this was official,” Haug said. “This is a big, long-term win for the district.”

ByDan Gearino for Inside Climate News

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on July 7 that he said will “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources” such as wind and solar.

But it’s not clear whether the order will have much of an effect other than to underscore the president’s antipathy for those power sources. Some observers speculate this action is fulfilling a promise to hardline conservative House members in order to win their votes last week for the massive budget reconciliation bill.

The order is titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.” It directs the Treasury department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits” as specified by the bill.

The legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, says that projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027. This is a rapid phaseout compared to the previous law that had a phaseout that was to begin in 2032.

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines. It also says the department must take prompt action to follow the bill’s new limits on tax credits going to entities with ties to China.

In addition, it says the Department of the Interior must revise any policies or practices that give solar and wind power preferential treatment compared to other energy sources.

The Treasury and Interior departments also must make reports within 45 days about how they are complying with the order.

Analysts, lawmakers and officials from renewable energy industry groups had mixed reactions about the significance of the order.

But they do not downplay the effects of the bill that has become law. It is a gutting of incentives from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that will reduce federal government support for renewable energy, electric vehicles and manufacturing of those products and related components. The result, according to reports from Rhodium Group, Princeton University’s REPEAT Project, the think tank Energy Innovation and the Clean Energy Buyers Association, is likely to be a decrease in U.S. jobs and an increase in electricity prices.

And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.

“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email. “To state the obvious, only Congress can change tax law—which, in fact, is what Congress did last week via the budgetary megabill.”

He expects little or no practical effect from the Interior department provision

“It is worth noting that, under the Federal Power Act, the government cannot favor one type of power generation over another,” he said. “Thus, the EO simply restates existing law in that regard.”

Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate for BloombergNEF, sees much greater potential for harm to the wind and solar industries.

“It’s a big deal, but how big a deal it is we don’t know,” he said.

He explained that the order is attempting to create uncertainty around the 2026 deadline, which is a crucial deadline for projects to have a smooth path to qualifying for tax credits.

“It could push a lot of projects out of eligibility or into such an uncertain state of eligibility that it becomes hard to build and finance them,” he said.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, offered this statement:

“This executive order appears to target long-standing and well-established tax standards that allow for realistic financing timelines for all sorts of energy projects—including solar, wind, carbon capture and hydrogen projects,” she said. “We will continue to make the case that business certainty, predictability, and even-handedness are bedrocks of federal policy that cannot be undone by the stroke of a pen. We expect the Treasury Department to follow the law.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois), who has a background running clean energy businesses, said the order is about helping the market for fossil fuels by harming competing sources of electricity.

“Donald Trump doesn’t hate renewable energy because it is clean,” he said in an email. “He hates it because it’s cheap. His latest executive orders are about making it harder for Americans to access cheap and reliable energy to ensure he keeps profits up for his friends in the fossil fuel industry.”

Taylor Rogers, an assistant press secretary for Trump, pushed back on concerns that the president’s actions would lead to higher energy prices.

“No one takes disingenuous cost concerns seriously from ‘clean energy’ groups that supported a $200 billion tax hike on the American people to fund the Green New Scam,” she said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill will continue to unleash America’s energy industry, dropping electricity costs that increased dramatically due to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.”

She listed the many aspects of the bill that increase oil and gas production and reduce regulations, which she said will cut costs for consumers.

Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.

The budget bill passed the House on Friday, 218-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. Several fiscally conservative House members initially balked at the spending levels in the bill, but most of them ended up voting for it after meeting with Trump.

Asked about how Trump had earned their votes, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told CNBC on Friday that the president had told members he would use executive powers to stop renewable energy sources from being able to use subsidies.

“A lot of these subsidies won’t remain in effect from here on out,” Norman said.

He posted on Facebook on Tuesday that the order was “a pledge [Trump] had made, and one he kept.”

He added, “I proudly support an all-of-the-above energy approach—ensuring coal, gas, nuclear, hydropower, and yes, responsibly advanced renewables can compete in an honest market. THIS is how you make energy policy work for everyday Americans, not special interests.”

It’s not much of a stretch to see a connection between Norman’s comment on CNBC and the executive order, said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that works to expand access to rooftop solar.

“I assume that this is the direct response to that promise,” he said.

He said it’s difficult to predict the ramifications of the order without knowing how federal agencies will choose to respond.

“It all depends on how Treasury interprets the guidance. It could be nothing. It could be a lot,” he said.

Brand believes the order’s intent was to increase uncertainty and discourage companies from using the tax credits, which it may succeed in doing even if it doesn’t lead to any substantive changes in the way the credits work.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1455382/story_image/AP23060767877666.jpg?1752268392,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:08.837595

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes.
While there are nuances to the rule changes proposed by each of these federal agencies, there are a few through-lines as the agencies comply with recent executive orders, laws and Supreme Court decisions.

This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews.","Multiple federal agencies have rolled out new rules for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, as the Trump administration aims to expedite environmental reviews.

However, environmental groups warn the changes could erode the act’s intended purpose and safeguards around government decision making.

NEPA was signed into law in 1970, requiring federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of proposed actions such as issuing development permits, adopting federal land management actions, building highways and publicly-owned facilities and more.

The latest agency changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to ensure “environmental reviews cannot be weaponized to stall the growth of the American economy or halt energy infrastructure construction,” according to a June 30 memo from the White House .

These reforms follow a withdrawal of the Council on Environmental Quality’s authority, as ordered by the executive order to increase domestic energy production. The council, which was created at the same time as NEPA, historically has created a default set of regulations for agencies to adopt or build upon.

In the spring, the council pulled back its authority and rescinded its regulations . While many agencies already had their own NEPA regulations, this wholly shifted the responsibility to individual federal departments.

As of June 30, eight federal agencies published proposed NEPA regulation updates to the Federal Register, opening up a 30-day public comment period for the changes. This includes the U.S. departments of agriculture, commerce, interior, energy, transportation and defense as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

While there are nuances to the rule changes proposed by each of these federal agencies, there are a few through-lines as the agencies comply with recent executive orders, laws and Supreme Court decisions.

This includes deadlines and page limits for environmental reviews meant to expedite NEPA processes and reduce costs, some of which were prescribed through the ​​Fiscal Responsibility Act’s BUILDER Act amendments under the Biden administration in 2023 .

Additional changes around what actions and effects are subject to review lean on the May Supreme Court ruling regarding the proposed 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway narrowed the scope of what environmental impacts an agency is required to analyze under NEPA.

In the case, the plaintiffs (Eagle County and five environmental groups) argued that the review of the railway failed to study downstream impacts such as how increased rail traffic would impact wildfire risk and impacts on water resources and other biological resources.

The Supreme Court ruled that NEPA was “purely procedural” and agencies don’t have to study these up and downstream impacts and put the onus on agencies to determine the scope of analysis required for projects.

Both the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior ‘s interim final rules indicate the changes will get back to NEPA’s procedural roots and make reviews “faster, more flexible and more efficient” as guided by this court decision and other recent regulations and directives including Trump’s domestic energy executive orders, which gave guidance to expedite and simply NEPA processes.

One thing the Department of Agriculture is proposing to increase efficiency is to issue a uniform set of procedures for all agencies under it, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency and four more. The interim rule proposes rescinding all the individual regulations previously held by these agencies.

In a statement , Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the permitting process “has been abused for decades to block affordable, reliable energy production, delay critical infrastructure projects and stunt America’s economy,” lauding the revised NEPA procedures as a fix of the system.

Melissa Simpson, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas trade group that represents Colorado and 12 other Western states, applauded the NEPA changes proposed as a “major step in removing roadblocks and spurring capital investments in American energy and infrastructure.”

Environmental advocates argue NEPA reforms will diminish act, public input

Ronni Flannery, senior staff attorney with The Wilderness Society, said the national environmental nonprofit is still combing through the various proposals, but sees some concerning themes.

“One thing that sort of strikes us is that there’s likely to be a lot of inconsistency in how these various provisions are applied, which means confusion among the regulated parties and just some challenges there,” Flannery said. “It certainly is a significant departure from what has operated as the rules of the game up till this point.”

While The Wilderness Society was supportive of some of the NEPA permitting reforms passed under Biden, other actions by the Trump administration and Republicans have signaled concerns for what the proposals will actually do. Part of this is that the Biden reforms included resource allocations to help agencies conduct NEPA reviews.

“Congress has now revoked resources and dollars that were earmarked for helping the agencies staff up and make sure that their environmental review processes and permitting processes are efficient and so that there’s adequate staffing,” Flannery said, adding that this will make it more difficult for agencies to conduct these environmental reviews.

A 2022 research study , which studied over 41,000 NEPA decisions completed by the U.S. Forest Service — which conducts more environmental impact statements than any other federal agency — between 2004 and 2020, concluded that delays in the permitting process were most often attributed to staff turnover, inadequate budgets, delays in receiving information from applications and more.

The study noted that these statements represent less than 1% of all NEPA decisions, but that data on other decisions is limited.

In addition to these reforms, Republicans included a “pay-to-play” provision for NEPA in Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which was signed into law last week. This allows for project sponsors, including private entities, to pay for expedited environmental reviews. (A previous provision that would have also allowed entities paying the fee to avoid any judicial review of projects was removed from the final bill.)

These types of expeditious environmental reviews not only follow the administration’s effort to prioritize profit over people and shut out public input, but erode the protections NEPA offers, Flannery argued.

Already, there have been examples of “projects moving through the process at warp speed,” Flannery said.

This includes the Bureau of Land Management’s decision to expedite review of a proposal to increase oil transport out of the Uinta Basin in Utah — which Colorado lawmakers criticized — as well as a Bureau approved uranium mine expansion in southeast Utah , which was the first project to go forward with Trump’s expedited 14-day environmental review process that excluded public, input.

On the whole, Flannery said that in effect, these reforms and the administration, are “shutting the public out of government decision-making on decisions that impact the public and our national lands and waters.”

Public input, Flannery argued, is a key tenant of the environmental policy, also pointing to a 2025 study from the University of Arizona , which concluded that public comment on environmental impact statements influences outcomes and often results in substantive changes in federal agency decision making.

“NEPA was always intended to ensure that the government takes a close look at the health and environmental impacts of their actions and cumulatively,” Flannery said. “What we’re seeing from the administration and from some acts of Congress, is the severe eroding of these protections and the ability of the public to not only understand what the government is doing, but also to weigh in, express concerns and help influence the process to make sure that communities are protected.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2017/06/04221025/ROAN_1_8-24-1240x854.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:37.705701

The move may even impact Jeep Wrangler sales; the popular 4xe hybrid model had been eligible for the full $7,500 credit.

Fortunately, if you're in the market for an EV, the federal tax credit is not going away immediately. Buyers can still take advantage of it if they take delivery before Sept. 30, 2025. Several EVs and plug-in hybrids meet the criteria for federal tax credit eligibility. Here are ten that you should consider buying before the tax credit gets eliminated in September.

All on this list are eligible for the full $7,500 federal tax credit until Sept. 30, 2025. We sourced performance data from manufacturer websites and EV range data from the EPA.

10 Acura ZDX

Acura revived the ZDX nameplate for its first EV. It's a midsize crossover, and like its Honda Prologue sibling, the ZDX runs on GM's Ultium platform that underpins the Chevrolet Blazer EV. It offers up to 500 horsepower, in Type S guise, and up to 313 miles of EV range.

Acura ZDX Specs

The ZDX starts at an MSRP of $64,500 for the rear-wheel-drive base model. The AWD version starts at $68,500, and the Type S begins at $73,500. So, all ZDX trims are currently below the $80,000 threshold to be eligible for the federal tax credit. Tax credits had potentially been pushing the price below that of the Honda CR-V hybrid.

9 Cadillac Lyriq

The Lyriq is Cadillac's first fully electric vehicle. It's a midsize crossover, and like the Acura above, it also uses the GM Ultium platform. The Lyriq offers up to 326 miles of range in single-motor and 319 miles of range in dual-motor AWD form. Buyers can level up to a 500 horsepower version.

Cadillac Lyriq Specs

The Lyriq has been a strong seller for Cadillac, thanks in part to the federal tax credit. All Lyriq trims are currently eligible for this, but it's not the only Caddy, as the new new three-row Visitiq crossover also squeezes in below the threshold in it's base configuration.

8 Chevy Equinox EV

The Chevrolet Equinox EV is not the sexiest electric vehicle on the market, but the compact crossover does deliver perhaps the best range for dollar spent value offer in the affordable realm. The Equinox offers 319 miles of EV range, which is impressive for a base trim starting at $33,600.

Chevrolet Equinox EV Specs

The Equinox EV is eligible to receive the full $7,500 federal tax credit. That can bring the base price down to an effective $26,100, bringing every Equinox EV trim below $40,000. The tax credit has also helped Chevrolet offer affordable, sub-$300/month lease deals. The federal tax credit also affects the Blazer EV and certain Silverado EV configurations.

7 Ford F-150 Lightning

The Ford F-150 pickup is America's most popular vehicle, so the automaker wanted to recreate that in the electric realm. Thus, the Blue Oval released the F-150 Lightning, which is, quite literally, an F-150 that happens to be electric. It offers up to 580 hp, 775 lb-ft of torque, and 320 miles of range with the Extended Range battery. It can also serve as a backup generator for your home, thoughthis does require a pricey home power setup.

Ford F-150 Lightning Specs

The F-150 Lightning starts at $54,780. However, buyers must upgrade to the $69,995 Flash trim to get an extended-range battery pack. All F-150 Lightning trims below Platinum are eligible for the federal tax credit, and Ford has been relaying that full credit to customers to bring the F-150 Lightning's costs down.

6 Genesis Electrified GV70

The Genesis Electrified GV70 isn't the most elegant name for an EV, or any car really. But if you can overlook that, it's a seriously impressive package. It resembles the standard GV70, especially since there is EV badging, but it does feature a faux grille. Although it rides on a different platform, it still utilizes the same electric motors and 350 kW fast-charging technology found in other Hyundai group EVs. It packs 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and that's before you send it into boost mode.

Genesis Electrified GV70 Specs

The Electrified GV70 starts at $64,380 MSRP with the base AWD trim. Buyers can level up to the Prestige AWD for $75,350. All trims are eligible for the federal tax credit, which keeps the base MSRP under $60,000.

5 Honda Prologue

We've already mentioned the Honda Prologue, so you might remember that it is a midsize electric crossover that rides on GM's Ultium crossover platform. The Prologue borrows some design language from the Civic. It has dramatically less power, though, topping out at 288 hp in AWD spec, but it can deliver up to 308 miles of range in FWD form.

Honda Prologue Specs

The Prologue starts at $47,400 and tops out with the $57,900 Elite trim. So, all versions are eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. Affordability has been a key part of the EV's appeal, as it can bring the effective cost of even the most expensive Prologue trims under $55,000.

4 Hyundai Ioniq 5

The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a former World Car of the Year Award winner and one of the best all-around EVs on the market, with a combination of style, practicality, and advanced EV tech. The 2025 refresh introduces a larger 84-kWh battery pack, offering up to 318 miles of range in RWD and 290 miles in AWD, along with helpful additions such as a rear wiper. And it can deliver up to 641 hp in bursts with the Ioniq 5 N version.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 Specs

The Ioniq 5 starts at $42,600 for the SE Standard Range base model. However, most buyers will opt for the $46,650 SE version with the larger battery pack. The federal tax credit, eligible for all Ioniq 5 trims, can push the base price below $40,000. Hyundai has also been using the credit to offer affordable lease deals.

3 Kia EV6

The Kia EV6 shares the E-GMP platform and electric motors with the Ioniq 5. Kia opted for a sleek and sporty style over a retro-futuristic one, so the EV6 is a bit more wagon-like in its design than the Ioniq 5's hatchback shape. The EV6 offers up to 319 miles of range in RWD and 295 miles in AWD. The 577-hp EV6 GT can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds.

Kia EV6 Specs

The EV6 starts at $42,900. Trims range up to $63,800 for the EV6 GT model. All trims are eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, which can bring the base price to $35,400. Kia has been using the federal tax credit to pass on outstanding lease deals to customers as part of a bid to boost sales.

2 Kia EV9

The EV market needed an affordable, three-row family crossover, and Kia delivered it with the World Car of the Year Award-winning EV9. This model delivers stately and rugged style, performance (up to 379 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque), and the Hyundai E-GMP platform's class-leading charging tech. It can seat up to seven passengers or offer more than 80 cubic feet of cargo space. Kia is set to level things up even further with the EV9 GT.

Kia EV9 Specs

The Kia EV9 starts at $54,900 MSRP, which can be pushed below $50,000 using the federal tax credit. Kia has also been using the federal tax credit to offer affordable EV9 lease deals.

1 Tesla Model Y

The Model Y is Tesla's smaller crossover. It offers the same combination of range (up to 357 miles), style, and affordability as the Model 3, but in the crossover body style that most buyers prefer. And it has become the best-selling Tesla and best-selling EV by a wide margin. It was America's fourth best-selling overall vehicle in 2024, with more than 400,000 units sold. And it just received an overhaul for 2025.

Tesla Model Y Specs

Tesla has used the federal tax credit to keep the Model Y very affordable. The starting price currently sits at $44,900 MSRP for the RWD model and $48,900 for the AWD model. This brings both cars under $42,000 with the federal tax credit factored in. Every Tesla Model 3 and non-Cyberbeast Cybertruck is potentially eligible for the federal tax credit.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10-evs-you-should-buy-before-trump-s-big-beautiful-bill-comes-into-effect.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:21:11.028297

Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time could also claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S.-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which are all headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 13:08:00.901041

Ltd. has announced a major initiative to deploy a network of advanced EV charging hubs across the state’s challenging mountainous terrain.

As per the firm's statement, EzUrja’s highway charging hubs will initially feature 60 EV chargers catering to all vehicle types. Each hub will offer not only fast charging but also restrooms, food outlets, and digital engagement areas, creating a pit stop experience for travellers.

The company’s 'E-Way Hubs' are designed specifically for the hill state's roads, bringing highway charging, mobile EV solutions, and locally manufactured, weatherproof chargers to tourist routes and green corridors. The move aligns with Himachal’s ambitious roadmap of achieving 15 percent EV sales by 2025 and 100 percent by 2030, which has already seen the registration of over 5,000 EVs and approval for 402 charging stations across key routes and government facilities.

""Electric mobility in mountainous terrain requires more than just charging as it needs innovation, uninterrupted charging services, comfort halting and a deep understanding of local and climatic challenges. That’s exactly what we bring,"" said Rohit Agarwal, Spokesperson at EzUrja. ""Our solutions are made in Himachal, for Himachal, weather- proof, terrain-ready, to be powered by green energy from the State. By manufacturing locally and innovating for local needs, we are aligning with Himachal Pradesh’s environmental and economic goals,"" he noted.

The company is also leveraging its EV hub experience in Kolkata to introduce mobile charging units and microgrid-integrated hubs for remote and underserved areas in Himachal. These solutions are expected to help ease range anxiety, especially along tourism circuits and national highways like the Shimla-Chamba route, recently declared a green corridor by the state.

“With locally built technology, we are creating jobs and green industrial growth within the state,” said Ashhok Kapoor, Managing Director, EzUrja Group. “Himachal’s leadership in clean energy is commendable, and we’re proud to contribute to making sustainable mobility scalable, even in the remotest valleys,"" he noted.

As per the firm, hilly regions like Himachal Pradesh pose unique challenges for EV adoption, ranging from steeper power consumption during uphill driving to a lack of reliable highway charging access. EzUrja is addressing these hurdles through targeted initiatives that align seamlessly with the government’s green mobility vision, starting with the green corridor highway connecting Shimla to Chamba.

Despite countries pivoting and investing in clean energy sources in the last decade, global greenhouse gas emissions still hit new highs in 2023.

This infographic ranks the top 15 countries by carbon emissions, based on 2023 data from The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. It shows national-level greenhouse gas emissions in gigatonnes of CO₂ equivalent (GtCO₂e).

Together, these nations account for nearly 80% of global emissions.

China vs the World: Carbon Emissions Edition

China leads the world in emissions with 15.9 GtCO₂e, representing 30.1% of the global total in 2023.

This reflects its role as the world’s manufacturing hub, with heavy reliance on coal and high industrial output.

In fact, China’s share of global manufacturing is also about the same (27%) showing the direct consequence of becoming the world’s production base.

The country has committed to peaking emissions before 2030, but its growth trajectory poses challenges.

This also means any progress on climate will hinge heavily both on China’s policy decisions and global consumer behavior.

U.S. and India Round Out the Top Three Carbon Emissions

The U.S. is the second-largest emitter at 6.0 GtCO₂e (11.3% of global emissions).

And this is with around 330 million people, or one-fourth of China’s population. It’s per capita emissions (15 tCO₂e) is also top-15 in the world.

In stark contrast, India ranks third with 4.1 GtCO₂e (7.8%), lower than the U.S., with four times the number of people. However, its emissions are rising as its economy and population grow, following a similar path Western industrialized countries took to prosperity.

Smaller Countries with Outsized Carbon Emissions

Nations like Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Canada appear further down the list, but have some of the highest per capita emissions globally.

Their rankings reflect both resource-driven economies and energy-intensive lifestyles.

Meanwhile, countries like Brazil and Indonesia have large emissions tied to economic development, deforestation, and land use.

Funky Design, Affordable Features Up close, the Super EV looks just as adorable and funky as it did in Honda's shots.","Honda has brought some very interesting hardware to the Goodwood Festival of Speed this year. But lurking between every generation of Civic Type-R, and the championship-winning 1986 Williams Honda F1 car is something small, mysterious, and that has our full attention. It's called the Super EV concept, and Honda isn't saying much about it.

The little electric has already been getting real-world testing in the UK, complete with that quirky and delightful purple camouflage. Honda wants to bring it to market around the world, and it could make the perfect replacement for the already-missed Honda e. One that might be a lot easier to sell than that tech-heavy electric. Now we've finally gotten up close and personal with the Super Honda.

Super EV's First In-Person Appearance

Our first look at the Super EV came a month ago. Honda launched a teaser campaign for the vehicles it planned to bring to Goodwood, and while the robot lawnmower and the production Prelude were neat, it was the tiny purple box in front of the Palace of Westminster that really grabbed our eyeballs.

Yes, it's just another tiny electric city car. There's only so much an automaker can do with that footprint, but somehow Honda has given this a load of character. Even though we can't even really see the bodywork, this little car screams fun. Well, more like shouts fun quietly but adorably.

Honda called it an ""all-electric urban concept vehicle."" Now it is saying the car ""realizes both practical usability and the 'joy of driving' only Honda can offer.""

Check out those TE37s. This is proof positive that the design works on anything, at least anything built after about 1975. They're a 16-inch size, which is delightfully compact. No, we don't think a production car will use this wheel, but we can dream, right?

Funky Design, Affordable Features

Up close, the Super EV looks just as adorable and funky as it did in Honda's shots. We can see more of it now, too, including just how boxy those arches are, the cuts in the doorlines, and the Honda badge in the nose. Honda is hiding the interior away from us, sadly, but that's probably because it's an early prototype.

Honda's also hiding many of the details, but we did manage to get them to admit it's front-wheel drive with a single electric motor, will be a direct successor to the Honda e, and will be far more affordable. Things like the conventional door mirrors are key in achieving that affordable price point, although the exact figure Honda is targeting is still a secret.

Why does Honda think this one could work when the Honda e couldn't? This car looks like it will be more cost-effective than the e. While that other Honda was another adorable electric, it was loaded with high-tech and expensive goodies. Cameras instead of side mirrors, for example, and screens that ran from pillar to pillar inside the cabin. And yes, those are rear drum brakes. On a car this size, it doesn't matter. Regen does most of the work, and drums are cheaper. Even some Audi EV models that cost tens of thousands more have rear drums for exactly those reasons.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/honda-super-ev-concept-goodwood-3.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:35.539924

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.
This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.
In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects.
“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright has heard a lot of doomsday predictions about the rollback of wind and solar subsidies in President Trump’s sweeping tax cut bill.

He has one simple answer: “They’re just wrong.”

Mr. Wright, a former fracking executive with roots in solar and geothermal, said intermittent renewables are a costly impediment on the nation’s electrical grid, and the sooner they are replaced by reliable sources such as natural gas, coal or nuclear, the faster costs will come down.

“If you look at the places that have spent the most subsidies and built the largest amount of wind and solar, the more cheap energy you put on our grid, the more expensive the grid becomes,” Mr. Wright said in an interview with The Washington Times.

The cost of cutting taxes in Mr. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill is paid for in part by axing a slate of subsidies for green energy projects, including wind and solar, by 2026.

The elimination of the renewable subsidies, the Joint Committee on Taxation determined, will save nearly $500 billion over ten years.

But opponents warn it will kill jobs, hike energy bills and ultimately weaken the power grid by discouraging future wind and solar projects, which will slow the growth of grid capacity as demand rises. Or, they warn, solar and wind projects will move ahead but at a higher, unsubsidized cost that will be passed along to ratepayers.

Sen. Ron Wyden, who authored many of the tax subsidies, called the cuts “an outright massacre” for wind and solar.

“Not only will hundreds of thousands of Americans who work in clean energy lose their jobs right away, individual families and businesses of all sizes nationwide will get clobbered with higher utility bills,” the Oregon Democrat said.

The media coverage has been overwhelmingly dire, honing in on states like Minnesota, which have invested heavily in wind and solar projects, and turning to clean energy advocates for assessments on how these states will be impacted by the cuts.

San Francisco-based Energy Innovation, which advocates for ending fossil fuels, calculated that subsidy cuts would increase annual energy bills in Minnesota households by $6 billion between 2025 and 2034.

“This is due to higher dependence on fossil fuels and higher fossil fuel prices,” the organization wrote in an analysis of the legislation.

Mr. Wright said the wind and solar projects have produced “more expensive electricity,” incentivized by lucrative government subsidies.

Natural gas, he said, “is just by far and away, the cheapest source of electricity today.”

California, for example, ditched coal and natural gas for wind and solar, and imports its renewable power from Utah and Nevada, among other states. Florida went in the opposite direction, investing in the construction of natural gas pipelines.

“California’s electricity prices today are twice as high as Florida’s. California has by far the largest population of any state in the country. They produce less electricity than Florida does,” said the energy secretary.

On average, the cost of onshore wind and solar is cheaper than fossil fuels, but they only produce power some of the time and require nuclear, coal and natural gas to rev up at night, when it’s cloudy or when the wind is not blowing. This intermittent use raises the cost of energy, Mr. Wright said.

Wind turbines and solar arrays take up more land than non-renewable energy plants and require new transmission lines.

“You really have to maintain two grids,” Mr. Wright said. “When it’s the middle of the day, when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, all the other plants have to turn down to accommodate the wind and sun. Then they’ve got to be turned back up. And that is not an efficient way to run huge machinery. You have to operate your existing grid less efficiently than before, and you have to pay for a second grid.”

Mr. Wright said the tax cut legislation will steer states away from adding renewables to the grid and drive them to build reliable sources that run all the time.

“You still have the ability to generate electricity in all these states. They’re just not going to keep adding to that secondary, parasitic, more expensive grid,” he said.

In Minnesota, subsidized costs of wind and solar climbed even after passage of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which implemented many of the tax credits for new renewable projects now targeted for elimination in Mr. Trump’s bill.

More than a third of the state’s energy is produced by renewables. A state law requires utilities to produce 100% of their electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2040.

The Center of the American Experiment, a conservative think tank in Minnesota, found that rising wind and solar prices have made them the most expensive sources of electricity in the state “by a substantial margin.”

It calculated that electricity produced by new wind projects costs twice as much as electricity from existing coal plants.

The cost of electricity from new solar projects in the state was triple the cost generated by existing coal plants, the group found. It blamed rising prices for wind turbines and solar panels.

Many states have shifted to renewables to reduce emissions and convert to clean energy produced by solar and wind.

In Connecticut, a significant portion of rising consumer electric bills is dedicated to funding green energy projects. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law in 2022 mandating that the state achieve a zero-carbon electrical grid by 2040.

The ambitious plan is blamed in part for the state’s skyrocketing energy bills, although green energy groups say the real blame lies with global warming, which they say has caused extreme weather events and ultra-hot summers.

Mr. Wright said Mr. Trump’s January executive order blocking most new offshore wind projects along the eastern seaboard will spare Connecticut ratepayers even higher utility bills in the future.

Offshore wind is one of the most expensive forms of energy on the planet, he said.

Connecticut energy bills are among the highest in the nation and were expected to increase when the offshore wind projects went online. Eversource, a main provider of power in New England, projected offshore wind would cost nearly $100 per megawatt hour, which is almost double the cost of energy provided by the state’s Millstone Nuclear Power Plant.

“They are going to be saved the outrageous costs from the additional offshore wind,” Mr. Wright said.

Mr. Wright said the high energy costs in the northeast will be reduced by the Trump administration’s revival of a natural gas pipeline project extending from the Marcellus Shale gas fields in northern Pennsylvania to New York and into markets in New England, where consumers pay the highest electricity rates in the nation.

“New England has expensive energy for choices, and the biggest choice they’ve made is just to not have enough connection to the natural gas pipeline network,” he said.

Critics warn that if states abandon solar and wind for natural gas, it would take several years for the permitting and construction of new natural gas plants and much longer to build nuclear power plants. This could leave electrical grids without enough energy and consumers on the hook for higher prices.

Mr. Wright said states will have to change regulations to allow for the expansion of natural gas, which could happen faster now that subsidies for wind and solar are headed for a quick phase-out under the new tax cut law and Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

“Ultimately, if they don’t build all the offshore wind and all that, you’ll probably see an expansion in natural gas-generated electricity,” he said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/02/Alaska_Trump_Energy_Oil_Field_Tour_13733_c0-207-4964-3102_s1200x700.jpg?05818a1aae4a18625e6d2f3787522970c4e058bd,N,,2025-07-13 11:18:45.020922

If you have to build one then it's way longer. All this chaos is costing us jobs. Companies that don't feel safe to invest are canceling programs due to uncertainty. Then they're laying people off due to lack of work.

President cheetoh mussolini is setting us back by decades. The only thing saving the US auto industry rigjt now is the tarriffs on Chinese EVs. If it weren't for them the big 3 would be toast.

EVs are priced taking the tax credit into account, and with huge margins in comparison to ICE cars, so I wouldn't be surprised if out the door prices end up being more or less the same after the credit goes away. The cost of LFP batteries is projected to drop to $50 a kwh by the end of 2025, which means EVs will hit manufacturing cost parity with ICE cars.

Also tired of the myth that most EV user are hanging out waiting for their car to charged. It almost universally comes from a ICE driver who never tried an EV. I'll admit EVs still have a ways to go for apartment dwellers or people without access to overnight or work charging, but for many homeowners, we spend less time at charging stations than you spend at the gas station.

Here's a scenario. I used to fill up 1-2x per week in my ATS. I drove a lot, about 20k a year. I recently got an EV. I upped my driving even more and now i'm driving 24k a year. In one entire year, i spent 18 minutes total at supercharger stations. The rest was simply plugging my car in while it sit and while i sleep in my driveway. I think homeowners(or anyone with easy access to overnight charging) should think of it this way, ""If i left every morning with 3/4 tank, how often would I need to visit the gas station"". For me the answer to that was 2x the whole year. I imagine for most people that would be between 4-8x per year.

A lot of ICE owners try to think of things like you need to go out of your way to charge and you need to wait until you're empty to start charging, but you don't charge like that

EVs were taking off and the infrastructure was coming very soon at the previous rate.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.","(AP) — Millions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time could also claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.

The new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.

Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:

Candidate Trump promised an auto loan interest tax break

Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”

The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.

The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.

The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.

Millions of buyers could benefit, but millions of others will not

U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.

After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

It’s the assembly plant, not the automaker’s headquarters that matters

The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.

Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.

General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.

Taxpayers could save hundreds of dollars a year

The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.

At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.

Some people also could see a reduction in state income taxes

Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.

On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. That’s an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer’s federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.

The verdict is out on whether the tax break will boost sales

At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer’s website.

A website ribbon exclaims: “CAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE” while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump’s tax-cut law.

“I think it’s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,” Ray said.

Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: “For some people deciding — should I buy it, should I not — this could be something that tips the scale.”

Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke’s math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month’s loan payment for a new vehicle.

“I don’t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,” Smoke said. “But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.”",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/07/AP25191678216150-e1752413902118.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:32.298693

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency.","The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) revolution hinges on one critical factor: domestic control of critical minerals like lithium. Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass Project in Nevada is now the linchpin of this ambition, combining secured funding, strategic partnerships, and federal incentives to position the U.S. as a self-sufficient player in the lithium supply chain. With construction ramping up and a 2027 operational target, investors are presented with a rare opportunity to profit from the intersection of energy independence, EV demand, and geopolitical risk mitigation.

The Funding Firewall: DOE Loans and Private Investments Secure the Supply Chain

Thacker Pass is no longer a speculative project—it is a fully funded, shovel-ready juggernaut. The $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), approved under the Biden administration's Critical Mineral Strategy, will see its first draw in Q3 2025, with the remaining funds staged to cover construction through 2027. This public backing is paired with a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners, which closed in April 2025, and a $100 million cash infusion from General Motors (GM). Together, these moves have created a funding “firewall” to shield the project from market volatility and geopolitical disruptions.

The DOE's involvement is particularly critical. The loan includes terms requiring domestic content for equipment and labor, directly aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. Lithium Americas' focus on local jobs—2,000 direct construction roles—and partnerships with the North America Building Trades Unions ensure compliance while bolstering U.S. manufacturing ecosystems.

GM's Stake: A Direct Pipeline to EV Demand

GM's 38% equity stake in Thacker Pass is more than a financial bet—it's a strategic play for EV supply chain dominance. The automaker has secured a 20-year offtake agreement for 100% of Phase 1's 40,000-tonne lithium carbonate output, enough to power 800,000 EVs annually. This partnership eliminates middlemen, reducing costs by 15-20% compared to spot-market lithium procurement.

For investors, GM's involvement is a guarantee of demand. As EV sales grow at a 25%+ CAGR through 2030, Thacker Pass's production will directly feed into GM's battery factories (e.g., Ultium Cells' $7 billion investment in Ohio). This symbiosis positions Lithium Americas as a de-risked play on EV adoption, insulated from lithium price swings through long-term pricing agreements.

The IRA Multiplier Effect: Tax Credits and Geopolitical Risk Mitigation

The Inflation Reduction Act's $30 billion in clean energy incentives supercharges Thacker Pass's value. Lithium Americas qualifies for IRA credits tied to domestic production, including:

- 40% investment tax credit for facilities using union labor and local materials.

- Battery credits for EVs using U.S.-sourced lithium, which could add $1,500–$7,500 per vehicle in subsidies for GM.

These incentives create a virtuous cycle: Thacker Pass's lithium enables U.S.-made EVs to claim IRA credits, while the IRA's tax breaks lower project costs. Meanwhile, the project's proximity to Nevada's “Lithium Loop” (from mining to recycling) ensures it becomes a hub for domestic battery supply chains, reducing reliance on Chinese lithium refining.

Timeline and Risk Mitigation: A 2027 Milestone with Safeguards

Construction is on track to meet its late 2027 completion target, with:

- 60% of engineering already complete (90% expected by year-end).

- Structural steel fabrication underway, with first installations in September 2025.

- Risk mitigation via a limestone quarry (to cut costs) and a 75% local cost base (labor/services), minimizing tariff exposure.

While regulatory risks linger (e.g., tribal land disputes), the project has secured permits and court rulings supporting its path forward. Lithium Americas' cash reserves ($446.9M as of March 2025) provide further financial cushioning.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip Before 2027's Payoff

Lithium Americas' stock (LAC) has underperformed lithium peers recently, reflecting near-term losses from construction costs. However, the 2027 operational ramp-up is the inflection point. Key catalysts include:

1. Q3 2025 DOE Loan Draw: Signals execution strength.

2. 2026 Earthworks Completion: A physical milestone for investors.

3. GM's Production Ramp: Lithium sales will begin flowing into earnings by 2028.

Investment Strategy:

- Buy on dips below $5.50/share (current ~$6.20), targeting a 2027 valuation of $10–12/share.

- Hold for the long term: Thacker Pass's 40+ year mine life and expansion potential (up to 100,000 tpa) create multi-decade earnings growth.

- Consider options or ETNs: Lithium ETFs (e.g., LIT) offer diversification but lack the pure-play upside of LAC.

Conclusion: A Lithium Cornerstone for the EV Age

Thacker Pass is not just a mine—it's the first nail in the coffin of U.S. lithium dependency. With GM's demand locked in, DOE's financial and regulatory backing, and IRA incentives turbocharging returns, this project is a generational investment. For those willing to look past short-term volatility, the path to 2027—and dominance of the EV supply chain—is clear.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:07:52.880373

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate.","Investors in Enbridge (ENB) face a classic conundrum: a company with a fortress-like balance sheet and a pipeline of regulated, cash-generating projects is currently trading at valuation levels that reflect little margin for error. While near-term risks—elevated debt, regulatory uncertainty, and overperformance—loom large, the stock's intrinsic value is underpinned by structural tailwinds. For income investors, the math remains compelling, but momentum traders should tread carefully.

The Near-Term Crosscurrents: Debt, Valuation, and Regulatory Overhang

Enbridge's debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.9x (as of Q1 2025) has drawn scrutiny, particularly as the metric includes partial contributions from recently acquired U.S. gas utilities. Management expects the ratio to improve toward its 4.5–5.0x target range as these assets contribute fully in 2025. However, the company's $2.8 billion in February 2025 senior note issuances—spanning 3-year to 30-year maturities—highlight its reliance on debt markets to fund growth.

Meanwhile, Enbridge's valuation metrics have stretched. At a trailing P/E of ~18x (vs. its 5-year average of 15x), the stock trades at a premium to peers like Kinder Morgan (KMI) and TC Energy (TRP). This premium reflects investor optimism about its $28 billion secured growth backlog, but it leaves little room for missteps. A misfire on regulatory approvals or a delay in projects like the Traverse Pipeline (pending permits for its 1.8 Bcf/d capacity expansion) could trigger a reassessment.

Regulatory risks remain a wildcard. In Canada, the newly elected government's stance on energy infrastructure—particularly the contentious Alberta-to-Prince Rupert pipeline—could introduce headwinds. In the U.S., state-level rate cases in North Carolina and Utah underscore the need for disciplined regulatory engagement to protect margins.

The Long-Term Case: Moats, Cash Flows, and Dividend Resilience

Despite these near-term headwinds, Enbridge's core strengths remain intact. Its Mainline expansion, a cornerstone of its growth strategy, is progressing steadily. The pipeline's record Q1 throughput of 3.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) signals strong demand from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which Enbridge expects to grow by ~1 mbpd by 2035. Phase 1 of the Mainline Optimization—leveraging 150 kbpd of incremental capacity on the Flanagan South Pipeline—bolsters this narrative.

The company's regulated asset base—including its U.S. gas utilities and Canadian distribution networks—provides a predictable earnings stream. Regulated projects like the Birch Grove expansion (adding $400 million to the backlog) and the Traverse Pipeline are underpinned by cost-of-service models, shielding cash flows from commodity price volatility.

Crucially, Enbridge's dividend resilience remains a pillar of its appeal. With a 5-year average dividend growth rate of ~2%, the stock's ~5.8% dividend yield (as of July 2025) offers income investors a cushion against short-term price fluctuations. Management's reaffirmed 2025 DCF guidance ($5.50–$5.90 per share) underscores confidence in its ability to fund payouts even amid macro challenges.

Investment Strategy: Hold for Income, Avoid Momentum Plays

For income investors, Enbridge's combination of a high yield, stable cash flows, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy makes it a compelling buy-and-hold candidate. The stock's ~7–9% EBITDA growth through 2026 and its long-term 5% annual growth trajectory post-2026 suggest that total shareholder returns (TSR) will outpace short-term volatility.

However, momentum traders face a tougher calculus. The stock's ~18% YTD return in 2025 (as of July) has compressed its valuation cushion. Near-term catalysts—including regulatory outcomes for the Traverse Pipeline and the Southern Illinois Connector's open season results—could lead to sharp price swings. Without a catalyst to justify further upside, the risk-reward tilts toward caution.

The world's first intelligent grid-forming photovoltaic and energy storage power station, tailored for ultra-high altitudes, low-temperatures and weak-grid scenarios, has been connected to the grid in Ngari Prefecture, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region.

In a landscape with an average altitude of about 4,700 meters, this pioneering energy storage system developed by tech giant Huawei, based in south China's Shenzhen, has rewritten the rules of power delivery in extreme conditions.

Situated on the edge of the region's power grid, Ngari has a high proportion of new energy installations but a weak grid -- connected to the main grid 500 kilometers away via a single 110-kilovolt line.

A 30MW solar power project's output was previously capped at 1.5MW. Moreover, equipment cooling and operation are hampered by air pressure and thin oxygen. The innovative new battery system, notably, has stepped in where conventional power solutions have fallen short.

As an engineering breakthrough, the station does not amount to mere storage units, but rather features digital power plants capable of creating stability -- generating their own voltage and frequency signals to improve the local grid infrastructure.

Now, the project's photovoltaic output has increased from the previous maximum of 1.5MW to 12MW. ""Over 10 days of monitoring, Huawei's grid-forming energy storage maintained voltage and frequency stability through more than 40 major grid disturbances, achieving 100 percent reliability,"" said Yang Mingsheng, general manager of the project.

This grid-forming tech has taken off in Xizang, with 2,522 MWh of grid-forming energy storage capacity built there in 2024, marking China's first large-scale application of such technology.

Also, it has gained global recognition. In Saudi Arabia, the grid-forming system has enabled the world's largest 100-percent new energy microgrid project -- which has been operating stably for over 21 months and has supplied more than 1.5 billion kWh of green electricity.

The next three CfD rounds must therefore secure an additional 20GW- equivalent to powering around 15 million homes.

Only two offshore wind generation projects – GreenVolt in Scotland and East Anglia Two – have been supported by the government’s CfD scheme since 2022.

A clear regulatory framework that secures investment and maintains the UK’s position as a global leader in offshore wind is now imperative.

Offshore wind is one of the UK’s greatest energy success stories – generating low carbon electricity at scale, creating jobs, and revitalising coastal communities.

Fixed-bottom turbines, with so-called monopiles attached to the seabed in shallower waters, have driven the UK’s rapid growth of wind energy generation to date but floating wind turbines using newer technologies, can be anchored in deeper waters with stronger wind resources, opening new areas for development.

They also have fewer environmental constraints than fixed-bottom projects and can progress more smoothly through the consenting process.

Speed and clarity to reform grid access and a more transparent approach with equal treatment for fixed and floating wind farms would give developers and the supply chain greater confidence to invest.

OEUK’s key recommendations for AR7 and beyond:

• Support for offshore wind: Provide assurance that sufficient funding is available for both fixed and commercial floating wind projects over the next three years, including projects to decarbonise offshore oil and gas operations, strengthen the UK supply chain, and create export opportunities.

• Grid and consent reform: Improved risk sharing between developers and grid network operators plus increased administrative capacity and streamlined planning to reduce delays to grid connection. Compensation should be offered for unexpected hold ups.

• Eligibility and investment: Reform eligibility criteria to allow both fixed and floating wind projects that have not received full consent to bid in the auction, extend CfD contracts from 15 to 20 years and introduce a well-balance cap and floor to transmission charges to improve investor confidence, lower subsidies and reduce costs to consumers. Introduce a well-balanced cap and floor to transmission charges.

OEUK’s Wind Energy Manager, Thibaut Cheret, said:

'AR7 must be the turning point in making UK wind ambitions a reality. That means enabling floating wind to compete on equal footing, unlocking grid access, and giving developers the confidence to invest at scale.

'We’re calling for clear eligibility rules that allow well-progressed but unconsented projects to bid, longer CfD terms to reduce costs to consumers, and a firm commitment to grid and consenting reform – including compensation for delays. These are the changes our members need to deliver the next 20GW.

'At the same time, we are working with our members to reduce project risk and borrowing costs as well as improving contractual relationships and promoting standardisation of modular wind turbine components to make them cheaper and faster to install.

'There is only one energy supply chain for offshore wind and oil and gas – and it cannot be allowed to decline. With the right reforms and a pragmatic energy strategy which supports homegrown oil and gas alongside the acceleration of UK renewables, the North Sea can remain a global energy powerhouse, supporting economic growth, jobs, and our climate goals.'

ScotWind: OEUK supports the ambition of the ScotWind leasing round and is calling for clarity on delivery timelines, grid access, and supply chain investment to ensure projects can rapidly move forward.

INTOG: OEUK backs INTOG schemes using wind energy to decarbonise offshore oil and gas production. We are urging government and regulators to ensure these projects are prioritised for grid access and CfD eligibility, and that planning processes reflect their dual role in emissions reduction and clean power generation.

Celtic Sea Round 5 of Celtic Sea wind auctions held last month (June) aims to unlock the potential for floating offshore wind off the coasts of South Wales and Southwest England. The Crown Estate has selected Equinor and Gwynt Glas to develop two 1.5GW floating wind farms. The leases come with grid connections already approved, but only two out of three leases on offer have been taken up.

TNUoS: Transmission Network Use of System Charges. Transmission has a cost which is paid by the generator and the user which appears in electricity bills. This cost is expected to increase dramatically in future years as more energy is brought from Scotland to England. The connection cost for the generator rises for remote areas but in heavily populated areas generators are paid to connect. The price difference must be adjusted with a proposed cap and floor system that would introduce an upper maximum cost to Scottish projects.

Review of electricity market arrangements (REMA): The government is still to announce the full outcome of its REMA consultation beyond the already published decision on zonal pricing. OEUK is calling for introduction of ‘deemed contracts for difference’ (based on potential, not actual output). This would mean wind energy producers being paid according to their potential capacity in a system that would give producers the opportunity to benefit from high global wind energy prices when they are available and keep a proportion of the additional profits

In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.","One of the drivers of these disruptions in the electricity market has been the EPA’s regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. This has been the case with its carbon rule, which would have shut down the nation’s fleet of coal power plants despite warnings from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation that more than half of the United States is at risk for electricity shortages over the next five years.

The risk of electricity shortages is being fueled by the explosion in electricity demand from artificial intelligence and the new data centers required to power this technology. An Energy Department report found that the amount of U.S. electricity consumed by data centers is expected to jump from 4.4% in 2023 to between 6.7% and 12% by 2028.

While electricity providers and grid operators have been talking about how to prepare for this massive demand spike, EPA regulations have made their job even more challenging. For example, the carbon rule would have illegally forced utilities to either shift generations away from coal, install expensive and unproven technology on existing coal plants, or shut the plants down altogether. Already, more than 120 coal units across 32 states are now scheduled to shut down within the next five years, unless steps are taken to stop these retirements. The carbon rule would have made matters even worse.

The goal of the Biden carbon rule was to make the U.S. reliant on wind and solar power, but such a dramatic transition carries heavy risks to the reliability of our grid.

We can look to the recent blackouts in Europe as a warning for us here in our country. For example, Spain has pursued aggressive policies to transition its grid to renewables. On April 16, the country boasted that for the first time, and for just a few minutes, renewables were delivering 100% of the nation’s electricity. Just 12 days later, a grid failure led to a prolonged blackout that plunged the country into darkness for days.

Solar and wind are intermittent sources of electricity because they, unlike coal, lack the capabilities necessary to serve as baseload sources of power capable of meeting demand at all hours and in all weather conditions. And it is reliable, dispatchable power that will be required to meet the demands of data centers, which operate 24/7.

In addition to hurting our nation’s electric reliability, the Biden-era carbon rule also undermines our national security. While premature coal retirements shrink America’s power supply, China is rapidly building new coal plants to strengthen its grid and expand its economy.

WHY THE KREMLIN HAS DELEGATED ITS TRUMP REBUKES TO STATE MEDIA

China, which already has the world’s largest coal fleet, plans to build another 420,000 megawatts of coal power. With these additions, China’s coal fleet will be almost 10 times larger than that of the U.S. Coal’s resurgence in China and other countries including India underscores how taking America’s coal fleet offline would make little impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. Today, the U.S. power sector is responsible for just 3% of global carbon emissions.

The growth of AI and other advanced technologies will require the U.S. to build new sources of electricity generation, but at a minimum, we need to stop needlessly retiring our existing coal fleet. In repealing the carbon rule, the Trump administration is ensuring that our country’s electric grid will be more reliable and that America can continue to remain an economic superpower in the century ahead.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited.
Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two.
Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel.
The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species.","EV battery cooling tech has come pretty far in the last 30 years. The GM EV1, for instance, was reengineered in 1999 with an air tunnel to properly cool its optional nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, but it still couldn't be sold in Arizona because the battery still got too hot. Now, however, we have advanced cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch-style lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with liquid cooling (typically ethylene glycol, a.k.a. antifreeze) and active air solutions to handle environmental extremes — even in Arizona.

Passive air cooling, as seen in the original Nissan Leaf, is simple and cost-effective, but its cooling ability is limited. Active air cooling employs fans or chilled air from the HVAC system, and is still the method used by the Lexus UX300e, though indirect liquid cooling can better tackle current EV power levels. Direct liquid cooling isn't used for consumer EVs because the batteries would need to make, well, direct contact with a liquid, and it would need to have zero electrical conductivity to avoid shorting the battery.

Most EVs use cold plates (also called cooling plates), which feature coolant passages strewn through a flat sheet of metal adhered directly to the bottoms of battery cells. Cold plates are usually made of aluminum alloy, stainless steel, or copper and can cool one pack of cells or two. Rivian, Hyundai, Ford, GM, and Lucid all use cold plates. Tesla, on the other hand, routes coolant pipes throughout the cells, which may be done so that its 4680 batteries can vent from the bottom in case of thermal runaway, or to be different and make this article longer.

Tesla's battery cooling has undergone quite a few revisions to improve temperature regulation of its cylindrical cells. In the Model S P85D, one coolant path chills 444 cells. The problem is that coolant gets quite warm by the end of its journey, especially given how many cells it must handle. So, for the P100D, Tesla switched to two paths that each cool 258 cells. In the Model S Plaid, 11 individual coolant pipes are responsible for just 144 cells each. Coolant passages also changed from being relatively straight up to 2017, meaning they contacted a small portion of each cell's side, to serpentine in 2018, dramatically improving the contact patch.

While Tesla has refined intra-cell piping, cold plates have two big advantages. First, cold plates allow the battery to have more cells packed horizontally. Second, as Peter Rawlinson of Lucid told Auto Evolution, cold plates in the remarkably quick Lucid Air Sapphire cool the battery more efficiently since they contact the bottom of the cell, or the anode, where much of the heat builds up. Either way, temperature monitoring ensures the battery stays in a safe, usable range.

Each automaker employs cold plates in its own way. Lucid uses a super-thin layer of adhesive to join the cells to each cold plate for the best possible thermal conductivity, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 uses a comparatively thick adhesive that results in more distance between the cells and the plate. However, the Ioniq 5 also uses one massive cold plate rather than individual plates for each battery pack. Rivian uses cold plates too, but sandwiches them between the cells to cool two layers at once.

The Hummer EV, a vehicle larger than some buildings, places cold plates on top of individual battery packs in a gargantuan steel enclosure. These cold plates can become hot plates, warming the battery to the optimal temperature range when entering Watts To Freedom (WTF) mode, unlocking the full 1,000 hp. The Hummer's heat pump also chills the motors for peak efficiency.

Ford's F-150 Lightning also uses cold plates, but places battery packs in aluminum enclosures rather than steel. Not only is aluminum lighter, but it's more efficient at dissipating heat. Of course, the Hummer EV 3X doesn't care about the weight of steel because it makes 1,000 hp and a ridiculous 11,500 lb-ft of torque, if you listen to marketing, or a more realistic but still insane 1,000 to 1,100 lb-ft (if you go by Road & Track and Autoweek's reporting).

If a Hummer EV is like winning the torque Powerball, an extended range Ford F-150 Lightning at 580 hp and 775 lb-ft is still like winning a $500 a week for life scratch-off. Incredible, but not quite in the same power ballpark. Plus, if Hummers have to heat the battery in WTF mode anyway, steel's thermal properties might be irrelevant. Strange how the Hummer EV is the least efficient EV you can buy.

The huge variety of cooling solutions is mind-boggling, and detailing every system would result in a Dostoyevsky-length novel. The gist is that passive air cooling has gone the way of dodos, active air cooling is almost extinct, and liquid cooling is the still-thriving dominant species. Still, like Galapagos finch beaks, there's still plenty of micro-evolution happening, like GM's U-shaped prismatic batteries, and we have yet to see which changes help EVs adapt to our world the best.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/how-electric-vehicles-like-teslas-fords-gms-keep-batteries-cool/l-intro-1752183144.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:23:05.545757

Recent research suggests that natural hydrogen, continuously produced by the Earth’s crust, could power our planet for an astounding 170,000 years. This immense potential transforms the conversation around energy transitions, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a future powered by a resource that has been quietly accumulating for millions, if not billions, of years. But what is the reality of accessing this hidden treasure?

An Abundant Yet Largely Untapped Gas

Hydrogen today is pivotal in various industrial applications, such as ammonia and methanol production. It’s also heralded as a clean energy carrier, with the potential to power vehicles and energy grids. However, most of this hydrogen is derived from hydrocarbons, which emit greenhouse gases during production. Natural hydrogen, in contrast, forms without human intervention through geochemical reactions between specific rocks and water, emitting no carbon and requiring no external energy input. This naturally occurring hydrogen can remain trapped underground for thousands of years, creating potentially exploitable reserves.

While these reserves were once thought rare, recent studies indicate they might be widespread if we know where to look. This revelation could significantly alter our approach to clean energy, as natural hydrogen represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional energy sources.

“This Reactor Is a Game-Changer for America”: US Launches World’s First Nuclear Plant Producing Hydrogen, Triggering a New Era in Clean Energy

The Three Key Conditions for Deposit Formation

According to geochemist Chris Ballentine and his team, creating a natural hydrogen deposit depends on three critical elements: a production source, a reservoir for gas storage, and a geological barrier to trap it. Production typically results from geochemical processes, with the most common being the reaction of iron or magnesium-rich rocks with water, continuously releasing hydrogen underground.

The reservoir must be sufficiently porous to store hydrogen, while the cap rock, often composed of clays or salts, must prevent the gas from escaping. These criteria, familiar in the oil and gas industry, can now be applied to hydrogen exploration, opening new avenues for sustainable energy sourcing. Understanding these geological conditions is essential for identifying viable hydrogen reserves.

“The Future Is Here, and It’s Terrifying”: World’s First Hydrogen-Generating Nuclear Reactor Launches in the US, Sparking Global Energy Revolution

Promising Geological Regions

Certain geological formations are particularly conducive to hydrogen accumulation. These include ophiolites, which are ancient oceanic floors lifted to the surface, igneous provinces with volcanic rock, and ancient greenstone belts, some over three billion years old.

In the United States, attention is focused on Kansas, where an old rift zone rich in basalts may contain significant hydrogen reserves. In Albania, a vast reservoir has been identified within an ophiolite complex. These discoveries are attracting industrial interest from companies like Koloma, backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, and others like Hy-Terra and Snowfox, supported by major energy corporations.

“This Changes Everything Overnight”: New US Fuel Cell Simultaneously Generates Power, Stores Massive Energy, and Delivers Clean Hydrogen Without Compromise

A Parameter Not to Overlook: Bacteria

Despite the potential abundance of underground hydrogen, its exploitation is not guaranteed. Subsurface bacteria that consume hydrogen can significantly reduce available volumes. According to researcher Barbara Sherwood Lollar, environments conducive to these microorganisms are less promising for exploration. Understanding and mitigating this biological factor is crucial for assessing the true potential of natural hydrogen deposits.

A Roadmap for Exploration

The study offers a comprehensive synthesis of hydrogen formation and accumulation mechanisms, providing geologists and energy companies with a clear roadmap for exploration. It guides exploration campaigns toward areas most likely to contain economically viable deposits.

While uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the extractable quantity of natural hydrogen, the prospects are immense. An abundant, naturally renewing, clean resource already stored underground could make natural hydrogen a central player in the energy transition over the coming decades. What new developments will unfold as we continue to explore this untapped energy frontier?

While the program promises to unlock £50bn in economic potential by 2030, investors must navigate a complex landscape of subsidies, energy costs, and regulatory hurdles to capitalize on emerging opportunities. This analysis dissects the strategic advantages and risks tied to the sector's transformation, offering actionable insights for investors.

Funding the Transition: Targeting Pain Points with Precision

The DRIVE35 program allocates £2bn for R&D in automotive and related sectors by 2030, alongside an additional £500m for scale-up grants (up to £20m per project). This funding directly addresses three critical pain points:

1. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: By prioritizing battery production, gigafactories, and green hydrogen infrastructure, the UK aims to reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.

2. Private Investment Gaps: The £6.6bn target for private capital underscores the government's role in de-risking projects like battery manufacturing and software-defined vehicles.

3. Competitiveness: Scale-up grants for EV technologies (e.g., vehicle-to-grid systems) position UK firms to dominate emerging markets.

The program's focus on sectors like EV charging infrastructure (£400m allocated) and defense-aligned dual-use tech also creates niches for specialized firms.

Trade Deals: A Competitive Edge, but Not Without Hurdles

Recent trade agreements have slashed tariffs and expanded markets:

- UK-US Deal: Tariffs on cars exported to the US fell from 27.5% to 10%, benefiting luxury brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin.

- India Deal: A 100% tariff reduction to 10% opens a booming market for high-end vehicles.

- CPTPP Access: Entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership grants access to £12tn in markets, though automotive specifics remain under negotiation.

However, the EU-UK “reset” remains incomplete. Rules of origin ambiguities and lingering customs delays could undermine the 80% of UK car exports that still rely on EU supply chains.

The Energy Cost Conundrum: A Make-or-Break Factor

High energy prices threaten to negate the sector's potential. UK manufacturers pay up to four times more for electricity than US competitors, with battery producers in Scotland facing costs 20% higher than in Germany. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme aims to reduce industrial electricity costs by £35–40/MWh, but its narrow focus on battery production—excluding broader automotive manufacturing—leaves critical gaps.

Without extending relief to the entire sector, the UK risks losing investment to lower-cost regions like Spain or Poland.

EV Market Challenges: Lagging Demand and Policy Uncertainty

Despite £6.5bn in industry investments to boost EV adoption, sales fell 12.8% in early 2025, underscoring the need for urgent reforms:

- Tax Incentives: The Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and Expensive Car Supplement (ECS) penalize EV buyers, costing the sector £360m annually.

- Regulatory Volatility: Past reversals on ZEV mandates have eroded industry confidence. SMMT estimates that halving EV VAT could shift 2m sales to electric by 2030.

The 2030 ICE phaseout remains at risk unless policies align with consumer affordability and charging infrastructure.

Unlocking the £50bn Potential: The Path Forward

To realize this economic ambition, the UK must:

1. Accelerate Energy Cost Reforms: Extend the competitiveness scheme to all automotive manufacturers, not just battery producers.

2. Fix the Tax Code: Remove punitive levies like the ECS and reinstate EV purchase incentives.

3. Streamline Regulation: Finalize the Subsidy Advice Unit's review of DRIVE35 grants (due August 2025) and align EU battery recycling rules to avoid trade barriers.

4. Invest in Skills: Scale up apprenticeships and visas for tech talent in AI and engineering.

Investment Strategy: Where to Focus

Opportunities to Watch:

- Battery Manufacturers: Companies like Britishvolt or those partnering with gigafactories (e.g., Tata's £1bn Somerset plant) stand to benefit from £5.8bn allocated to energy storage.

- EV Charging Infrastructure: Firms like EO Charging or Pivot Power, which operate nationwide networks, are critical to meeting the £1.4bn EV uptake goal.

- Software-Defined Vehicles: Startups developing autonomous driving or V2G tech may attract DRIVE35 grants.

Risks to Monitor:

- Energy Cost Delays: A failure to address Scotland's high tariffs or extend reforms could trigger capital flight.

- Policy Inconsistency: Fluctuating ZEV mandates or EU trade disputes could disrupt supply chains.

- Global Competition: China's dominance (31% of global vehicle output) and U.S. subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act require agility.

Conclusion: A High-Reward, High-Risk Journey

The DRIVE35 program and trade deals offer a clear roadmap for the UK to become a ZEV manufacturing powerhouse.

Blackouts in Yucatán Follow Regional Pattern Yucatán’s frequent blackouts, brownouts and appliance-killing power surges reflect chronic electrical infrastructure challenges that stretch back years.
Dr. Rubén Domínguez Maldonado from Anáhuac Mayab University told reporters that without scheduled blackouts, heat damage to lines and transformers would create more expensive repairs and longer Yucatán blackouts.
Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours.
Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.","A summer of blackouts in Yucatán will extend into Monday as the Federal Electricity Commission schedules power cuts for 16 coastal communities. The planned blackouts will run from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., though CFE said the work might take less than eight hours.

Temperatures along the coast are expected to reach almost 90°F / 32°C under sunny skies. Residents will be relying on Gulf breezes to stay cool.

The scheduled blackouts affect Progreso and surrounding areas. CFE said the work connects a new substation and modernizes the electrical system in response to ongoing power cuts that have plagued the region.

The announcement follows weeks of unplanned blackouts across Yucatán. Some neighborhoods in Mérida and Campeche have experienced frequent and prolonged power failures, leaving residents without electricity, clean water, or basic services. In southern Mérida, residents of the Zazil-Há and Cinco Colonias neighborhoods have endured constant Yucatán blackouts for two weeks, lasting several hours at a time.

Blackouts in Yucatán Follow Regional Pattern

Yucatán’s frequent blackouts, brownouts and appliance-killing power surges reflect chronic electrical infrastructure challenges that stretch back years. In May 2024, blackouts hit 21 of Mexico’s 32 states, forcing the National Energy Control Center to declare emergency conditions multiple times. Blackouts in Yucatán weren’t spared from the national crisis.

The CFE electrical network is stressed due to excessive demand for supply to mitigate the extreme heat that prevails during Yucatán blackouts. Local experts say the blackouts in Yucatán require long-term fixes. Dr. Rubén Domínguez Maldonado from Anáhuac Mayab University told reporters that without scheduled blackouts, heat damage to lines and transformers would create more expensive repairs and longer Yucatán blackouts.

Residents report Yucatán blackouts occurring daily and lasting anywhere from a few hours to 14 hours. The persistent have pushed some communities to protest. Residents decided to close Calle 50A from 119 to 131, in protest after weeks of unreliable power and recurring Yucatán blackouts.

Political Response Draws Criticism

President Claudia Sheinbaum’s June visit to Yucatán sparked controversy over her comments about the blackouts in Yucatán. She declared that “the opposition’s campaign about the lack of electricity in Yucatán is not in line with reality, since there is sufficient infrastructure.”

Her statement contrasted sharply with residents’ experiences of Yucatán blackouts. In communities like Cheumán, families with babies struggle to store milk and food for their children during extended blackouts in Yucatán. Local researcher Gina Villagómez Valdés documented cases where residents have been without power for days, with blackouts damaging their electrical appliances.

CFE has announced multiple infrastructure projects over the years to address blackouts in Yucatán with mixed results. In 2019, President López Obrador promised a new power plant during a Yucatan tour, declaring it would ensure “there will never be any blackouts” in the state. However, energy sector experts noted that this promised plant was not part of CFE’s strategic plan to address Yucatán’s frequent power failures.

CFE has invested over 151 billion pesos to improve energy supply and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, including plans for two combined-cycle power plants in Mérida and Valladolid. The plants were originally scheduled to begin operations by summer 2024 to help end Yucatán blackouts, but delays pushed timelines into the future.

The Yucatán state government now works with CFE on a plan to eliminate blackouts by 2027 and achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2030. Governor Joaquín Díaz Mena acknowledged that “Yucatán is facing a complex energy situation, especially during this season of extreme heat” that contributes to blackouts in Yucatán.

National Investment Plans Target Blackouts

The Mexican government presented a National Strategy for the Electricity Sector 2024-2030, planning to invest $23 billion in CFE to address nationwide power issues including Yucatán blackouts. CFE’s 2025-2030 plan includes 12 new power plants with combined capacity of 5,840MW across nine states. However, Yucatán isn’t among the states getting new generation facilities to directly combat blackouts in Yucatán.

To prepare for increased demand during summer 2025 and reduce blackouts in Yucatán, capacitor banks will be installed in seven substations in northern Quintana Roo, representing an investment of 194.39 million pesos ($9.32 million).

Beyond generation capacity, Yucatán blackouts stem from fundamental infrastructure problems. Aging infrastructure and “a mess of ancient wiring” continues to cause blackouts in Yucatán, with haphazardly installed power, telephone, and fiber optic lines characterizing most streets. CFE employees revealed that Yucatán blackouts during the hot season are inevitable due to overloaded connections in new subdivisions.

The communities affected by Monday’s scheduled blackouts include Progreso, Chelem, Chicxulub Puerto, Chuburná Puerto, Dzidzilché, San Ignacio, Misné Balam, Flamboyanes, Santa María Chí, Tamanché, Cosgaya, Komchén, Suytunchén, Kikteil, Xcunyá and Sierra Papacal.

CFE Director General Emilia Esther Calleja Alor recently visited the state and pledged to provide advance notice of future scheduled blackouts to help residents prepare for planned Yucatán blackouts. The commission emphasized these actions “seek to improve the energy infrastructure for the benefit of residents” and businesses in the coastal area affected by recurring blackouts in Yucatán.

For international visitors and residents, the ongoing Yucatán blackouts represent a significant infrastructure concern in a region that depends heavily on tourism and economic development. The peninsula covers roughly 70,000 square miles (181,000 square kilometers) and includes popular destinations like Cancún, Mérida, and the Riviera Maya, all affected by periodic blackouts.",https://yucatanmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CFEexpensive.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:22:44.318149

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications.
The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.
Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities.
The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners.","For years, Wabanaki tribal communities faced a costly dilemma: pay outside contractors $500 to $1,000 per home for energy audits, or go without services that could slash utility bills for hundreds of tribal members.

Now, the federally recognized tribes in Maine are trying a different approach. They’re training their own members as energy auditors and heat-pump technicians, creating immediate cost savings and long-term career pathways that keep energy dollars flowing within the tribal communities.

“We don't want to go outside of the nations to get these services,” Kelsey Flores, coordinator of the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team, told Tribal Business News. “The overall goal is to feed into our resilience and our self-sufficiency.”

The workforce development strategy represents a shift toward self-sufficiency that has become even more urgent after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded a $1.1 million grant in May that supported the tribes’ renewable energy programs.

The effort is led by the Wabanaki Sustainable Energy Team. The team is composed of representatives from four Native nations: the Penobscot Nation; the Passamaquoddy Tribe (with communities at Pleasant Point and Indian Township); the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians; and the Mi'kmaq Nation. The team also includes partners at the University of Maine.

The team is now offering two energy-related workforce development programs: energy audit training available free to members of the Penobscot Nation, and a three-week pre-apprenticeship program on heat pump installation for up to 20 members of the Wabanaki tribes.

The energy audit training program offers multiple certification levels, including building science principles and building analyst technician certifications. The sessions begin July 18 and Aug. 22, according to George Callas, founder of energy training firm Build Green Maine.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Training costs are covered by the Penobscot Nation, and applications are still being accepted for the program through reaching out to Flores or by contacting Build Green Maine directly through their website.

The training is conducted online, with Callas leading the courses and providing ongoing mentorship to help participants interested in launching their own energy audit businesses. Participants in the program can reduce their home energy consumption by 25% and successful business owners could potentially audit hundreds of homes, Callas told Tribal Business News.

“There’s a couple of different degrees of accomplishment here,” Callas said. “When people come through and do training like ours, they often look around their own house and make changes, at the very least. Some people go on to be entrepreneurs, who will run with this and make it a business to provide this service for other people, or help contractors looking to install things like insulation and sealing.”

The heat pump training takes a different approach, focusing on construction trades and union careers. The three-week pre-apprenticeship program is open to Wabanaki tribal members or descendants who have a high school diploma or equivalent and a valid driver's license, according to Sam Boss, apprenticeship and workforce development director for the Maine chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). The program covers lodging, tuition and up to $150 in gas cards for selected trainees.

Trainees will work through basic electrical and construction certifications, learn the tools of the trade, and help install heat pumps in Wabanaki tribal communities. The program will train 20 people from across the Wabanaki nations, and applications are still being accepted through Flores with an Aug. 4 deadline.

Boss said the program prepares participants for union apprenticeships that offer paid training, benefits, healthcare and pensions.

“Usually, these pre apprenticeship programs are considered a first step on your pathway to getting into a registered apprenticeship with a union,” Boss told Tribal Business News. “[Those apprenticeships] are a great pathway into the trades, because you're not going into debt, you're getting benefits, great health care and a pension.”

Heat pumps have become increasingly popular in Maine, which has installed more than 100,000 of the energy efficient devices over the past decade — three times the national average, according to Bloomberg. The state’s push toward heat pump adoption has created growing demand for skilled installers.

The workforce programs are moving forward in this growing market, despite losing a primary funding source. Community action grants through the state of Maine have enabled Flores to stay in her position as coordinator and supported the energy audit training. The AFL-CIO partnership has enabled the August 11-29 heat pump training session to continue.

The University of Maine is pursuing a legal dispute to try to recover the EPA funding, according to Flores.

The funding loss highlighted the vulnerability of federal support and reinforced the need for economic strategies that don't depend on government programs, Flores said.

""It's really unfortunate to see how easy it is to strip away crucial funding that was set to positively impact these communities that have been historically underserved,"" Flores said.

But the setback hasn't derailed the long-term vision. The Sustainable Energy Team continues to meet monthly to discuss strategies for expanding the programs and finding non-federal partners. The ultimate goal is creating tribally-owned businesses in the green energy sector that can serve both tribal and broader markets.

“The Wabanaki Nations have always been and will always be resilient, so their energy, visions and goals will remain the same,” Flores said. “We are more than open to expanding our network, solidifying our partnerships, and really working with any partner that is willing to support these projects.”

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue.","United States president Donald Trump expressed his disdain for wind power during a meeting with his Cabinet recently, calling it an expensive form of energy that ""smart"" countries don't use.

His comments contained false and misleading information about the use of wind power in the U.S. and around the world, and came on the heels of an executive order he signed Monday that would end subsidies around ""green"" energy, reports The Associated Press.

Here's a look at the facts.

CLAIM: ""Wind is a very expensive form of energy.""

THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce electricity around US$30 per megawatt hour. This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Onshore wind farms cost less to build and operate than natural gas plants on average in most regions of the U.S., even without tax credits. Though-gas plants are available to produce electricity at any time of the day, unlike wind. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, according to the EIA.

While electricity rates have risen across the U.S. over the past decade, states that have added a significant amount of onshore wind power, such as Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have kept rates from rising as fast as other states, said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation. For example, the share of electricity generated from wind in Iowa increased from 15% in 2010 to nearly 60% of the state's electricity generation in 2023, while the state's electricity rates grew at a rate slower than that of 42 other states, his research found.

Wind power can be expensive if it's built where winds are weaker, but the United States is adding it in places with strong wind resources, he added.

""Wind should be seen as part of an overall portfolio of electricity system resources and is an important part of keeping costs down,"" he said Wednesday.

Trump has committed to increasing U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels. He signed an executive order Monday aimed at phasing out tax credits for wind and solar facilities.

CLAIM: Wind turbines are ""almost exclusively"" made in China, but President Xi Jinping told Trump they have ""very, very few.""

THE FACTS: China is the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines, producing more than half of the supply. It is also installing them in China at a record pace. In total, China has 1.3 terawatts of utility-scale wind and solar capacity in development, which could generate more electricity than neighbouring Japan consumed in all of 2023, according to a report from the Global Energy Monitor released Wednesday. The report highlighted China's offshore wind development, calling China the undisputed leader in the offshore wind sector, though it also said coal and gas are still on the rise across China.

""The whole narrative that we're led to believe in the West is that China is building coal plants and that it's doing nothing for its carbon footprint,"" Tom Harper, partner at the global consultant Baringa, said Tuesday. ""So the surprising thing is China is building a portfolio of zero-carbon resources that are designed to not perfectly complement each other, but to work alongside each other to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.""

CLAIM: ""If you look at smart countries, they don't use it.""

THE FACTS: At least 136 countries and territories around the world use wind power to generate electricity, according to the EIA, with many countries growing the amount they produce. The top five markets for wind power in 2024 were China, the U.S., Brazil, India and Germany, while Uzbekistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia represent the next wave of wind energy growth, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Council CEO Ben Backwell said 2024 marked yet another record year for wind energy growth, with the ""industry increasingly pushing into new regions.""

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, disputed the idea that smart countries don't use wind power. China is soaring ahead in building a massive amount of wind power while Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Sweden, France and many other countries in Europe have large programs of wind construction, he said Wednesday.

""By cutting back on wind power development, the U.S. is ceding the lead to China in this important technology, and killing a lot of U.S. jobs,"" Gerrard said in an e-mail.

CLAIM: In New England, two whales washed up over 50 years, ""and last summer they had 14 washed up. Now, I'm not saying that's the wind farm that was built, that maybe it is right.""

THE FACTS: There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA says it analyzes the causes of death whenever possible, following the science and data. Unfounded claims about offshore wind threatening whales have surfaced as a flashpoint in the fight over the future of renewable energy.

The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm officially opened in 2024 east of Montauk Point, New York. The nation's second-largest offshore wind farm is under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. A five-turbine pilot project has been operating since 2016 off the coast of Rhode Island.

CLAIM: ""The birds are dying all over the place.""

THE FACTS: Turbines, like all infrastructure, can pose a risk to birds. However, the National Audubon Society, which is dedicated to the conservation of birds, thinks developers can manage these risks and climate change is a greater threat. An Audubon report found that two-thirds of North American bird species could face extinction due to rising temperatures.

In January, the nonprofit said responsible offshore wind development is a clear win for birds, the U.S. economy and the climate.

""While persistent myths claim widespread and devastating effects of offshore wind turbines on wildlife, the science tells a different story. Our findings clearly indicate that we can responsibly deploy offshore wind in a manner that still protects birds and their habitats,"" Sam Wojcicki, Audubon's senior director for climate policy, wrote in a January post. The organization also supports wind energy on land when it is sited and operated properly to minimize the impact on birds and other wildlife.

CLAIM: ""You can't take them down because the environmentalists don't let you bury the blades.""

THE FACTS: Wind turbine blades are challenging to recycle. They are designed for durability to withstand hurricane-force winds. However, the U.S. already has the ability to recycle most wind turbine materials, according to the Department of Energy. It issued a report in January that found 90% of wind turbines can be recycled using existing infrastructure, while new strategies and innovative recycling methods will be needed to tackle the rest.

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue. Danish wind energy developer rsted committed in 2021 to never sending turbine blades to landfill, instead reusing, recycling or otherwise recovering them.

In January, the nonprofit said responsible offshore wind development is a clear win for birds, the U.S. economy and the climate.

""While persistent myths claim widespread and devastating effects of offshore wind turbines on wildlife, the science tells a different story. Our findings clearly indicate that we can responsibly deploy offshore wind in a manner that still protects birds and their habitats,"" Sam Wojcicki, Audubon's senior director for climate policy, wrote in a January post. The organization also supports wind energy on land when it is sited and operated properly to minimize the impact on birds and other wildlife.

CLAIM: ""You can't take them down because the environmentalists don't let you bury the blades.""

THE FACTS: Wind turbine blades are challenging to recycle. They are designed for durability to withstand hurricane-force winds. However, the U.S. already has the ability to recycle most wind turbine materials, according to the Department of Energy. It issued a report in January that found 90% of wind turbines can be recycled using existing infrastructure, while new strategies and innovative recycling methods will be needed to tackle the rest.

The wind power industry acknowledges that the disposal of wind turbine blades is an issue. Danish wind energy developer rsted committed in 2021 to never sending turbine blades to landfill, instead reusing, recycling or otherwise recovering them.

The Japanese automakerNissan Raises $4.5 Billion to Ease Debt Pressure as EV Plans Slow Down has secured $4.5 billion through a fresh bond sale in U.S. dollars and euros, aiming to buy itself time and space to manage a growing pile of debt.

The funds will help Nissan refinance around ¥700 billion (roughly $4.76 billion) in debt due this fiscal year. It’s a necessary move for a company that’s facing rising costs, a tougher EV market, and a recent downgrade to “junk” status by all three major credit agencies.

Borrowing Now, Breathing Room Later

According to a term sheet seen by Reuters, Nissan issued three dollar-denominated bond tranches worth $3 billion, alongside two euro tranches totaling €1.3 billion ($1.52 billion). The bonds stretch over four to ten years, with interest rates between 7.5% and 8.125% — higher than usual, but expected for a company under pressure.

For Nissan, this isn’t just about numbers, it’s about regaining financial footing after a few difficult years.

EV Plans Postponed as Caution Sets In

Nissan’s ambitions in the electric vehicle space are being quietly scaled back, especially in North America. Two new electric SUVs, one for Nissan, the other for its luxury brand Infiniti — were supposed to roll out of its Mississippi plant by 2028. That timeline has now slipped to late 2028 or even 2029.

It’s a reflection of the bigger picture: EV demand isn’t as hot as it once seemed. Policy shifts in the U.S., especially the rollback of key tax credits and the introduction of a 25% tariff on vehicle exports to Canada, are making things even more complicated. In response, Nissan has pulled two EVs from its U.S. lineup and halted Canadian shipments altogether.

Holding Tight to Cash

To conserve money, Nissan has reportedly asked some of its suppliers to delay payments — a tough ask that hints at internal cash flow concerns. At the same time, its battery partner AESC has paused work on a new factory in South Carolina. That site was meant to support Nissan’s EV production, but with plans now in flux, the construction has been put on hold.

These choices aren’t easy, but they show a company trying to stay afloat while recalibrating its path forward.

Investors Still Hopeful, For Now

Interestingly, retail investors are staying optimistic. Social platform Stocktwits reported a spike in discussions about Nissan, with sentiment labeled “bullish” and message volume marked “extremely high.” Whether this is grounded in confidence or just speculation remains to be seen.

A Company at the Crossroads

Nissan’s story right now is about survival but also resilience. It’s juggling short-term financial fixes while rewriting long-term plans in a shifting industry. The $4.5 billion it just raised doesn’t solve everything, but it gives the automaker breathing room to regroup.

For a company once seen as an EV pioneer, the road ahead is uncertain, but not closed.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NISSAN-RESTRUCTURING-0_1747051237324_1747051249381.jpeg,N,,2025-07-13 11:20:40.120845
